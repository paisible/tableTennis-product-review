48|5f6c28634272aba9ab775707|Blocking is easier with Mark V than with Aurus Soft – obviously, opponents differ in how much kick they can put on their loops, but against some people, I feel I could just block reliably all day with Mark V. Unsure about how much different service spin generation is – I like to throw in some backhand swipe serves with heavy sidespin, and my vague feeling is that it takes a little more elbow grease with the Mark V.When I come off Mark V next year, I'll probably go back to Aurus Soft, or maybe back to Victas V-15 Limber, whose soft, slow feel I didn't like before; but which might be a good compromise between the control of Mark V and the relatively greater catapult of Aurus Soft.|Tibhar-Aurus-Soft|Yasaka-Mark-V|speed|l
