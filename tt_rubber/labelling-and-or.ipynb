Mind you, they're all quite similar (hard sponged Tensor-type rubbers). And the current bat I'm using has one of those $5 sheets of Palio Emperor Dragon on it and while I can tell the difference between it and Rakza X, it doesn't affect what shots I can make and what I can't. Blades are different - I find a great deal more difference when switching blades, those DO affect the shots, at least to a much greater extent than rubber does. I do have a sheet of Rakza 7 I will try next - going for softer sponge this time to see if it makes a difference (some people claim you get twice the spin compared to Rakza X.. True? Not true? Hyperbole? How do you measure it?  ). The previous choices of expensive rubber was mainly because I wanted to see if I could find a rubber that was so fast I could NOT use it (so far, failure.. they're all fairly easy to use  ). I do accept the fact that there are others who are a lot more sensitive to rubber differences than I am - after all, why do something like 95-97% of pros (even the Chinese!) use Tenergy 05 when a lot of them are sponsored by other companies and can presumably get other brands without having to pay out of their own pockets for it? The point is that comparing rubbers IS very subjective, because the differences are subtle, so writing good, useful reviews is 1) difficult, 2) might not matter in most cases anyhow, and therefore 3) not really worth obsessing over.

I don't get to play/practice often so faults in my game/technique I don't want to blame it on the rubber3. I have only ever owned 1 high end rubber before being butterfly tenergy 05 as my comparsionI wanted to have a video of me playing with it but my wife didn't want to stay at the tt club and wanted to grocery shop/errands & i don't think these old guys at the tt club would want to hold my phone and record me instead of playing.So two things that I feel stands out with this rubber.Its fast & loud. If you have good technique / foot work it is really fun to play with. My opponents were overpowered in topspin rallies or the ball came back to fast for them to respond against my loops & drives. I want to say more about this rubber but I don't want to misrepresent it because I rarely play/know all the techniques/technical aspects of the game and how a rubber should perform close,mid,far from table with the correct technique. Lets just say I had fun with it from all distances especially mid distance. Plus of going to a tt club is I got to try other players equipment as well as let them try mine. So I got to compare rhyzer 43 first hand specifically to tenergy 05 and joola rhyzm -P (both in max thickness that were both fairly new). To my eyes the rhyzer had more spin with harder/medium strokes and a more linear arc (but still safe arc to go over the net consistently) compared to the 05 & rhyzm -P. Rhyzer 43 was faster than T05 & J-P and the rhyzer 43 is on a slow blade being joola chen defender compared to the butterfly zlc blade & the other one was hinoki wood composition but i forget what it was. I liked this rubber alot so I ordered another 2 rhyzer 43 red+black in max thickness & ordered another chen defender blade. Our tt club is a seller/distributor of joola & butterfly products so he gets discounts from the manufacturer (mostly just discounts from joola). Those are my honest thoughts about this rubber. I hope to make a video of it to let the rubber speak for its self but I probably wont go back to the tt club until i have to pick up my order due to work and becoming a first time expecting father in just a couple of weeks. The other rubber i used on my blade was a cheap friendship 729 soft fx. Would prefer rhyzer 43 on both sides.\n",

      "After a few months I am actually getting on quite well with Rhyzer 43 2mm red for the following reasons1. The high initial catapult has reduced a bit and the top sheet and sponge feel a bit firmer probably due to the factory booster wearing off.2. I have switched it to the slower back hand side of my Black & White blade but still plenty fast for aggressive close to table forehand play. The extra dwell of the slow side makes easier to spin up the ball and gives more control on blocks, whilst the fast sponge still gives lots of speed when needed.3. Much improved technique. It took four weeks hitting ball everywhere but I now have a more compact swing with proper rotation. As often mentionsed these fast tensors reallly show up poor technique.Just bought a sheet of Andro R42 2mm for my harder Bloodhound blade. Will be an interesting comparison.\n",

Being a hard and low throw blade designed primarily for blocking with pips out rubbers finding a rubber that will enable close to the table spinney loops is quite difficult. The Rhyzer R43 was in fact remarkably effective having shrunk 2-3mm and lost most of its initial factory extreme tension, still fast and spinny but more controlled with a firmer much less bouncy feel.

So if that takes your mind off the idea of \"if there are better stuff out there\", it will let you perform your best.But, at the end of the day, ALL rubbers are energy dissipating material. If your swing speed approaches or exceeds 20 m/s, all rubbers will produce roughly the same speed. However, in all \"sub-optimal strokes\" some rubbers can generate more speed/spin. That being said, I can convince myself that there are other rubbers which generate more rebound or more spin than Tenergy 05 on less than perfect strokes.Feel on the other hand is more subtle. If you look at the older OOAK resources of topsheet/sponge hardness measurements, you can approximate the same feel with many different rubber types. Again, that being said, rubber manufacturing is not very precise (tenergy included), so one sheets might feel different than another of the same model...Take what you need to help you move on.\n",

Due to that, it isn't as springy as MX-P and feels a bit closer to the hybrid rubbers - although the throw is still higher than theirs. I feel that it allows for a little bit more spin that MX-P - but again, less than tacky rubbers do. You might have to adjust your FH loop a little if coming from a springy tensor rubber. Both over the table and middle distance play is good, in my opinion, I didn't feel any lack of power.I think it could work as a BH rubber, too, if you like the harder feeling.\n",

      "Would you please let us know wha tis your usual cleaning routine. I am personally interested in it cause I play STN too and simply would like to know what to expect from this rubber.I haven't used hurricane 8 myself, but I regularly play against two people who use H8. One guy uses soft version the other hard, H40. So, from what I can tell 40 degrees is a way harder than STN, so will really need to adjust. I dont think that tackiness of H8 lasts longer than STN.

I am personally interested in it cause I play STN too and simply would like to know what to expect from this rubber.I haven't used hurricane 8 myself, but I regularly play against two people who use H8. One guy uses soft version the other hard, H40. So, from what I can tell 40 degrees is a way harder than STN, so will really need to adjust. I dont think that tackiness of H8 lasts longer than STN.

      "Thank you for the recon recommendation. Hurricane 3 provincial comes with yellow and blue sponge. What is the difference between them? The blue sponge version is much more expensive.My usual cleaning routine is to wipe off the rubber with a wet sponge and put a non-sticky plastic sheet on it. If you say the level of tack is the same for Hurricane 3 compared to STN, that would mean it shouldn't make a difference at least from that perspective. The sponges may be different but that wasn't my primary complaint about the STN so it may or may not matter for me to go with a different rubber. That leaves me in a dilemma whether I should even change it at this time.Too many decisions..  Thanks!\n",

      "I do pretty much the same, but in addition, in the end of the week I use droplet of liquid soap and water to get rid of sweat. Once dried, ball will then stick for long time. No magic really. And I agree there is no point in changing rubber brand if you are only after better tackiness. But ...On the other hand why do we need tackiness? People tend to think that it helps to spin the ball. Yes sure it does, so why not all rubbers are made tacky!? Jap style rubbers, for example Palio AK47 red or blue, would spin your ball not less than tacky STN, but these are just \"grippy\" top sheets and not sticky at all.Sure you know it better than me that tackiness in Chinese classic rubbers is to compensate for the otherwise short dwell time because of hard sponge. Did you notice that if top sheet is not tacky then it will not have hard sponge. And opposite, if there is hard sponge then topsheet is made tacky to win back some dwell time. So what I am trying to say here that when we choose to go for tacky Chinese rubbers we normally want to get that hard sponge on the racket, tackiness comes as extra little bonus. Our playing style then different - full body rotation, power from your hips and etc (ask boxer does he hit using hand power or hips and torso power? You might be very surprised ...) Similar mechanics here. If we want to use Chinese classic sponge we do full swing shots to bend that hard sponge and make it work. Tiny wrist/elbow motions are not powerful enough to do that.So 1) if you are not doing any of that or not purposely learning towards these skills and 2) putting Chinese rubbers on your blade because of tackiness cause it helps to spin the ball, take it easy and go for soft sponge but grippy topsheet. Here is an example of such topsheet. Black is zero tacky, while red is lightly tacky but they produce heavy spin even from backhand.\n",

      "Thank you for the tip about using a drop of soap with the water once a week. I will try that and see.I am aware about the link between tack and the hard sponge although my understanding was that, with the Chinese technique, you don't try and engage the sponge fully but go for brush shots with the sponge providing some assistance but never fully compressed. Of course that requires a near-perfect technique and adequate leg/upper body power which most people who are not in the CNT don't have.That being said, you do bring up a good point that maybe tack is overrated as the cause for spin if your technique is not correct.At this time, based on all the feedback, I've decided to stick with my STN and will try the Gambler Burst Thor's Hammer when I decide to change from it.

      "So you're right, blue diamond is the softest sponge they offer. It's not pathetically soft, though. Gearz is barely palpably harder than BD. Thor's Hammer is significantly harder than BD and harder than Gearz by a seemingly larger margin than Gearz to BD. I noticed I had less power with BD on balls-out shots but found I got more spin on everything. Consistency was way better as well and I could attack a much larger percentage of serves and pushes effectively. I also had to put in less effort for just about everything.

      "Epictetus, Thank you for taking the time to respond. While I've been playing only 2 months now, I'm pretty good at looping (so I've been told by other players who are better than me ) and try to use the Chinese style. I feel like the blade/sponge may be leading to bad habits due to the soft sponge and the carbon blade (even though it is rated as ALL). I agree with your assessment that since I'm a novice-intermediate player I may not be able to handle the hard sponge; that is the very concern I have. The only issues that I have with the Zero are that the Zero is not tacky and there are no reviews of the Zero with Blue Diamond sponge. The Burst (w/o Thor's hammer) sponge is, unfortunately, not described on the Zeropong site so I don't know if it is mid hard or soft. My preference would be a mid-hard rubber so I'll have to ask for that information by calling up Zeropong customer service.Regarding the BH, do you think the Mech-Tek 2.1 mm would be a good choice? I have a better backhand than forehand but still trying to become more consistent at looping. My loops, when they cross the net, are pretty good. I don't know if my lack of consistency in looping is due to my technique or a limitation of the Sevens rubber. I also have a good flick that, more often than not, lands on the table and is hard to return. Looking at the description of the Mech-Tek, it states that it is like Tenergy and my concern is that it may be detrimental rather than helpful at this stage. That is why i was looking at the Zero Blue Diamond as a possible replacement BH rubber.I will try to capture video of my play but don't have a tripod for my cell phone so it may not be possible at this time.Any suggestions you can provide will be very much appreciated.Thanks in advance!\n",

I actually bought the Silver Dragon Double Carbon with Sevens rubber for my girlfriend as her first paddle. I played with it for a couple months and it's actually a pretty good setup for beginners and even for intermediate. As it was mentioned, I did find the Sevens rubber to have a low throw angle. Agreeing with others you have to make an adjustment when switching between rubbers/blades. I have 4 setups that I can play with and I'm very comfortable switching among them. The Sevens rubber had a good tackiness to it from new (6.5/10 I was able to hold the ball for about 2 seconds). After a couple months of playing the tackiness is still good (6/10). My current setup is a Xiom Hayabusa ZXi with Super 999T on FH and Mech-Tek Predator on BH. I've tested my friend's Tenergy 80FX so in comparison with Mech-Tek it's similar but Tenergy is much more bouncy and faster. I tried playing the Tenergy on my FH but I didn't like it at all. However, I wouldn't hesitate to play Mech-Tek on my FH, which to me felt a lot better. As for spin I can't comment on Tenergy but Mech-Tek gives plenty. The throw angle on Mech-Tek doesn't seem to be high or low. Just yesterday during a rally I was able to perform a fast backhand loop from under the table and go over the net with about 2-2.5 inches of clearance. Really surprised me as I've never done that. There's much more to the rubber that I haven't seen. In addition, I was very surprised about the tackiness of Mech-Tek when I first got it (5/10). Although now after a couple of months it's lost it.

I will buy the Mech-Tek when it is time to change the current rubbers since my game should have progressed quite a bit by then. The Burst is surprisingly good on the FH and I like it a lot.Thanks again to all for your advice and feedback. It will help me a lot in my TT journey.\"]\n",
      "Interesting finding:I recently tested out Mech-Tek on FH and Super 999T on BH. Surprisingly, I like it a lot. I personally think that Mech-Tek is better on the FH than on BH. Loops were very crisp and beautiful. Smashes and \"plays away from the table\" are amazing. Really gives you the confidence! Short game is very much acceptable. I didn't find a problem with pushes. Flicks are almost effortless. Only downside is that I wish it retained it's tackiness better because serves aren't as spiny when new. And with this setup, I find my BH to have more control with a tackier rubber. Chiquita flicks (banana) feel a lot better than the Mech-Tek as well.\n",

      "Just to complete the Burst review. Played yesterday against partners and my previous comments stand. From the partners' perspective, there was little difference between H3 and Burst/Thor in terms of spin and the famous dip after bounce. I did intentionally close my blade a bit more with the Burst to offset the higher arc but that was the only modification made. Blocks against power loops and slow topspins were about equal. There was one difference re: previous post on serve. The Burst/Thor was as spinny--if not more--than the H3. My serves, however, are graze-thin and, when effective, both rubbers were dangerous on the serve. Considering the higher tackiness on the Burst, this may not be altogether surprising.Conclusion: this is a great H3 alternative. Since the USD price is only $4.50 between them, any preference would be justified by the push/flick difference in your play with the proviso that going from H3 to Burst will require a slight close on blade angle (or more forward stroke).\n",

On pushes the high throw was problematic at first, but in the opposite direction because it's a push, your pushes go into the net.

The Speed is far more on the Burst, so less effort for loops, blocks with more speed, but more care needs to be taken on pushes and chops. The H3 is definitely spinnier on just about everything, particularly on serves, and even more so on short serves.Both chop well, I prefer the H3 because of the lower throw.

Going for a fast rubber but to get a thin sponged one because 'it may be too fast at >1.8mm' doesn't make sense at all, especially not on a spring-sponge or tensor where you want to get the most bang for your buck.Nevertheless, since I can't judge on your backhand-preferences, the Taiji may be an option as a softer chinese type of rubber with below-average weight. There are a lot of players out there who are fine with 729 SuperFX and similar rubbers on their backhand and a more expensive, state-of-the-art rubber would be a waste of money.\n",

      "Iskandar/Red, Thank you for your responses and apologies for not being more clear. I specified that my current rubber was 1.7mm by way of telling you what I was currently using and neglected to specify that I wasn't looking to get a similarly thin sponge. I'm currently looking at those rubbers in the 2.0/2.1mm thickness and, if that isn't available, in Max thickness. I bought my current BH rubber at a time I wasn't too sure whether I would be able to handle a faster rubber and thought a thinner sponge would provide more control. Now, after playing more, I realize my fears were unfounded. I now realize it wouldn't have made too much of a difference.I did find that vendor on AliExpress and also noticed that they only have Max thickness. My question was related to whether I should go for the Taiji (36 degree sponge which is a bit on the soft side) or one of the tensors that I specified. At my current level of play, I don't think I will have any issues but couldn't decide and was hoping someone had some experience with those rubbers to guide me. I'm aware that selecting a rubber is very subjective and there is no \"one size fits all\". I had bought my current paddle at Iskandar's recommendation and am extremely satisfied with that decision. I was hoping to get some insights from people who had used these rubbers that could similarly guide my decision.Thanks again for your valuable inputs!\n",

You do that by, um, boosting the sponge, coming up with the optimal pips arrangement, optimizing the chemical composition of the topsheet, etc. etc. etc. And why use thick sponge? Exactly the same reasons - you want lots of spin and more speed. So to get as much spin and speed as possible, you combine the thick sponge AND all the technology you have. So why use all this technology with thin sponge? You've just thrown away half of what you need to get what you wanted to achieve in the first place. And besides, if you make a Tensor with 1.0mm sponge, it'll be the equivalent of, say, Sriver with 1.3mm sponge. Why bother making the Tensor with 1.0mm sponge to begin with?

      "['Here\\'s why I think such rubbers don\\'t exist. These \"modern rubbers\" are designed to do what? Make lots of spin and generate high speed. You do that by, um, boosting the sponge, coming up with the optimal pips arrangement, optimizing the chemical composition of the topsheet, etc. etc. etc. And why use thick sponge? Exactly the same reasons - you want lots of spin and more speed. So to get as much spin and speed as possible, you combine the thick sponge AND all the technology you have. So why use all this technology with thin sponge? You\\'ve just thrown away half of what you need to get what you wanted to achieve in the first place. And besides, if you make a Tensor with 1.0mm sponge, it\\'ll be the equivalent of, say, Sriver with 1.3mm sponge. Why bother making the Tensor with 1.0mm sponge to begin with?

I like the control for me of chopping wiht thinner sponge. I like the catapult of chopping with tensors. So, I would like to marry the two. I know that chopping with a thin tensor would be faster than Reflectoid, and I'm sure I'd like it if I could find one. Doesn't have to be a tensor per se, but it does need to have a bit of catapult compared to chinese thin sponged rubbers. Need proof of concept? Compare thin sponged classic inverted rubbers at 1.0mm to their dead chinese counterparts. Both are good in their own ways. Or compare P-1R to FL3 to DTECs to Xiom LPO. The FL3 is completely different, slower, and different feeling than Dtecs. Yet there are top players playing with both. Why does Joo like chopping with Tensor LPs?

      "FYI, the 729 large pore is now available in 1mm, so I just ordered it. This is what I am looking for in theory. I may try to boost it. My theory is that there is braking effect and spin control based on the ball bottoming out on chops (an expected bottoming out). However, there is still speed (speed and braking effect not being mutually exclusive) for forward strokes and on chops the faster sponge makes it so one doesn't need to chop forward quite so much. Dtecs being a tensor, speed-wise, I actually like. I don't use it because it was just too slippery for my liking, and I didn't like the resulting throw. But what's nice is, you can just concentrate on the chop, and worry a little less about generating depth. In fact, all you have to think about is dampening the shot with a looser grip if the guy power loops. it can be done even on very fast blades like the JSH (as evidenced by JSH, and Eric Li a local kid out here about 2100).The taller pipped tensors have a feeling of dwell, cushioning, and there is great room for error with regard to dealing with the spin. The speed is what you have to account for more. I like that trade off. This is why I suspect Jo Parker and Satoshi Aida like chopping with tensor-like rubbers. The speed and spin is good, but the dwell gives them some wiggle room with regards to spin. The speed of course, is something you have to account for but this affords more attacking possibilities at various distances from the table.\n",

Same reasons...faster is less effort to generate speed or distance.

Same technical things as looping, but the stroke is going toward the floor instead of going toward the ceiling.

For a direct comparison the AK47 Blue is slightly faster but actually significantly less grip so you are not going to get higher throw from it.

It's not how fast you can hit a ball by someone that will win you matches, it's about strategy and placement that will win you games.

      "If you are talking about me, then I'm 1800 at best . Also, last time we played, you beat me, I think, but that was before you switched to pips...I originally got Baracuda because everyone was raving about its spin, which it has plenty, plus some people said it chops well. I have not really hated anything in particular, still have it an old sheet on one of my blades. It is somewhat sensitive to spin, if I were to pick something. Moved away from it mostly due to exploration and desire to try something else (also Rasant went on sale, IIRC).\n",

      "I know a handful good players that use baracuda both sides or on the forehand and they are all north of 2000 with the highest being 2300. The 2300 (peak was above 2400) player used to play with H3 on his FH, switched to baracuda, and is known for his step around FH power. He is a 2 winged looper from china, coaches, and is a good friend of mine...some on here have played him. He plays with it on a TB ALC. He actually chose baracuda because it was faster than his H3, but slower than his Tenergy. So take that for what it means. He has never played with anything other than Tenergy 05, H3, or Tenergy 64 (typical Chinese junior story from age 6 to now 20).But the reason that \"most\" don't play with alternative rubbers manufacturers is because of Butterfly's very successful marketing strategy, or DHS' dominance of the CNT forehand rubber strategy. Most juniors getting coached by a chinese coach will start with Tenergy and/or Hurricane because that's what they are given. And from there they never give equipment a second thought afterwards, and then they become elite. Likely their club is sponsored by Butterfly, and since Tenergy is the zeitgeist or the rubber paradigm for inverted spinny rubbers most of the players use it simply by default. Essentially what I'm saying is that Baracuda or any Tensor is good enough and has enough speed given the right technique. But, certainly there are a billion tensors out there with more speed, but there will always be trade offs in your game. Speed isn't always \"better\" or caused by the rubber. In fact there are several pros that play with Tenergy FX rubbers at times (Harimoto, Kreanga) and those were fast enough for them, and T05FX is definitely slower than Baracuda IMO.For me, I prefer the Baracuda's slightly slower speed over T05 and MX-P on my new Viscaria...I just bought the blade, but this rubber/blade combo certainly has enough speed for my level (1630). And it seems to be good enough for Bojun (2400).  Perhaps you are far above my level, but just adding some perspectives and observations here.

When trying out different rubbers ( the only way to do it is back-to-back on the same blade) I usually have to stop and think about what I'm experiencing.

My motivation for trying all sorts of rubbers is different from other people's - in most cases it's to verify what someone has written about some rubber or another. In most cases the result has been disappointment - I am pretty sure by now that there isn't any magic rubber that will immediately give me twice the spin or double the speed of whatever I am using at the moment. Not even 10% more, or even 5%. Most rubbers play pretty well, and are usable by most people and they don't affect my game.

At this stage I'm thinking a Sanwei M8 blade with Yasaka Mark V 1.8mm BH and DHS Skyline 3-60 mid-hard – I know this isn't cheap generic Chinese (at best, it's not quite half-way), but it's a step back from my usual soft carbon, two-tensor rig.Personally I think it will be a test of sound technique: the more robust our technique, the better we'll adapt.What do you reckon?\"]\n",

Haven't done any counterlooping drills in a while, though, so I seem to have forgotten how to loop in doubles games the last time I played - don't think it's the fault of the blade. It's particularly good for flips and over-the-table attacks of serve, especially for changing direction (inside out shots). I've got three more M8s - they all turned out to be the newer \"Junior\" M8s rather than the \"red\" M8 which was my first one. Time will tell whether I go back to the N11 in the end, that's what's happened in the past with all the other blades I've bought, but I haven't liked one as much as this.

Backhand: Yinhe 9000 (with red sponge, from a generic 2-pack, which is quite a bit lighter than the \"branded\" sheets with the cream sponge). The blade was very light (about 72 grams) so I went with the Whale (which is heavy - this one wasn't nearly as heavy as the first sheet I tried some months back, though).

Backhand however was quite good and if you had seen it you would have though my backhand was my better side, plenty of spin and loop, I was very impressed.   The forehand just seemed to lack a little something but maybe that something is just a slight adjustment.

What this means is that I should go through the season without being challenged except for one person who beat me last season but I rank 100 pts higher and have won our previous four encounters. The rest of the players are around 250pts below me. Due to that I'm not sure it will really give me a good indication of the results of the experiment but during the season I'll play enough of the regular Div 1 players to know how my results, even in practice, compare.

      "Not sure I understand what you mean. Could you define your terms? I think I understand thin and thick, as we can measure these empirically. Are you talking about sponge thickness? As for fast/slow, that's pretty subjective, and is a function of how you play your strokes, the sponge thickness and type, the topsheet, and also the blade.On the whole, I think that many amateur players generally use equipment that is much \"faster\" than they need. I'll give you a few examples: A strong junior using Tenergy 05 Max on FH & BH on a 7 ply carbon blade. I'd say this is generally a \"fast\" setup. His loops and counterloops are blistering. However, he can't serve short, and he can't touch short. I'm pretty sure his serving and touching technique is good. When he served with my old coach's 5 ply blade, with H3N, his serves were much much better, and his short game was far more controlled. Sure his loops weren't as \"fast\" and he needed to put in more effort, but I thought he played better with the less fast setup.I sometimes play weaker players using my hardbat setup - 2 x Dr Evil on a Tibhar Defence Plus. Now this is probably about the slowest setup I have ever felt. To get the ball full length on a FH or BH drive, I need to exert much more energy than with my usual setup (1.8mm short pips on an OFF blade). However, within about five minutes, my brain/body has corrected its expectations, and I can play the balls short or long, with plenty of control. When I need to hit the ball hard and fast, I can. If there's a weak ball and I smash it, it goes very hard and very fast. This is with no sponge, on one of the slowest blades on the planet. I don't lack penetration - I just need to place the ball well and get the timing right.My team mate is a top division two player. Probably good enough for division one. He has superb control on his FH and BH, and can roll and place the ball accurately. Against even slightly high balls, his FH is explosive, yet accurate. He hits the ball very very hard indeed, with masses of spin, and can hit through most defenders at this level. If you watch him playing, you might think he has a very fast setup indeed. Nope he uses an all wood, ALL+ blade, and 2.0mm Sriver on both sides.What's my point? There's a lot of gibberish spoken about \"fast\" and \"slow\". Clearly there are measurable and experienceable differences, but on the whole an amateur player can do pretty much anything with pretty much any setup. In general, faster setups should probably be eschewed until a player can demonstrate control and mastery of all their strokes with an allround setup.\n",

When he served with my old coach\\'s 5 ply blade, with H3N, his serves were much much better, and his short game was far more controlled. Sure his loops weren\\'t as \"fast\" and he needed to put in more effort, but I thought he played better with the less fast setup.I sometimes play weaker players using my hardbat setup - 2 x Dr Evil on a Tibhar Defence Plus. Now this is probably about the slowest setup I have ever felt. To get the ball full length on a FH or BH drive, I need to exert much more energy than with my usual setup (1.8mm short pips on an OFF blade). However, within about five minutes, my brain/body has corrected its expectations, and I can play the balls short or long, with plenty of control. When I need to hit the ball hard and fast, I can. If there\\'s a weak ball and I smash it, it goes very hard and very fast. This is with no sponge, on one of the slowest blades on the planet. I don\\'t lack penetration - I just need to place the ball well and get the timing right.My team mate is a top division two player. Probably good enough for division one. He has superb control on his FH and BH, and can roll and place the ball accurately. Against even slightly high balls, his FH is explosive, yet accurate. He hits the ball very very hard indeed, with masses of spin, and can hit through most defenders at this level. If you watch him playing, you might think he has a very fast setup indeed. Nope he uses an all wood, ALL+ blade, and 2.0mm Sriver on both sides.What\\'s my point? There\\'s a lot of gibberish spoken about \"fast\" and \"slow\". Clearly there are measurable and experienceable differences, but on the whole an amateur player can do pretty much anything with pretty much any setup. In general, faster setups should probably be eschewed until a player can demonstrate control and mastery of all their strokes with an allround setup.']\n",

      "IMO Speed is less of a consideration as there are a lot of slower thick blades (309 chop, defensive balsa), and plenty of of slower thick rubbers (Reflectoid, tack chop, etc). Also plenty of fast thinner blades (Carbon) and thinner fast-ish rubbers (Yanus, thin Yasaka Mark V HPS, thin, tenergy, thin Vega Asia). The thicker you go with Reflectoid/P-4/Tack chop/FL3, the SLOWER and more dampening they become. To answer the OP's question, it's mostly about feel and preference. Some of the thicker blades just feel different, depending on the type of material they use. It also causes stiffness and the amount vibes are change. Weight could also be a difference, but that largely depends on the type of wood.Thin vs. Thick rubbers. Thickness/Thiness gives you consistency for very specific shots. Thinness on the same rubber usually gives you less grip, and particularly for chopping it makes dealing sidespin loops more managable (this goes for both pips and inverted). Thinner rubbers are also easier to flick with because of the same spin-insensitivity. Generally, the thinner the rubber, the more spin-insensitive it is (always comparing to the same rubber but different thicknesses).Thickness gives you conistency of throw angle when you block/drive/smash, and ensures that you rarely bottom out your rubber which will always (and suddenly) change your throw angle. Thicker rubbers also give more mechanical grip as they tend to envelop the ball and thus more surface area is in contact. So if you wish to generate more spin with your bat movement, thicker is generally how you do it. The feel is also different, so people who have styles that rely on touch and not power so much often prefer thinner rubbers for more feeling. If you are all power all day, thicker is generally the preference.\n",

      "HI ZeroZero, I order equipment at our club for people that sounds just like you. People are often coming from a sport store or Kmart premade bat and looking for the next step. The latest bat I ordered was a Donic Waldner Allplay with LKT Pro XP 2.0mm. All the best I order are similar. Allround blades with allround rubbers. Often I get comments how much faster it is than what they are used to but they soon adjust.So I think something like the above will do you fine. Rubbers don't last forever so with the amount you play, you can replace them in about 12 months with something else if you prefer like a moderate tensor, or pips if that suits your style. I've not had much to do with Butterfly but not aware of a Korbel Allround. I thought it was OFF. There is a Timo Boll All and All+ and also the Primorac OFF- is apparently very good.Apart from that, the Donic Allrounds are good, along with Yasaka Sweden Extra, Xiom Allround S and Stiga Allround Classic / Allround Evolution.There are potentially hundreds of chinese rubbers and there is little difference between them despite the marketing so just grab one and play heaps in the next 12 months and go from there.\n",

This gives maximum benefit to the play in both speed, spin and control. I will agree that thinner rubbers allow this to happen easier however you will find that you quickly bottom thinner sponged rubbers out (especially with softer variants) which is far worse then not utilizing the sponge fully.If you still want to avoid Max and are still playing the double looper style then do the 2.0mm, just don't go getting a very soft rubber.Sent from my HTC One M9 using Tapatalk\n",

      "---I'll explain my perspective before answering your question: I like unboosted Hurricane/Skyline (and similar rubbers unboosted), and I'm familiar with DHS NEO. I'm (recently) familiar with Spin Art, Tackifire C, H3-50, etc.I'll tell you what I like about the former (\"Hurricane/Skyline (and similar rubbers unboosted)\"). At least, this is what I feel in my hands:Every inverted rubber, I guess, has a \"topsheet mode\" and a \"sponge mode\". I think a hard Chinese-style rubber has 1) a strong topsheet mode (it definitely dominates the over the table game, I'm not sure to what extent)2) a gap (some people might say \"doesn't have a low gear\") between the two modes3) strong sponge mode when hit hardTry H2 41d non-NEO unboosted (or PF4, probably) for the ultimate experience of 1-3.Now I'll tell you what I think is \"wrong\" with the latter (\"Spin Art, Tackifire C, H3-50, etc.\"), for me: They are too soft. [Edit: Regrettably, I now add MX-S to this list (as too soft for the above; it is still a great rubber). Edit: ...and OIVA. Edit: ...and OVA.] This permits the sponge to become more involved in the short game, making it harder to drop serves and pushes short, for example. With the former I can brush very hard yet the ball travels slowly. ---Now I'll answer your question \"Why there is no sponge that can give the same performance as traditional chinese hard sponges + booster/glue?\":(Usually), booster/tuning is applied to the blade side of the sponge and then begins leaking, from there, into and through the sponge and then out into the air.So, the boosting/tuning is stronger and remains stronger nearer the blade, and is weaker (and then gets even weaker) on the topsheet side, where the booster/tuner leaks out.If the sponge is hard, and if the topsheet side of the sponge is *relatively* unboosted/untuned, then the gap (as described above) between topsheet mode and sponge mode would be preserved to some extent for the sake of the short game, while a harder hit would engage the more boosted/tuned sponge farther down. If the sponge isn't hard enough this gap is lost.Why doesn't Butterfly make a hard-enough (in this context) Spin Art? Surely Butterfly did try a harder Spin Art. Maybe it had a gap but did not have *this* gradient, deeper down. I.E., if they could have beaten DHS with it - in the field of Chinese-style rubber - they probably would have. So, either they couldn't or something conspiratorial is afoot, eh?Extra credit:I guess that the harder the sponge (and if all else like porosity etc. is equal) then the slower the booster/tuner leaks out. Thus, the differential in the degree of boosting between the top and bottom of the sponge would be greater, accentuating the above.Edit:In contrast, Tackiness Chop [Edit: 1.5mm] is very soft yet has a great short game. Its sponge is always participating in the short game but is so soft that light hits are still slow. This is how both Skyline and Tackiness Chop can work for me, but not most things in the middle. In the context of the above and in comparison to Skyline, I'll think of it this way: Tackiness Chop is like a very deep topsheet. [Edit: In comparison to Skyline, TChop's sponge is so soft that it acts as though the whole thing were just a topsheet.]\n",

I think a hard Chinese-style rubber has 1) a strong topsheet mode (it definitely dominates the over the table game, I\\'m not sure to what extent)2) a gap (some people might say \"doesn\\'t have a low gear\") between the two modes3) strong sponge mode when hit hardTry H2 41d non-NEO unboosted (or PF4, probably) for the ultimate experience of 1-3.Now I\\'ll tell you what I think is \"wrong\" with the latter (\"Spin Art, Tackifire C, H3-50, etc.\"), for me: They are too soft. [Edit: Regrettably, I now add MX-S to this list (as too soft for the above; it is still a great rubber). Edit: ...and OIVA. Edit: ...and OVA.] This permits the sponge to become more involved in the short game, making it harder to drop serves and pushes short, for example. With the former I can brush very hard yet the ball travels slowly. ---Now I\\'ll answer your question \"Why there is no sponge that can give the same performance as traditional chinese hard sponges + booster/glue?\":(Usually), booster/tuning is applied to the blade side of the sponge and then begins leaking, from there, into and through the sponge and then out into the air.So, the boosting/tuning is stronger and remains stronger nearer the blade, and is weaker (and then gets even weaker) on the topsheet side, where the booster/tuner leaks out.If the sponge is hard, and if the topsheet side of the sponge is *relatively* unboosted/untuned, then the gap (as described above) between topsheet mode and sponge mode would be preserved to some extent for the sake of the short game, while a harder hit would engage the more boosted/tuned sponge farther down. If the sponge isn\\'t hard enough this gap is lost.Why doesn\\'t Butterfly make a hard-enough (in this context) Spin Art? Surely Butterfly did try a harder Spin Art. Maybe it had a gap but did not have *this* gradient, deeper down. I.E., if they could have beaten DHS with it - in the field of Chinese-style rubber - they probably would have. So, either they couldn\\'t or something conspiratorial is afoot, eh?Extra credit:I guess that the harder the sponge (and if all else like porosity etc. is equal) then the slower the booster/tuner leaks out. Thus, the differential in the degree of boosting between the top and bottom of the sponge would be greater, accentuating the above.Edit:In contrast, Tackiness Chop [Edit: 1.5mm] is very soft yet has a great short game. Its sponge is always participating in the short game but is so soft that light hits are still slow. This is how both Skyline and Tackiness Chop can work for me, but not most things in the middle. In the context of the above and in comparison to Skyline, I\\'ll think of it this way: Tackiness Chop is like a very deep topsheet. [Edit: In comparison to Skyline, TChop\\'s sponge is so soft that it acts as though the whole thing were just a topsheet.]']\n",

      "Hi Alx. I'm happy to see your reply.I agree! I am not an expert on boosting. I have never boosted and I only used rubber cement in the past, not speed glue.-First, in defence of boosting, they say it also adds spin. *That* is useful in the short game. Someone who has a very good short game and can use this extra spin and still keep the ball short with a boosted rubber would probably want this extra spin. I'm not that good and Hurricane/Skyline is already very spinny.-Next, yes, if boosting softens the sponge and makes it faster it would reduce that \"gap\", and the sponge would begin adding speed to serves and pushes.Hurricane 3 has a good gap. The amount of boosting/tuning in H3NEO is not too much. It is still a great Chinese-style rubber (that's why I included it in the first group, in my previous post). But many people who use a lot more booster/tuner than that do not really like the 1-3 behavior that I described, I think. They say about unboosted H3 that \"it doesn't have a low gear\" or \"on soft hits the ball falls into the net\", and things like that. I think they don't understand that 1-3 model, and they don't actually like it. I loved it even before I had thought it all through, before I realized what was happening. I don't want the extra speed and I don't want the properties of my rubber to change too much as any booster/tuner wears off. It can feel great to play with a more lively rubber! But then it is depressing when the tuning wears off and the setup is more inert again, and I don't want to get involved in that cycle.Also, I just spent a couple of years looking toward a partly defensive style, and I still hope to push and chop with as much control as possible. I looked at rubbers like Tackiness Chop for a while but did want more speed. I think it is very interesting that the rubbers we're talking about can also serve for this.No. But when I play over the net, inside the table, I want to \"cut\" the ball as hard as I can and still drop it short (and I'm not a great player who can do that with a faster rubber). The price I pay is that when I am hitting hard I must work a lot harder. If I were a better player and a lot more of my shots were hard I could imagine welcoming the added speed.\n",

      "Thanks! I differentiate between the two in my head, but I could totally be wrong about how I interpret the two strokes. There is certainly some overlap between them.To me, fishing is done usually with an open bat where the rubber is pointed more toward the ceiling. This is used more with balls that are falling more vertically before making contact with the bat. Example would be when you are chopping at distance and your oppnonent does a soft drop shot and you have to run in and fish the ball near the table. Fishing is done more when out of position. Typically the ball is recieved below the knees.A Guide loop is done when the ball has more topspin and more speed. The bat is more closed and facing the opponent more...from 45 to 80 degrees. The ball is typically recieved above the knees. These balls are sent back with much more pace and much more topspin. Often, modern defenders will add some side spin on these shots to deal with the topspin from the loops. If you watch the Koji Matsushita tutorial video where he is teaching Shiono and someone else (cant remember the name) he shows this shot. I'll look up the video. Gionis and Filus do this as their regular stroke from distance while playing defense, so any video you see of them when they aren't attacking on the FH, 90% of the time the stroke on the FH is what I consider to be a \"Guide Loop.\"\n",

Xiom Musa is a non-tensor ESN rubber, as are Andro Shifter, Joola Zack, Adidas R-Classic. People think of them as modern classics - good spin but without the wide gears and top-end speed of some of the more jumpy and reactive tensors out there.That said, these non-tensor ESNs are still a good option for people who want some of the tensor feel but without that higher-end performance. Musa is a good rubber - solid, dependable, excellent grip, very linear, but heavy and a bit slow. It's a safe starting point for anyone who wants to dip their toe into the ESN water.I should say that some of the recent ESN tensors are much easier to use than past generations. They are generally less bouncy, more linear, more reliable for grip. Even the recent softer-sponge options like Acuda P3 and Rasant Beat aren't overly bouncy, which is a step forward IMO (that said, if you like bouncy rubbers then the old stuff is still available, it's all personal). ESN have generally been excellent for quality control and sheet-to-sheet consistency, and you can get some of the more popular ones for £23-£25 a sheet if you know where to look - half the price of Tenergy in the UK, and not much more than the better Chinese rubbers.The OP mentions that they currently use Whale. While there are tacky tensors, they remain a niche product for ESN and they've never really taken off in the way you might have expected. A lot comes down to individual needs and level, but if you're a Whale user then you might have a brushy FH stroke. From the ESN range, as a brushy FH player myself, I've generally found it easier to use something with a hard sponge/soft topsheet, which allows me to keep my stroke as-is when moving from tacky chinese stuff. The best out there like this at the moment IMO is Omega V Asia, and it works incredibly well with the plastic ball (if that matters to you). It's still fast and very spinny, but solid and predictable. A little sensitive to spin when passive, but so is Whale, and although it's a bit faster than Whale in the short game (no tack to hold the ball up), OVAsia isn't hugely faster than Whale overall. But I'm making some big guesses about the OP here, and I could be very wrong.(as a counter-point, I've always found it hard to use tensors with hard, stiff topsheets on my brushy FH. The original Rhyzm was bad for me on the FH, but excellent in the hands of a more direct power player. So YMMV)And don't worry too much about what you thought about Hexer.

      "Different rubbers suit different game styles, some moreso than others. You can get away with one rubber for a certain style when its more suited to another, but using the right rubber for the right style tends to help. So if you brush loop and rely on spin to generate pace, then a tacky rubber may be best. If you hit through the ball more a grippy rubber will be better. The rubber you use also needs to take into account the blade you use, and all needs to suit your style...although as I said you can get away with a setup that isn't perfectly suited. This phenomena of rubbers and blades and style matching leads to a disease we call EJ-ism. (Equipment Junkie). Or in short, it leads to a lot of expense in buying and trying different combinations of blades and rubber seeking the holy grail of setup. If you can afford it and you find it fun, its a novel exercise. There are hundreds of stories on the forum about people who've gone through similar EJ exercises. It can be valuable experience to gain a lot of firsthand knowledge and may eventually lead to equipment that is better suited.But if you are expecting that \"biting the bullet\" and buying more expensive rubbers will instantly improve your game, listen to Carbonman, the EJ Boogeyman who believes changing equipment is the worst way to improve. Cos he is right, buying more expensive rubbers won't be an \"instant fix\". You may eventually find more expensive rubbers do suit your style better, btw. I went though a fairly long EJ exercise myself and ended up finding the more expensive tensor suited my FH best (compared to cheap chinese rubbers). But I also developed my game along the way through that EJ exercise and worked my way up to the Rasant I now use (and have used for years).I hope this helps guide your decision, although I know I have not provided a definitive answer. A definitive answer as to what rubber suits you best does not exist on a forum though. You have to just collect as much as you can from the forum and use it to help guide your decisions.\n",

I went though a fairly long EJ exercise myself and ended up finding the more expensive tensor suited my FH best (compared to cheap chinese rubbers). But I also developed my game along the way through that EJ exercise and worked my way up to the Rasant I now use (and have used for years).I hope this helps guide your decision, although I know I have not provided a definitive answer. A definitive answer as to what rubber suits you best does not exist on a forum though. You have to just collect as much as you can from the forum and use it to help guide your decisions.']\n",

I haven't played with H3 but it's treated as \"number one\" chinese tacky rubber. If you want go step up- try provincial or national version. Another option- go with Tenergy and modern tensors. But they are not better but different and plays differently. If H3 (and chinese tacky rubbers in general) suits your game- why change?As for Aurora- I like it a lot. It has moderate catapult and grip. If you want a bit more catapult and more grip- try 729 Battle, their prices are very close. If you want to go even more- take a look at modern tensors and Tenergy.

      "No, and here's the reason why. What you're paying for is incremental elasticity improvement, at the tune of maybe 10% per doubling of price towards the high tend. Except this isn't useful, and tends to be detrimental to developing players. 20% more elastic doesn't mean your shots are automatically 20% faster since that also requires greater finnese, but more like 20% less stroke/impact-speed is necessary for the same shot. While this may be helpful for high level players who are reaching the limit for physical stroke execution, it does nothing for most everyone else who if anything use too slow/short/delicate, and negatively impacts developing players who are by definition trying to learn how to hit the ball properly.\n",

It's great stuff despite it's cheap price - better than the retail packaged Emperor Dragon, even. I compared it to Yinhe Apollo III, which costs anywhere from $15 to $20 depending on where you get it. The Dragon's noticeably faster. Pretty subtle, like it usually is, but it's there. This much I agree with, except that when you go from a $5 rubber to a $20 rubber you're probably gaining 5-7% if that. If you go to Hurricane you'll likely be going DOWN in speed, if what people say about it is true. You might get 20% if you go to Tenergy (but that's $80 rubber).

Anyway, have tried both the Moon Pro and Mercury II which I got off the OOAK shop recently. I must say I am impressed with both rubbers. The Moon Pro seems a very lively rubber very much like Tenergy 05, except that its tacky surface does not allow me to do my favourite delicate touch drop shot. The tackiness sort of make the ball drop very short from the blade before the net instead of over the net  I would need to adjust a bit there. But overall, for the price, I am really impressed. As for Mercury II, I must say it is also a very good rubber if one is after a bit more control. Yet, if required, a smash with the rubber brings it to life and it is fast enough to cause my opponent trouble. I particularly like its blocking ability. However, this is based on only a couple of hours hit up recently. Must give it a bit more time. So far, the nice thing is I actually don't miss my Tenergy 05 when I was hitting with the Moon Pro which is quite a feat \n",

The tackiness sort of make the ball drop very short from the blade before the net instead of over the net  I would need to adjust a bit there. But overall, for the price, I am really impressed. As for Mercury II, I must say it is also a very good rubber if one is after a bit more control. Yet, if required, a smash with the rubber brings it to life and it is fast enough to cause my opponent trouble. I particularly like its blocking ability. However, this is based on only a couple of hours hit up recently. Must give it a bit more time. So far, the nice thing is I actually don't miss my Tenergy 05 when I was hitting with the Moon Pro which is quite a feat \"]\n",

The Rasant seemed to stay a bit lower on harder shots, so I'd probably call it a lower throw rubber than JP03 overall, but it's so, so close. I actually preferred Rasant PS for my BH side, but I stuck with JP03 because I can get Donic stuff more reliably and cheaply than Andro. They are so similar that I'd say you know 90% of how JP03 will play.M2 is faster, harder, higher throw, more aggressive than JP03. JP03 is a lot easier to use in the short game - it's not as sensitive to spin, and it's slower there. It just comes down to your needs really.

      "[\"Ah, well there you go then! When I had Rasant PS, I couldn't tell much difference between it and JP03. They felt identical in the short game. The Rasant seemed to stay a bit lower on harder shots, so I'd probably call it a lower throw rubber than JP03 overall, but it's so, so close. I actually preferred Rasant PS for my BH side, but I stuck with JP03 because I can get Donic stuff more reliably and cheaply than Andro. They are so similar that I'd say you know 90% of how JP03 will play.M2 is faster, harder, higher throw, more aggressive than JP03. JP03 is a lot easier to use in the short game - it's not as sensitive to spin, and it's slower there. It just comes down to your needs really.

I can actually pick up the ball with for a short while. I could definitely feel quite a bit of tension in the sheet, even when I bounced the ball of the bat quite softly. I'm not sure that this rubber is actually factory tuned, as there was no residue on the sponge, and there was no glue layer on the back like there is for Apollo / BWII , etc. The good if it's not tuned is that the effect should not fade away, or at least not as fast.Apart from the fairly high tension in the topsheet, it does not really play like a glued up rubber, nor does it have the sound of one. However it is quite a fast, spinny and high performance rubber, and comparing it to T05 is not too far fetched, as it does similarities.Short game - Moon is a little slower, deader and spinnier, partially due to the tacky of the moon. The tacky really only slows down the rubber at very low impact, and it picks up speed fast after that.Serves - Moon is definitely easier to get high spin with, as it serves like a tacky rubber. The lower speed means you can rip it a little harder as well without making it too deep. Slow loops - Moon is slightly slower but very spinny. T05 is faster with similar spin.Power loops - T05 has quite a bit more catapult, and produces a higher arc. Moon has a lower arc and comes off significantly faster. Both are very spinny, but due to the different arcs it was a little hard to work out which was spinnier. T05 has more of the clicky feel that glue gives you. Both produces great kick on sidespin loops.Blocking - Moon is easier to block with, mainly due the lower catapult and less sensitivity to spin when the ball digs in.I found Moon to be more linear, whereas T05 generates more power and spin with less effort. I played quite a few games, and could not make up my mind which I liked better. I do like the glue feel of the T05, but prefer the tacky topsheet and higher speed of the Moon.Comparing it to Thor's, I'd say I still like the Thor's better, as this also has a bit of that Tensor feel and has a higher arc, closer to T05. Grip / tack on Thor's and Moon is similar, perhaps Moon a little more tack.I will try both rubber on another blade, probably the Virtuoso blade, and will do another comparison.NOTE: This is only a prelimiary test...

The sponge (for the red sheet) is red.

The URL states that one is \"Factory Tuned\", the other is \"Max Tense\". Then you go to the product pages, and it turns out they're BOTH Factory Tuned and they're BOTH Max Tense. Grrr.. The only difference I can see is in the pictures - different logos on the free protector sheet, and one of them has that phallic looking gold sticker on it (that says it's factory tuned). And on neither do they state sponge hardness. I've only come across 33 degree sponge on one other (Chinese) rubber - Yasaka ZAP Spin.

      "Thanks! I'm trying. Coaching will be a big help, but the language barrier of the local TT center and the fact that I'm Jpen has me a bit cautious with the $ I invest. I had that on my radar as well! Many of the commenters on the TTDB mentioned the fact that it has a \"Big Window Effect\"...not sure what that means. Is that a way of saying that it gives you a lot of room for error due to the arc? What turned me off to it is the relatively low throw angle rating. It's not much different than the Vega Pro Elite that I have now. Am I wrong in thinking that a higher throw angle results in a greater arc+spin, thus causing the ball to land sooner (And in turn further in from the edge of the table)?Thank you so much for your input! \n",

      "I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control. Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial. Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge. So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before. Technically rated as a tensor and it seems it can be used / or was designed with speed glue in mind. Using normal glue it should be fine. With a sheet costing €18 it might be worth a bash.

Beginners should start 36-38° 1.8 or 2.0mm (lowest speed, more controlled play), but more experienced player who can generate enough speed in hand might like it, too  (especially on BH, and/or on a faster blade).\n",

Evidently, the harder sponge will help keep the trajectory low on the chops. One of the major problems with my forehand chops has been that they go too high nd so are easier to attack.So based on his comment, I then ordered a Globe 999 with 1.8 mm 40 deg sponge and one with 1.5 mm 38 deg sponge, and this morning I found someone that sells it with 1.5 mm 40 deg sponge, so I will get one of those to test as well. Luckily, the Globe 999 and Friendship 729 FX setups are all quite inexpensive, and with rubber only lasting 3 months at most for me, it would be nice if I was able to play better with something that didn't run $40 to $60 per sheet.Luckily I have a robot and twin blades that will help me test, and I think I'll plan to spend a few weeks practicing and playing with each setup, changing only the forehand rubber for each, and at the end do a 200 ball robot test for both topspin and chopping to see how consistently I can get the ball on the table, and use that data to make a choice. With exception of the Dr N Special Defence rubber that is expensive, if I get 2 week's use out of each one, it will actually cost less per week than I currently spend replacing each rubber after 3 months because of the per sheet cost differential. In the meantime, I'll do the same consistency test with the rubbers I've been playing with so that I have good benchmarks from which to compare.I also found someone that chops with the LKT Pro XT on FH. It appears they thought it had a little better control than the Globe 999, but it was also a little slower.

      "Hard thin blades want hard rubber and soft thick blades want soft rubber. It all changes around a bit depending on what type of blade exactly but that is a safe bet. Traditional hard tacky Chinese rubber work best on a hard feel highly flexible blades, that there is no arguing about. Think large heads, 5.2-5.7mm thick with a fairly hard top ply, anything between black limba and walnut. The second ply of medium hardness (say eg. White Limba) is the best as far my personal preference goes. The most important thing with Chinese rubber is that you need the blade to be your spring, to be your sponge. These are the best type of blade for an all round game and long distance play. When you add Spruce to the second ply instead of something like Limba you get a pronounced bounce from the second ply, these blades don't spring as hard from the flex as the same blade which has Limba but rebound more from the wood itself, it's a big difference in feel, I prefer the kick coming from the blade flexing rather than the wood bouncing. If you are using this type of flexible blade you need to have rubbers on both sides with decent weight in them otherwise the blade wont work. The length of the head until the handle is one of the more important things with these blades, you want to be sure it's over 159mm, all good thin looping blades including classical Stigas are around 160-161mm.On non flexible yet soft 7 ply blades like a clipper, hard rubbers are a disaster because the blade can't give you the extra power those rubbers need, the throw is also too low and it's just rubbish. These blades do much better and are more well rounded with soft bouncy rubber. A good combination for close to the table out to mid range hitting.Balsa cored blades are another thing all together because you do get bounce from core of the blade which brings a Chinese rubber to life and sometimes you even get some rebound from the flex, not as much as a solid wood but some. The dwell and spring from a balsa blade can make Chinese rubber work really well close to the table, even better than a flexible solid cored blade. The only problem with balsa cores is that you struggle for power away from the table, here you just need to think about how far from the table you need to play, if your at a level where you don't go back more than a couple meters in general offensive play then a balsa core will be ok, maybe even the best choice. Average club players tend to love balsa cored blades the most. It's an easy way to get the most from cheap Chinese rubber but remember these blades don't have the range or adjusting throw angle you need to successfully play far from the table, you wont see many inverted high level players use them for that reason. Of course you can do anything you want and can use a soft rubber on the hard blade and vice versa, I'm just saying that is a compromise and the combination will be fighting each other and never work properly, you want the combination to make playing the game easy. not make it harder. \n",
      "[\"Hard thin blades want hard rubber and soft thick blades want soft rubber. It all changes around a bit depending on what type of blade exactly but that is a safe bet. Traditional hard tacky Chinese rubber work best on a hard feel highly flexible blades, that there is no arguing about. Think large heads, 5.2-5.7mm thick with a fairly hard top ply, anything between black limba and walnut. The second ply of medium hardness (say eg. White Limba) is the best as far my personal preference goes. The most important thing with Chinese rubber is that you need the blade to be your spring, to be your sponge. These are the best type of blade for an all round game and long distance play.

I realized I had a 9000 3 star 2 laying that was almost brand new. I bought it probably 5 years ago when I first started playing and it was way to fast/sensitive for me at the time so I only used it for probably 3 days and its been in storage ever since.I slapped it on my wavestone (probably not the best blade for it... but what the hey). I've been playing with cj8000 biotech on a k4..... so thats whats most familiar and thats my reference point at the moment.I didn't spend to much time with it, but against the robot:- Top spin seemed to have plenty of spin and would dip faster than cj8000. It was easier to hit the table when really wack'n the ball.- It was pretty quick on the wavestone... too quick for my taste, especially when trying to do slow pushes with lots of backspin... Probably a mix of it being so tacky and fast.- Looping heavy backspin was cake (very easy). Way way easier than with cj8000. I guess I forgot how easy it can be sometimes... crazy stuff.I didn't spend much time with it but I thought I would do a quick post just for fun.

      "I played the last tournament with Rasant on my backhand, ultimately it's too fast for me but it makes a lot of spin with the speed and has enough grip to do just about anything you want against serve, if you have the confidence to use it how it want's to be used and that's something very important with this rubber. I use a tacky rubber on the forehand and prefer that over any Tensor or T05. Rasant is not especially good for my forehand stroke just like T05 isn't especially good. I just find Rasant \"less not good\" .I also perceive it makes more spin than T05 when playing against them. That could be just because I'm so used to playing against T05.. then again I see balls coming off Rasant do some very strange things at times on the bounce that I haven't seen happen since speed glued 38mm balls so I'm sure it's making a lot of spin.One thing is that Rasant is harder to control than T05 because it's bouncier and faster, Bluefire is just slightly different to Rasant, not different enough to write the story twice \n",

      "Red, having used T64 only briefly before, and having used T05 somewhat more, I think Rasant carries the best of both worlds of those rubbers. Its a beast in being able to spin up the ball in Tenergy fashion, but remains fast when hitting with less spin and more slap...more along the T64 line, less along the T05 line (I found T05 to be quite slow when slapping). I have switched to Rasant from Hexer Plus on my main setup simply because I like the feel of Rasant more and I get more spin from it in almost every situation...and more speed. Its not a huge difference to Hexer Plus in feel, and I feel they are almost interchangeable for me, but Rasant just feels slightly more polished somehow. I haven't used T64 enough to compare them point for point, but I don't think Rasant loses out to it in any way from what I recall of T64 (it has been a while).\n",

I like the T05fx a lot, so I should be able to see what the feel difference is between the 3 and give a comparison from a tenergy users perspective. I'm looking for a replacement for the Joola Express Two I have on my BH, as I dont like the feel of it, not enough touch and dwell for me compared to the T05fx when I swap between the two for testing, it also feels less spinny on the loops or serves. So what ever the better rubber is, bluefire or rasant, I'll migrate to that one for my BH... Alternatively I could just buy another sheet of T05fx, but this is more fun... and educational.

      "I did get a hit with the Rasant the other month and it felt good, I didn't get the Blue fire as when I ordered them the rubbers where lost in post so when I got my money back from the seller I got a fully bty set up as in my sig I got a sheet as a tester from someone else at the club as they didnt like it.The Rasant I used was pretty fast, at least 2.1m sponge when I measured it with the ruler. It felt springy and was more difficult to play on the short game then T64, as the ball seemed to ping off the rubber quicker, I dont know if its the tension effect on the topsheet or something different. When you can engage the sponge by hitting harder strokes it felt similar to T64, fast, spinny... Though I still found the T64 easier on the short game. Again both are fast rubbers so I'm unsure what the difference is with the Rasant to make it more difficult playing the same short strokes, the Rasant does feel faster on the TB-ALC. Serving I found did not have too much of a difference, maybe a little less spin, but not really much to make a huge difference. Playing back from the table the two rubbers feel much the same on the strokes, with the Rasant seeming to have a flatter trajectory of the bat and a little less topspin on the ball.It really depends of your game, I think that if people are topspinning the ball heavily, the better rubbers would be the T05 or T64 compared to the Rasant. The Rasant is feels more suited for a counter hitting and flat driving/hitting sort of game to me. It may suit some punch backhand players as well where the speed is likely going to be more of an advantage, or maybe even suit some backhands of players. Over all I found the Rasant a little less forgiving on stroke play, but I think with more time to adjust and get used to the rubber it would be a fine rubber in its own right.\n",

      "I play against Rasant pretty much every time I play so I'm getting quite used to what it can and can't do. It's very good at lifting heavy backspin and doing it easily, it suits guys that can use the extreme bounce of the rubber to make heavy spin with that bounce, not to go forward, but to make spin with the bounce in diagonals out of the sponge. Guys that don't hit the ball at 50,000 miles per hour or depend on the blade for spin but rather work with the sponge to get spin. Good level players that don't hit hard, who can control it, that's who it works well for.I still like the feel of Rasant more than T05, T05 always feels somehow \"mushy\" to me. Then again I can't really control either  unless I use them on the forehand and I'm not going to do that.\n",

      "I have used BF M2 for a week or so after several years of T05. (I bought this in a shop in Cologne Germany that is owned by Jorg Rosskopf's brother!) Mine is red, max thickness on forehand. The bottom line is that M2 is the first \" T05 alternative\" I have tried that is acceptable, this after 4+ years with T05 and after spending way too much money on alternatives that I ripped off my blade in disgust, sometimes after just five minutes of play (see below). M2 doesn't feel exactly like T05. It is a touch slower, and the ball feels different. Not worse, just different. It is an excellent feel, though. Some people have described it as more \"liquid\" and that is about right, as if the top sheet is more pliant. The thing is, if you are used to T05, you can play exactly the same way, and play just as well without having to make many adjustments at all. You can get the same high arc spins, you can use pretty much the same racket angles. I have not found that to be the case with any of the \"alternatives\" that have been touted over the last several years. If I had to cite differences, I would be that M2 does not feel quite as nice as T05 on blocks (although I certainly made the shot just as well), and it really shines on opening loops against underspin, or counterloops. It could be that M1 would be better in that regard, I haven't tried it yet.It has a very strong smell -- exactly the same smell as the Dandoy Bio Boost and the Tibhar booster -- and there is no doubt that it comes heavily factory-tuned. Some people have said that they actually like it better after some of that tuning wears off. I will report later how that goes. But if performance declines, well I will know how to bring it back.Rasant is not one of the alternatives I've tried, so I can't compare. But I have tried Hexer, Rhyzm, Vega, Baracuda, Acuda S1, Genius, Adidas P7, and a bunch of others that I can't remember just now, along with a bunch of tensors from the days before I used Tenergy. (Back in the day I used Bryce very heavily speed glued). Among the non-tensors, Calibra LT was not a terrible rubber, but too fast for my liking. Some of the Boost series felt ok, but I didn't feel like my shots had much penetration. None of these rubbers could really be described as a Tenergy alternative for people who really like Tenergy.\n",

It's medium-fast, medium sponge, medium-low throw, not bouncy, impervious to humidity, resistant to chipping around the edges, and great control for its speed. THe HPB seems to work on any blade I put it on. I recently talked one my club's 2000-level players (1st division at our club) into using the HPB and he put it on both sides of a Xiom Zetro Quad OFF+ blade. He said it gave him better touch and his loops are killers. With T05 he was sending too many shots off the table and he was holding back. He doesn't have to hold back now and his power is effective again. I practice block for him and with this new combo I find it really hard to block more than four in a row. I love Nittaku because their products are of such high quality and the HPB rubbers only cost about US$40. It's a great rubber for any level. \n",

      "Here's a bit of history about red and black rubbers for all the younger members here...I was asked a couple of weeks ago by George Downing (current England Junior Number 2) why all of us older players use red on the forehand side and black on the backhand side, whereas all the younger players use red on the backhand and black on the forehand.I explained to him that it was because of what happened in 1986.When the two-colour rule came into force on 1 July 1986, the new black rubbers were much slower than the traditional red rubbers, so players put them on their backhand side.At that time, players predominately used forehand strokes and the backhand was mainly used only as a controlling stroke. So it made sense to use the black rubber on the backhand.Of course, since then, the game has moved on and the backhand is used much more by the top players now, and the difference between red and black rubbers is no where near as much as in 1986.But if you're an older player, you tend to stick with what's familiar.

      "I got my pawz on a free sheet of the very hard-sponged Tibhar Evolution MP-X a week or two back. Forutunately for me, I have been playing with the Uber-hard sponged Tibhar Aurus on FH for a year, so this hard sponged rubber is not much a change to operate for me. I slapped it on my TBS when I immediately went to Bucheon Ace TTC right after my Nexy HQ visit to give it a test. I played some matches with the club locals and a short summary would be that Evolution MP-X plays like a tenergized version of Aurus. There is a bit more pace, a bit more spin, and a little more feel. It plays a bit softer than Aurus, but i doubt the sponge is any softer. The rubber did everything Aurus does with more feel and speed/spin. Played pretty close to T64, even the sponge looked a lot like T64 sponge. my sheet was Red max sponge MP-X cut and water-glued to a different taller Nexy balde tested previously by nexy prez Moon for a session. I water-glued to the TBS and cut off the excess at the top. Noce looking rubber and HARD sponge, which I really like on FH wing. What is differnt on this rubber is the pimple geometry. if you look at it, the nipples are thinner and wider spaced in a different pattern as well. The result is more dwell and feel, plus that awesome sponge transmits the power and spin.I made a vid goofing of in a casual doubles match over there at Ace club in Bucheon.

But as a Donic big slam user ( as well as F3) the tensor is like they said more used for spinning and adding speed to the rubber performance.

I also looked at Desto F3 Big Slam, but its spin ratings are lower than the Vario and Barracuda versions. Yesterday I played for a few hours with used sheets of the Yasaka Pryde 30 and the Donic Vario Big Slam on my Defence II blades, and I was able to play well with both. I've been thinking it through, and the deep, long distance, forehand chop would be nice to have, but the critical chop for me is the one up near the table against serves, pushes, and first topspin attempts before the big attack starts. I have to get those back low, spinny, and oddly placed so they are hard to attack, else I get looped or smashed at.I had a problem with the Vario (and the Pryde, too, I think, because the speeds were similar), though. My practice partner liked it, but maybe part of the reason why was because he was able to block back my drives and smashes with a high degree of consistency, and I had to smack the ball a bunch of times on each point, and eventually to an odd place on the table, to actually get the point. That assumes I didn't miss in the meantime. With the Narucross its very rare they get blocked back. Although it would make practicing a lot more fun, it would cost me a lot of points, games and matches if my drives and smashes were easily returned. Being a defender with a slow defensive blade is tough enough without the drives and smashes coming back, too.Therefore, I'm thinking of going with the Narucross GS Super Soft with the thinner sponge, and just try my best to learn to chop with it as best I can, and try to learn its limits, chopping wise, and learn to attack what can't easily be chopped. It means getting my reflexes to switch to attack more, which is a big change for me.PS: I noticed you have Tenergy 05 FX 1.7. Do you chop with it? I haven't seen that for sale and I didn't have good luck trying to chop with the 1.9 or 2.1 versions.

I had trouble with it way back when I bought my Butterfly Secretin-K in 1975 and that was the first inverted rubber I put on it. Mark V was the second, and I couldn't hit the table with it, either. It was quite an adjustment going from chopping with sandpaper to inverted rubber, LOL.FYI, what I did to \"test\" these different rubbers was to put each on my Butterfly Defence II blade, and hit vs my robot, all at one speed as fast as I could set it and still hit the table, direct it to my FH, and try chopping back 20 balls, and hitting back another 20. The Yanus 2.0 was similar to the Vario Big Slam Max at chopping, but didn't seem to hit as fast when I was driving/smashing them back, if I recall correctly. Of course that was a very seat of the pants subjective test in terms of speed, but the idea was that if it was too slow when I was smashing it, people would be able to return it more easily. The chop part of the test was whether I could chop it back low reliably. On both the chopping and hitting I noted whether I had problems hitting the table or not, and only the faster rubbers had trouble there when chopping, the Narucross doing the best of the faster bunch probably because I'm currently most used to it.I did go look at Butterfly's site and found a comparison chart, and it looks like to get loads of spin, if Tackfire C isn't fast enough, then SpinArt is the next faster of the soft ones before the Tenergy 05 FX. I know someone that uses Spinart, but I don't see him often.http://www.butterflyonline.com/template ... ations.pdfPS: I tried them all again, and added Stiga Magna TC II, hitting about 80 balls for each. The Yanus and Vario still seem slowest smashing, and wouldn't scare anyone, but were the best at chopping. The Narucross GS Soft with 2.1 sponge was the fastest and highest percentage smashing it, followed by the 1.9 version and the sound and speed for them was frightening. The chops weren't as short with them, though, but the percentage wasn't terrible, about 10% less than the Vario or Yanus.

      "Actually, I tried H2 and H3 on my FH last summer, and they worked as far as being able to smack the ball, but I had trouble returning serves with them because I'm not great at reading the spin on them. That's a lot of the reason the Palio and then Donic FH rubber worked so well for me. The Nittaku rubber is only a little tacky, just enough that I can catch the ball to get lots of spin, but not so much as to cause big problems returning serves.In the 2 matches last night, the tougher opponent (1700's) kept me down to a total of about 1 or 2 smashes per game this time. He works very hard at keeping it away from my FH, but that means he has to deal with my chop and pips smash from the BH, and he still lost 3 or 4 points a game on not getting my serves back, and the few smashes I did get were 3rd balls. I have what I'd call a \"low smash\" shot that I use where I move my body first, then my arm like a whip, that I use for any ball to my FH over about 8\" high, and it goes like a bullet with a big crack sound down into their BH. I've only had it blocked back a few times. I've only beaten the guy 3 times now in a year, and that was the second time I did it with the 2.1 Narucross GS Soft. My FH chops and pushes weren't as low and reliable as I want them to be, but he wasn't able to convert too many of those into points, and I came from behind to squeak by 3-2. The second opponent beat me 3-1 when I played him 2 weeks ago using the 1.9 Narucross GS Soft, but this time with the 2.1 I was just creaming him for 3 or 4 points a game with the smashes and low smashes (many 3rd ball), as well as another 3 or 4 mostly on the spinny FH serves. I won 3-0 two matches in a row that way, and the margins got larger as I got used to hitting with the 2.1. Oddly, he did well hitting back the pips, so I mostly chopped with them, forcing him to loop or push.\n",
      "['Actually, I tried H2 and H3 on my FH last summer, and they worked as far as being able to smack the ball, but I had trouble returning serves with them because I\\'m not great at reading the spin on them.

      "Its been quite a while. I was able to adapt to the Nittaku Narucross GS Supersoft 1.9, and I do quite well pushing, chopping and serving with it, and am even able to generate a weak loop attack, now with it. But when I play people that are a lot better than me (ie 1900 to 2000), it seems even if I hit every shot with everything I have (I guess these are smashes), I have real trouble hitting a ball by them, and find myself smashing 5 or 6 times in a row in a rally, alternating locations, and they still send everything back, until eventually I miss off the side or back, or throw it into the net. Yes, I win some points with them, but so many come back that the match exhausts me, and I get demoralized losing the point after all that effort and so many of what I'd consider good shots, LOL. And its not like I can push and chop against these people. They eat those shots up, it seems, so I'm forced to attack instead.Against the 1600 and under crowd, the same rubber and tactics do fine, and rallies rarely need more than 3 or 4 good smashes to end the point.The funny/sad thing is that it reminds me a lot of me beating the 1200 level people 11-0 or 11-1. Its that same differential in ability, it seems, between me and the 1900 or 2000 people. The 1200 player hits the ball as hard as they can, this way and that, and I return everything, till they miss, point after point, game after game, till they get real frustrated. But the shoe is on the other foot here, with ME getting the short end of the stick.So, what to do? the Soft version with 1.9 wasn't real good at smashing, either, as I recall, and when I play with the Soft version with 2.1, I can't push and chop as well, and THAT costs me LOTS of points when my pushes and chops don't land.Anyway, I'm going to try Donic Barracuda Big Slam 1.8 or 2.0. Its supposed to have a 39 deg sponge, and supposed to make a nice crack sound, like the Soft Narucross, I hope. Maybe one of those will be able to both hit and chop... I'm playing 7 days a week, probably 15 or 20 hrs, and much of that is practicing hitting and chopping. Hopefully I can find a way to hit a lot harder, or switching gear again will get me there... Any thoughts or suggestions? I wish I had the recent losses taped to analyze. I think I was playing well, but just wasn't able to convert it to enough points or games.\n",

      "Your blade and rubber is more than fast and powerful enough to hit past your 2000-level opponents. Defence II is like a rocket to me... If I attack with it I could hit past most 2300-level players with ease. I think you should work on getting more solid contact with the ball to transfer power more efficiently. Hit through the ball instead of spinning the ball even when you are loopdriving. The sensation in your hand should be the ball going back at your opponent at a much faster pace than simply looping. Also, you should feel that your entire body weight is pushing the ball back at a rapid rate. Many 1500-1700 level players I have coached are scared of this faster pace (in fact scared of losing \"control\"), so they could never get a solid contact with the ball. Your current equipment is fine. Please take some time and watch some world-class players (such as current world champion Zhang Jike or Wang Hao) on Youtube, and see how they smoothly transfer energy to the ball.\n",

There were also some men and women pros that used Tackifire Drive, e.g., Joo Se-Hyuk, Kim Kyung-Ah. However, as far as I am aware, none of the present-day professional defenders use these rubbers. Instead, they mostly seem to use tenergy. I recently resumed playing table tennis after being away from the sport for 25years, so I don't know what happened? As indicated by justas, has the quality of the rubber improved so much recently? Or, is it related to the speed glue ban and the subsequent requirement of water-based glues?

Perhaps, this is why Tackiness C, which is already slow, is no longer sold in 1.1 and 1.3 mm here in the US.) On the other perhaps my question about the pros is some sense not relevant for most defenders, if there are some defenders nowadays with ratings in the USATT 2300-2600 range that do use Tackiness C.

After a year they were not very grippy at all, and I gave him a new bat of mine (can't recall the setup - globe999 maybe) that left it for dead at that point.\"]\n",
      "Dawei XP 2008 Super Power lasts as much as most rubbers. I have used it on BH wing for over 2 years on my main bat and on a number of other bats. It will last 4-6 months of playing daily for 3-4 hours. As with any rubber, it can slowly oxidize on surface. Cleaning with some lemon juice/olive oli restores ANY topsheet to near original state. You wont need the olive oil until 3 month mark and then maybe once a month. As a contrast, many modern rubber do not last me near as long. tenergy is a very average rubber after a month or two. Most other rubbers do not last more than 2 months on my FH playing every day. I am a very FH happy kinda playing dude, but still, XP 2008 would outlast over half the stuff I use on FH.Now 999, that is one bullt-proof topsheet. You clean that sucker with lemon juice/olive oil every now and then and it can last one long time, like over a year of daily play. You will destroy your sponge beofre you destroy the topsheet.\n",

      "I've used a couple 37 blacks, no durability issues for me. Maybe you got a bad batch or something? DHS rubbers on stiff blades are very difficult to use, the dwell time is too small, so you tend to brush more than usual to control it resulting in the slower apparent speed. That's my hypothesis anyway! The Mercury II is definitely bouncier, and when new it's tackier too. However, both rubbers lose their tack pretty quickly, the H3Neo loses it in a week and the Mercury II in about 2 months. Doesn't really matter though as long as you use adhesive rubber covers as they'll restore the tack.The bottom line is that the H3Neo plays like a traditional Chinese rubber, while the Mercury II plays like an Eurojap rubber with a lot of tack. In other words, other than the tackiness, and I suppose a similar throw, the two really have nothing in common.Note that I've used 3 sheets of retail H3Neo, 1 commercial(ttnpp) at roughly 41 degrees, 1 provincial 40 degrees(ttnpp), 1 provincial 39 degrees(prott.cc), all black at 2.15mm. The 40 degree one and the commercial one played almost exactly alike, other than of course one being a bit softer. This is despite the commercial one measuring at 51 grams while the 40 degree provincial one was only 43 grams. The 39 degree one, however, was a completely different animal. First, it came out of the package with a TREMENDOUS reverse dome. The rubber would literally roll up on itself, with ends overlapping, while the other two would lie almost flat. It was a real pain in the neck to glue and especially reglue, BTW. Its weight was in between, at about 48 grams. Perhaps due to the reverse dome and the softer sponge, it feels to have much better dwell and spin than the other two, while being a bit slower. The differences are pretty noticeable, which is a bit surprising since the difference between the other two were barely detectable. The moral of the story I suppose is that different batches of H3Neo could play differently, even between provincial versions!\n",

Other non-Chinese rubbers that can produce roughly the same amount of spin as T05 in serves and pushes are Calibra LT, Acuda S1, Stiga Boost TP and Yasaka Rakza 7... Maybe T05 could push heavier than these, but I do not feel it from Zaman M. or Justin N...
