133,133,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,To my eyes the rhyzer had more spin with harder/medium strokes and a more linear arc (but still safe arc to go over the net consistently) compared to the 05 & rhyzm -P.

1300,1300,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,For a direct comparison the AK47 Blue is slightly faster but actually significantly less grip so you are not going to get higher throw from it.,2

1851,1851,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thicker rubbers also give more mechanical grip as they tend to envelop the ball and thus more surface area is in contact.,-2

2963,2963,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,Rasant Power Grip is meant to be a hard sponge if I remember correctly so would not suit you if you like medium-soft sponge.,3

3005,3005,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I guess my game could be described as close to the table counter attack where I use my pips to block and set up the ball.,-2

3137,3137,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Last night i had a chance to test the Sun and the Moon pro version.,-2
3138,3138,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I think the red sponge on the Sun is better than the pink sponge from the Moon pro version.,-2
3139,3139,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The Red sponge has more power bouncier.,-2
3140,3140,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,These rubbers could be the right replacement for tenergy series.,-2
3141,3141,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"haggisv, are there any other rubbers that this feels closer to than T05?",-2
3142,3142,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"ie, is it more like, say, other Galaxy rubbers?",-2
3143,3143,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Does it have that typical galaxy feel?,-2
3144,3144,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,In that case I'd like to know why the orange sponge is cheaper  Maybe the Pro versions doesn't give it's power as easily as the normal version?,-2
3145,3145,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"It does not have the feel of a glue effect rubber, apart from the tension in the topsheet.",-2

3149,3149,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Perhaps this rubber works better on softer blades with some flex.,-2
3150,3150,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,If I understand it correctly you say T05 has more catapult than Moon Pro.,-2
3151,3151,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I translate catapult into easy accessible power.,-2

3153,3153,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Could you enlighten me here?,-2
3154,3154,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"With the T05 you feel the ball sink in and then kick out, particulartly at medium speed.",-2

3160,3160,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"so, you are saying in other words that it has shorter dwell time, kicking the ball out more quickly?is it springy feel?",-2
3161,3161,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I would not say lower dwell time, as I can feel the ball dig in, but it definitely feels less springy.",-2

3167,3167,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,the time from when ball digs in till the moment it is kicked out is dwell.,-2
3168,3168,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"catapult effect is when we feel ball is long in sponge, yet when it is kicked out it is surprisingly fast, not expected considering how long it dwelled in sponge.",-2
3169,3169,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"with classic sponge you can expect either if ball stayed about same time in sponge to be much slower when it leaves rubber, or if the speed is similar then the dwell time was shorter.",-2

3176,3176,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,One question.,-2
3177,3177,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Do all these Moon Pro, Sun, etc rubbers with this 'max tense' technology curl a bit when you remove from the package or do they lay flat?",-2

3179,3179,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,They lay pretty flat,-2

3183,3183,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,any difference between black and red,-2

3186,3186,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,That would be Galaxy Apollo vs Red Diamond.,-2
3187,3187,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Apollo would hands down in looping and counterlooping.,-2
3188,3188,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Red Diamond would win in blocking and in anything a player values association in playing with a brick like feel.,-2
3189,3189,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,lolWhen i tried both I'd have put them the other way around.,-2
3190,3190,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Apollo felt like a brick to me.,-2

3192,3192,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,:p I didn't think that would be even half as good as RD.,-2
3193,3193,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I was thinking more about these new rubbers moon/sun etc would be good enough to compare,-2

3196,3196,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I am wondering about the difference of a lot of rubbers.,-2
3197,3197,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I have many sheets of RD and one is very different than the others.,-2
3198,3198,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,All of them are pretty fast though.,-2
3199,3199,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The reviews of many kinds of rubbers by good players leads me to think there is a lot of difference between rubber batches.,-2
3200,3200,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"RD feels in terms of hard feel, more less identical to blue whale in 39 degree for me, so kinda hard... but not really.",-2
3201,3201,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Lets say crisp?, certainly not ""too hard"" at least for me",-2
3202,3202,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,My RD felt a lot better on a medium fast all wood blade than it did on a harder/faster carbon blade.,-2
3203,3203,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Definitely felt brick like on the faster/harder blade.,-2

3209,3209,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I don't think the Pro version is necessarily better... it's just different.,-2
3210,3210,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,well i may order i though after i try the normal version...,-2
3211,3211,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Red Apollo had almost T05 like spin.,-2

3318,3318,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,For someone who has had little or no coaching you seem to be putting the effort into looking at how to improve.If you're dissatisfied with your FH rubber (I've no experience of jpen) you could consider sticking with the same rubber in a not so soft version - the Vega Europe.The Baracuda I wouldn't recommend - it's essentially an old rubber but for the Spin & Speed it gives it's not great on control.Genius Sound I know nothing about but it's rated at 37.5 degree compared to the 42.5 degree of the Baracuda.,-1
3319,3319,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Genius Sound is supposedly a very good rubber but a more up to date version of it would the 5Q sound at the same 37.5 degree.Haven't tried the 5Q sound but the 5Q is a super rubber but imagine it would be too advanced for you at this stage but it can work well for Shakehanders on both sides depending on the blade.There's also the Joola Maxxx 400 which I haven't tried.Safe option.,-1

3329,3329,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Is that a way of saying that it gives you a lot of room for error due to the arc?,-1
3330,3330,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,What turned me off to it is the relatively low throw angle rating.,-1
3331,3331,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,It's not much different than the Vega Pro Elite that I have now.,-1
3332,3332,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,"Am I wrong in thinking that a higher throw angle results in a greater arc+spin, thus causing the ball to land sooner (And in turn further in from the edge of the table)?Thank you so much for your input!",-1
3333,3333,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control.,-1
3334,3334,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial.,-1
3335,3335,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge.,-1
3336,3336,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before.,-1
3337,3337,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Technically rated as a tensor and it seems it can be used / or was designed with speed glue in mind.,-1
3338,3338,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Using normal glue it should be fine.,-1
3339,3339,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,With a sheet costing €18 it might be worth a bash.,-1
3340,3340,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Could opt for a 2.0 This would be more lively than Vega Elite & Vega Europe.,-1

4261,4261,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"So it made sense to use the black rubber on the backhand.Of course, since then, the game has moved on and the backhand is used much more by the top players now, and the difference between red and black rubbers is no where near as much as in 1986.But if you're an older player, you tend to stick with what's familiar.",-1

4654,4654,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Maybe it is just a touch issue with you and you have to practice more short-pushing etc and gain some more experience (??).,-1
4655,4655,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I think Calibra and Rasant would be bouncier than Roxon in the short game department.,-1
4656,4656,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I don't think Rasant is necessarily better than Roxon - it's just different.,-1
4657,4657,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,If you are still at a stage where rubber affects your short-game then I would just stick with Roxon.,-1

4659,4659,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Tensors are generally bouncier than older rubbet types.,-1
4660,4660,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,No problem - it's tricky talking about rubber sometimes when you don't know where the other person is at (hence my use of question marks).,-1
4661,4661,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,You are correct that tensors are generally bouncier than the old staples but I think it is just something you learn to adjust to after a short while.,-1
4662,4662,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,From memory Roxon is somewhere in between Mark V and Rasant/T05.,-1

4700,4700,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The main problem I had with Calibra Sound was the relative lack of spin.,-1
4701,4701,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It's more difficult to get heavy topspin and as a result one gets less dip and the plane of the loop is flatter.I have played with Rasant for 10 minutes or so.,-1
4702,4702,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,IMO it is a different type of rubber than Calibra Sound.,-1

4974,4974,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Im still going with the same setup.,-1
4975,4975,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I know you will stay with the DTECS on the BH.. will hit with you soon.,-1
4976,4976,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Multi ball training next month after I get some more balls From TGPeace GIG,-1
4977,4977,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,This is interesting:)I'm going to give a full review but here are my initial impressions of the rubber.It is not nearly as hard as it is advertised to be.,-1
4978,4978,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It seems chinese when you look at the packaging.,-1
4979,4979,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Then you open it and take it out.,-1
4980,4980,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's tacky but only a little.,-1
4981,4981,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's got a pink ""factory tuned"" sponge and is quite nice looking against a black topsheet.",-1
4982,4982,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I had a short hit with the robot.,-1
4983,4983,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's spinney, and pretty fast.",-1
4984,4984,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"A little slower than tenergy, but a robot can't help me determine that.",-1
4985,4985,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I can say the top sheet feels like tenergy...maybe slightly more tacky, and the sponge has to be around the 37 degree butterfly mark.",-1
4986,4986,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It loops well off of the robot.,-1
4987,4987,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I hit about 100 balls and missed about 10-12, all off the end cause I was trying to see how high and low I could loop to determine the throw angle.",-1
4988,4988,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I'd say it's medium, but I also need a training session to determine that.I noticed chen weixing was using a rubber with a similar sponge in another tread on this forum, and I could see this being the rubber.",-1
4989,4989,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Whether it was made by haifu or not, it feels like a euro chinese hybrid, like tenergy.",-1
4990,4990,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I've tried tenergy, vega pro, vega europe, bryce speed, top energy soft, barracuda, haifu blue whale II, hurricane II & III (neo/provincial), all the srivers, mark V, JO waldner, All the tensor coppa's.",-1
4991,4991,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Traction MS pro so far feels like a slightly tacky tenergy top sheet and a medium chinese tuned sponge...it is not hard, it is not soft (but for a chinese rubber yes it is softer).If this rubber produces as much spin as it is advertised to have, or even 95% of the spin tenergy 05 produces I have a feeling it will be a loopers dream.",-1
4992,4992,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'll give a full review of this rubber tuesday night.,-1
4993,4993,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Got a chance to see one today from a friend, ita a Haifu Shark 2 or 3 with a mid hard pink sponge, 100% sure it's a shark, hit a few ball with it, not worth the $55, I rather get the shark, he also said, he left it out for a few mins and it expanded by a few inches",-1
4994,4994,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"If it's a higher quality version of the Shark II or III, that would not be so bad...Can you explain that please, I don't get it?",-1
4995,4995,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I've never tried shark...I'm pretty sure it isn't though.,-1
4996,4996,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's tack is very small, and the top sheet after a second hit with the robot has a very donic like feel...The sponge could be the same, but It doesn't quite feel like any of the Haifu rubber I've tried.",-1
4997,4997,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Also I bought mine for 45 at Americantabletennis.com Maybe if I try shark sometime I'll be able to confirm it, but from what it looks like I'm most likely either sticking with this rubber, or going back to giant dragon top energy.",-1
4998,4998,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,What's your impression of the topsheet?,-1
4999,4999,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Is it thin, soft and elastic or is it quite stiff?",-1
5000,5000,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Me either.,-1
5001,5001,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The topsheet is elastic...Like a donic rubber with a little added tack....the sponge is not hard....I don't understand the marketing on this thing...If you've played tenergy 05 and coppa jo gold....the topsheet is kinda somewhere between the two in elasticity and feel with very very minor chinese like tack...It seriously hardly feels chinese.,-1
5002,5002,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,you know how donic rates the numbers on there rubber like s1 as hard s2 medium s3 as soft....I'd say its a s2 or s3 chinese rubber...a true hybrid...I wonder if I'll get the benefits that I've found from chinese rubber.,-1
5003,5003,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I feel like when I play with chinese rubber the rallys are shorter, but thats not a bad thing.When I play jap/euro rubber the rallys are longer and I have better control on my loop.I want both....but I guess I just gotta train cause no matter what rubber I use.",-1
5004,5004,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If I can't keep the ball on the table that day it doesn't really matter.,-1
5005,5005,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,How about we compare pictures of Shark II and this rubber to finally once and for remove the 1% doubt that they are the same thing,-1
5006,5006,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Thanks tabesamis!Yes it still does sound like Shark II (or III) to me... this rubber also hardly feels like a Chinese rubber.,-1
5007,5007,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Ok. As promised here's my review of Shark III ....I mean Donic Traction MS PRO.As already said it's a slightly tacky factory tuned ""hard"" sponged rubber.As I previously told you It's not hard....In fact I'm not sure if its the top sheet or the tuning, but I find it slightly mushy.",-1
5008,5008,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'd put it at a 35.8 degree??,-1
5009,5009,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"?....not as hard as tenergy but not really soft either.Here are my impressions by shot.serve: It has enough spin to load up on the serves, but not quite as much as a chinese rubber, or tenergy 05.",-1
5010,5010,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The fact that it didn't spin as much actually confused my opponents.,-1
5011,5011,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'm not sure why.,-1
5012,5012,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Maybe its my blade.,-1
5013,5013,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Either way it serves fine.THrow angle: I'd put it at just below medium.,-1
5014,5014,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"You can loop most things over the net, but all the heavy backspin shots I looped clipped the top of the net, probably because I normally use a tacky rubber, and when I used to use Tenergy 05 the thing had a really high throw angle, so that could be me, but it doesn't launch shots high.Loop vs block: This is where the rubber shines.",-1
5015,5015,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"You can loop, and loop, and loop , and loop.",-1
5016,5016,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Its rather easy, and when an opponent blocks it's a good thing for you.Counterlooping: This is also really the best part of the rubber.",-1
5017,5017,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's easier than with the chinese rubber I was using.,-1
5018,5018,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It really good though.pushing: It isn't too fast that you don't have any touch.,-1
5019,5019,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Does it shine in this area????,-1
5020,5020,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,no.,-1
5021,5021,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"But it will get you to the point where you can either loop, or counter loop.Blocking: I really thought this would be an area that this rubber would be great, but I'd say it's only average.",-1
5022,5022,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's not horrible, but not great.",-1
5023,5023,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Disclaimer: blocking is the worst part of my game, but I've had better blocking results with several other sheets.chopping: Strange...you can chop with this rubber.",-1
5024,5024,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's not too bad.,-1
5025,5025,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Its not made for chopping I'm just saying you can.Overall: Donic Traction Ms pro is a very good rubber for looping.,-1
5026,5026,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The lower throw angle makes me think this would be a good backhand rubber for a two wing looper.,-1
5027,5027,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If I was still doing that I'd choose this for my backhand.,-1
5028,5028,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I'd give this rubber a 8 out of 10 primarily because even though it loops well, it doesn't produce as much spin as I'd want out of it.",-1
5029,5029,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,And there is nothing spectacular about his rubber other than it's looping ability.,-1
5030,5030,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If there's anything else you want to know.,-1
5031,5031,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Ask:),-1
5032,5032,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Thanks a lot tabesamis, great review!Was there any evidence that this rubber was tuned, like an oily residue on the sponge?When I used the Shark II, i found it to be quite bouncy for the short game... and this seemed to get worse over time (possible as the tuning effect wear off).",-1
5033,5033,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Did you find this on the Traction as well?I assume the Traction Pro Soft will be even softer...,-1
5034,5034,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I think the only indication of the tuning was the packaging.,-1
5035,5035,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It came vaccum sealed with the normal cover over the sponge.I did find the tack wore off quite quickly which could be a good or bad thing depending on your rubber preference.,-1
5036,5036,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It was quite bouncy in the short game but for your traditional two winged looper I don't think this would be a problem, because it would provide enough control to play a backhand control game that would consist or more flips than pushes.Also the sponge didn't really dome as much as the pics of shark in the forum....Maybe the effects wouldn't deteriorate as fast with use...I'm not really sure because though I may like it for looping it wasn't as effective against underspin (looping underspin) as I'd like when I came back to the table from chopping with my backhand.",-1
5037,5037,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'd say it was a waste of 45 bucks for me but I'll probably get a return from it by selling it on a newer blade.Overall great for looping topspin.,-1
5038,5038,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Ok for looping underspin...Good for hitting...other than that everything is just average.,-1
5039,5039,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Assuming Shark II on medium red sponge is the same as the pro rubber, it's not very bouncy, just a nice amount and about the same as Hexer except with less dwell since the sponge is harder.",-1
5040,5040,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Red top sheet visually is clear and the same colour as Hexer, it's non tacky and the pimples are larger than Hexer.",-1
5041,5041,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"One thing about the top sheet is that it's very thin, almost paper thin, about 1/3rd the thickness of hexers sheet.",-1
5042,5042,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's also made from a very crumbly rubber, performance rather than long life was the goal when they designed this rubber.I'm quite excited about the rubber because it feels like it's going to be a total weapon, I'll play a few hours on it tomorrow and update then, hopefully it doesn't fall to bits",-1
5043,5043,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Tried the Shark II red sponger, it works good.",-1
5044,5044,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"By hard rubber standards Shark is a very soft and dynamic rubber but it's still harder, faster and louder than Hexer.",-1
5045,5045,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I feel more confidant with it than the soft jello like feel of Hexer, Shark feels more stable.. yet it's a bit wild, it's very stinky too lol, my whole car smells like downtown Tianjin China.",-1
5046,5046,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I was tired today so couldn't play very well today no matter what I was using so it's a little hard to say just yet how good the rubber is but so far it's does everything you need a rubber to do.,-1
5047,5047,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's much easier to loop with for me for than Hexer and Shark is lower throw and I much prefer that in the rubber than high throw.,-1
5048,5048,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,What I can't test out how well it blocks just because I don't have anyone good enough to practice with.,-1
5049,5049,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I have some more things to try tomorrow on the forehand and I'll use Shark on the BH to see how lazer like it is once I've had some sleep,-1
5050,5050,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The stink is a bit of a worry... not sure if it's would pass the VOC test if it smells that strong...,-1
5051,5051,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It actually doesn't actually say anywhere on the packet that it's voc free or under any value, my eye hurts if I look in the packet lol",-1
5052,5052,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Shark II red sponger is turning out to be the best forehand offensive rubber I've used, I'm not sure how many people will be able to lift it but it's deadly if you can.",-1
5053,5053,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It doesn't chop so well but it's about perfect for everything else.,-1
5054,5054,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"More spin than hexer, more speed and more control, that's about all I can ask for, I haven't torn the top sheet which I'm quite surprised at given how thin it is.",-1
5055,5055,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'm also not sure how long the tuning is going to last.,-1
5056,5056,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If I could buy 3 sheets of it per season and have this performance all season I'd be happy enough,-1
5057,5057,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I just cut a sheet of Traction MS soft.,-1
5058,5058,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The topsheet is certainly not as fragile as the sheets of Shark that I tried (a while ago now)...,-1
5059,5059,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I could stretch it to about double the size before it snapped.,-1
5060,5060,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Sponge feels nice and soft.Instruction tell you to remove plastics sheets from both the topsheet and sponge, and leave for 10mins before gluing to the bat.",-1
5061,5061,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,They also said to apply glue only to the blade... so I guess the glue layer on the back is enough to make it stick.,-1
5062,5062,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Hopefully!I am considering ms soft and xiom omega iv elite (or a newer elite if they come out with one) on the fh side of the Ross Leidy blade that I will get in 6 months.Hope to hear how it plays, and whether or not the rubber will even stick!And just curious, how tacky is it?It sounds like it can be a massively spinny rubber!",-1

5064,5064,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Stick to the blade?,-1
5065,5065,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Yes no problems sticking it down... it comes flat out of the packet.,-1
5066,5066,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,That's good!Hope that it plays well,-1
5067,5067,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I bought a used sheet of Donic Traction MS Soft.,-1
5068,5068,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The sheet had no glue layer on the sponge anymore but apart fromthat it looks like new..Topsheet is red and the sponge yellow.,-1
5069,5069,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,As I had the rubber in my hands my first thought was : Its a Shark II (also a yellow sponge in the first version) My current shark is a training version and came without the glue layer on the sponge 35°Then I got my shark II out of the stash and compared it.,-1
5070,5070,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"All I can say is: the sponge is the same (color, texture and density-shark 35°) as my shark II ,but the topsheet is a bit different: The shark topsheets pimpels are just a fraction smaller in diameter and it is more translucent then the Donic Topsheet.",-1
5071,5071,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,They are both very thin and I can not say if one is thinner or not.,-1
5072,5072,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The look the same thickness to me!The bounce on the blade is very good and you can feel the glue effect.,-1
5073,5073,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I will have a hit with it in the next few days and give you some more impressions.I will also give comparison with a Palio Blitz 47,5° as it is on the backside of the blade...",-1

5425,5425,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I'm not 100% happy with either H2 or Thors as a complete package and both have flaws which you have to play around.,-1
5426,5426,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,In the end I can use either H2 or Thors and play at the same level whatever but Thors is a much more powerful rubber and because you can bend the ball around the net at will and win points from full court length + do all kinds of trick stuff so easily it's much more fun to use so I'll choose it over H2 just for the fun factor since it doesn't cost me points although anywhere much below 2000 us level I think you would be better served with H2 just because it's so much easier to control.,-1
5427,5427,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Make no mistake Thors is harder to use at full pace than any other tensor and any tenergy, it's very demanding but that seems the price you have to pay for a very powerful tacky rubber.The third rubber nathanso mentioned TG3 is probably the best bet for most people since it more side spinny than H2, not quite as deceptive as H2 but is more easy to use than either Thors or H2, it's actually softer in the top sheet than H2 and has the same sponge so any feeling of it being harder is just go old DHS variation or a harder degree sponge.",-1
5428,5428,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"The tackiness varies wildly also, some TG3 are very tacky and some aren't hardly tacky at all, just depends on what day it was made, all the red DHS rubbers are more consistant in this way and I only buy red sheets of DHS rubbers now because of that reason, they tend to be ""just right"", they also last longer The end of the story I think is for you who naturally hits with sidespin..

5436,5436,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I don't think that can be a bottoming out feeling... the sponge is simply too hard to bottom out IMO.,-1
5437,5437,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"The only time you can ever slightly bottom Thors is counter hitting a very well hit ball as hard as you can, I doubt more than 1% of the table tennis population can achieve that kind of speed, it happens a long time after T05 or any of the other famous tensors, when it does happen you can see the ball fly straighter than usual, normally it ends in a long ball even from full court.",-1
5438,5438,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Imho the people that say it bottoms out easily are feeling the rubber and sponge going squirrly because it doesn't bottom out, when you get a rubber and blade combination just right for your power you want it to just kiss the blade on your biggest and best attacking shots, this gives the whole combo a nice stabilising effect and that's what you should always aim for.",-1
5439,5439,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,2.1mm T05 will do that just nicely on the FH of a strong looper and I think it's one of the major reasons it's so popular with good players.,-1

6081,6081,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,Pretty hard sponge lacks feel (on an Andro Super Core Off+) but gives a positive air to the rubber - it's getting the ball back rather than sinking in.,-1

6100,6100,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,As many would agree there are few faults with Tenergy but as I use an all wood 4-ply blade I was wanting a softer sponge to allow more feeling on my BH loop.,-1
6101,6101,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,This is very important when having fun while playing against people like Haggisv who with his evil pimples I need all the feeling I can get LOL.,-1
6102,6102,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I have tried many of the latest glue effect rubbers from different companies and always felt none came close to the feeling of how I use to play with a glued up rubber.,-1
6103,6103,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Then Haggisv lent me a new carbon blade and rubber from this French company whom I have never heard of and I really didn't like their rubber.,-1
6104,6104,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It was all speed, little spin or control, but on the BH side was Haifu's Shark 2 tuned and I really liked it!",-1

6107,6107,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Physical properties:Shark 3 is written on the package but on the rubber is Shark Speed, strange to have 2 names for one rubber but it comes in a vacuum packaging the same as Haifu's other tuned rubber like Blue Whale 2 and Shark 2.",-1
6108,6108,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I really was not expecting Shark 3 to be so DIFFERENT from Shark 2.,-1
6109,6109,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,When I tested the Shark 2 from Haggisv it used a light super soft yellow sponge but on Shark 3 it has a heavy dense pink sponge.,-1
6110,6110,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I included the pictures of the weights of my uncut Tenergy to compare the uncut Shark 3.,-1
6111,6111,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,There is a layer of glue on the back of the pink sponge but it is a lot thinner than the thick layer on my old Blue Whale 2.,-1
6112,6112,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Some people remove this layer to save weight but I think this layer adds to the bounce and feel of the rubber.,-1
6113,6113,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The rubber has quite a good dome straight from the package, while the sponge being an unusual dark pink colour is quite dense and heavy, but is actually quite soft, nothing like any other Chinese rubber I have used.",-1
6114,6114,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Haifu mark this sponge as 34 degrees with their laser type etching on the bottom.This is the first rubber I have ever bought or heard of that has the degrees and thickness hand written on the sponge!,-1
6115,6115,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The factory workers in China must have hand cramps if they mark every sponge personally.,-1

6118,6118,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is so beautiful to look at almost translucent with the Chinese characters looking amazing.,-1
6119,6119,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,This sheet is similar to a Japanese Bryce in its looks but feels very Chinese in its texture.,-1
6120,6120,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is not tacky at all and can not pick up a ball from the table.,-1
6121,6121,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The sheet is extremely grippy just like Tenergy but in a more synthetic way.,-1
6122,6122,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Speed :For the grip this rubber has it has amazing speed Compared to my Tenergy on the same stroke and power it is about 20% faster.,-1
6123,6123,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I would not class it as a speed demon but 20% faster than Tenergy is still quite fast.,-1
6124,6124,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"For this amount of speed you get massive spin as well, unlike other speed only rubbers.",-1
6125,6125,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is more springy than Tenergy but in a wonderful glue feel way.,-1
6126,6126,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I can feel the ball bite into the rubber and it feels like it stays there for a split moment then catapults out like my old speed glue rubbers.,-1
6127,6127,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"This feeling I have found missing in all my other glue effect rubbers, so I am thrilled that this Shark3 has this feeling as well as a HUGE click sound.",-1
6128,6128,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is louder than any rubber I have tried without speed glue and even louder than my Donic F3 Big Slam which only gets its super loud click from a ridiculously super soft sponge.,-1
6129,6129,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Unlike the Big Slam and other soft sponge rubbers which bottom out so easily this Shark3 keeps on spinning and keeping control even with very strong power loops.,-1
6130,6130,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,However it does have its limits for a soft sponge so I agree with the recommendation from Haifu that this rubber suits a BH and not a FH if you loop really hard.,-1
6131,6131,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Spin: I see and feel very little difference in the spin generated from Shark 3 compared to my Tenergy.,-1
6132,6132,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Tenergy still has more but the effect on your oponent during the game is very similer.,-1
6133,6133,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,On serves it can do all the serves I can do with Tenergy but with far more control.,-1
6134,6134,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Short backspin serves can be done where the ball rolls back to the net after 3 or 4 bounces so plenty of spin.On my BH I can loop backspin more easily than I could with the Tenergy as the ball sinks into the sponge more and gives me more feeling.,-1
6135,6135,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Even though this rubber does have a lower throw than Tenergy it is not a big difference so I did not have to make too many changes to my technique.,-1
6136,6136,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Control :Here again this rubber so surprised me on my punch blocks.The ball just catapults off with a loud crack and goes wherever I wanted it to go.,-1
6137,6137,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I am not fighting with this rubber for control like other speed rubbers but feel it is working with me to put the ball in the right place.,-1
6138,6138,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The same goes for loops.,-1
6139,6139,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I would say it has 70% of the control I get from Tenergy which is really good as I find Tenergy to be one of the best control rubbers out there.,-1
6140,6140,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,On pushes this rubber is more springy but still retains it's control.,-1
6141,6141,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I will need to practice more to get my short pushes as short as I could with Tenergy but I think with a few more weeks of practice I will.,-1
6142,6142,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Other playing properties and comments :Put simply this rubber is a BEAST, period.",-1
6143,6143,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,If this rubber was put on a hard and fast 5-ply carbon blade then it would be a very formidable combination with huge possibilities of getting quite close to reliving the feeling of playing with a speed glued rubber.Besides the positives I have mentioned above there are a few negatives as well.The first negative is the price.,-1
6144,6144,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,For me it cost $15AUD less than my Tenergy!,-1
6145,6145,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Granted it is not as expensive as the crazy priced $90+USD Whale 3 but asking close to a Tenergy price for a Chinese rubber is a pretty tough ask.,-1
6146,6146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,My last Blue Whale 2 tuned lasted me about 2 days of training before a huge bubble appeared in the center.,-1
6147,6147,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Now I don't mind paying the premium price asked for Tenergy or any other Japanese rubber I have used as every single sheet I have ever bought has been flawless, never split or bubbled and lasted me far longer than the cheaper priced but soo short grip life of the bouncy ESN rubbers.",-1
6148,6148,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"So I gave the Chinese a second chance, thinking if they are charging close to a Japanese price for their top of the line rubber then they must be very proud and stand by their quality product.",-1
6149,6149,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Alas this brings me to my second negative, the durability.",-1
6150,6150,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,My flawless new sheet lasted 15 minutes before a bubble appeared.,-1
6151,6151,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Then after almost 30 minutes of hitting, small splits started to appear around the bubble.",-1
6152,6152,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The top sheet is as fragile as glass.,-1
6153,6153,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Even when cutting the rubber around my blade pieces just chipped off.,-1
6154,6154,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"When I stretched the off cut piece just a little, the top sheet splits instantly.",-1
6155,6155,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I could even peel the top sheet off easily from the sponge with little effort which is never a good sign, but with the Tenergy I can stretch an off cut and the sponge will tear long before the top sheet.",-1
6156,6156,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,This means either Haifu have tuned this rubber to an inch of its life and my loops are to much for the glue bonds to hold or they still have very poor quality control and are just trying to rip off Western buyers by charging massivly above the genuine and accurate price they charge within their own country.,-1
6157,6157,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It becomes a gamble if you get a good one or a bubbler like mine.,-1
6158,6158,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Now come on Haifu, this is no way to build brand loyality.",-1
6159,6159,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,If I wanted to waste $40USD I could think of much more fun ways to do it.,-1
6160,6160,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"If a customer buys their top premium rubber and it lasts 15mins, will they be so impressed and go and order another one.",-1
6161,6161,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I don't think so.,-1
6162,6162,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"To sum up, I really loved this new Haifu Shark 3.",-1
6163,6163,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It's the best BH rubber of the new glue effect generation of rubbers I have ever tried.,-1
6164,6164,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The top sheet looks beautiful, plays 80% like a speed glued sheet with an amazing and very loud click sound.",-1
6165,6165,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It has the spin and control very close to Tenergy and smells great but alas my love affair with the Shark 3 lasted 15 minutes as did my rubber.Besides being dissapointed wasting my money I am also angry with this rubber as it had so much potential to show Japan and Germany that China can make a quality rubber that can feel like a speed glue sheet instead of just claiming that it does on the packet like other companies do.When this sheet falls apart would I buy another, the answer is no.",-1
6166,6166,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I do not want to spend my money and after ever loop have an anxiety attack as I look on my sheet to see if it has bubbled or torn.,-1
6167,6167,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I always tried to give the benefit of the doubt to Chinese companies.,-1
6168,6168,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I would try one of their improved and ""latest"" rubbers from time to time hoping I would be happy with my purchase.",-1
6169,6169,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,So far I have not had much success.,-1
6170,6170,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"For my latest costly failure of a purchase, I believe until the Chinese realise quantity over quality is the wrong way to produce products, they will have no loyalty from customers who will simply spend their money with companies who make quality products and take pride in what they sell.",-1
6171,6171,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Fantastic review, thanks SubarashiOnizuka!SubarashiOnizuka showed me his rubber and the off-cut tonight, and it is indeed quite fragile and does not stretch far before it rips.",-1
6172,6172,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"We measured the sponge, and it came out at 38deg on my scale, which is very nice and not likely to bottom out too quickly.I also hope this was a bad sheet and that most are a lot better, but Haifu do have to get their act together and sort out these issues as they are not restricted to just this rubber, but some of their earlier ones as well.",-1
6173,6173,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,What is the ITTF number on the sheet you reviewed?,-1

6175,6175,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It does not look like the ITTF approved Shark 3.,-1
6176,6176,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is probably the Shark 2 topsheet with the sponge meant for Shark 3.,-1

6180,6180,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,So i guess yours must have come from there itself.Shark 2 was really a very very impressive rubber for its price.,-1
6181,6181,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"my guess is that this rubber has been super tuned by the factory same as gambler outlaw maybe similar to haggisv super priming but with boosters without vocs, which brings the topsheet under extreme tension making it with very brittle and easy to bubble.",-1
6182,6182,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The topsheet has the word 'speed' on there, which i don't think the Shark 2 had.Yes i think he did get it from that shop...he can confirm...",-1

6263,6263,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),The outlaw and hurricane neo are much faster maybe 20% more but have less grip or hardly any.,-1
6264,6264,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I think i might throw in another side of the story  In order to switch from defensive to offensive gamestyle you need to go too a slower (5 layers without carbon) in order to inprove your skills.The problem with carbon blades is the they are very stiff and hard and therefore they offer very short dwell tim eand thereby control - when you have to change style it is too difficult to learn the strokes if the blade is too slow.,-1
6265,6265,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),In my opinion it is allways better to have fast rubbers and slower blade than fast blades and slow rubbers.I would think that a all+/off- blade would be a good choice.,-1

6267,6267,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),If you choose the Tenergy 05 you just have to adapt to the hifgher throw angle and close the angle a little.On the back hand i would try out the Butterfly Roundell which is easy to handle and when you are ready you could then move on to faster bh rubbers.Good luck with the TT journey.,-1

7914,7914,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),basically the low throw makes them think that it doesnt spin much or that it is more of a flatter hitting shot rather than a spinning ball.also that when my stroke seems like a heap of spin has gone into it and the ball does not rise much they tend to mishit or misblock...my hitting partner was telling me that he tends to step back a bit getting ready to counter and yet the ball has dipped before he gets to counter it.,-1

11223,11223,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,")Vs. the robot, it seems fast on forward strokes, but slow on chops.",-1
11224,11224,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I actually had to chop a bit harder to get my FH chops near the end line of the table.,-1
11225,11225,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,Kind of like I had to do with the LKT Pro topsheet with soft 1.2mm sponge.,-1
11226,11226,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"The chopping, once I adapted, was GREAT.",-1
11227,11227,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"Whether you do a push-style chop or a full-on side of the body JSK FH chop, the ball went back with an immense amount of spin.",-1
11228,11228,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"The balls kept popping back out of the ball catch due to the backspin, and often ramped out and got air.",-1
11229,11229,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"It’s safe to take a big stroke, but you have to adjust your angle because the throw becomes higher with racket speed.",-1
11230,11230,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"(Other less grippy rubbers don’t require as much attention in throw angle) To clarify, throw angle on chops is downward because the stroke is going downward, and therefore ball trajectory is lower and risks hitting the net.",-1
11231,11231,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"Blocks seem to have good pace, vs. Reflectoid which has more of a dampening feel.",-1
11232,11232,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"However the Defender was slow enough vs. hard/fast loops, and fast enough that it seems the opponent will have to pay attention.",-1
11233,11233,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"I really cranked up the robot, and didn’t notice any bottoming out and certainly no change in throw angle as you get from other thin rubbers when the ball makes contact with the blade.",-1
11234,11234,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"On active forward strokes, the rubber was much faster than I was expecting.",-1
11235,11235,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,It loops well; the throw is medium to medium low.,-1
11236,11236,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I was VERY surprised how fast it was on offense!,-1
11237,11237,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"This red sponge, I’m told, is the same as that comes on the new batch of Air Illumina rubbers and it is indeed lively…at least on offense.The rubber is not tacky, but VERY grippy.",-1
11238,11238,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"Grippy as in Tenergy/Xiom Omega IV type grip, without being nearly as fast.",-1
11239,11239,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,The grip supports brush-looping very well.,-1
11240,11240,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"Mid-distance looping was surprisingly good considering the thin sponge, but I didn’t feel any real problems with bottoming out.",-1
11241,11241,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"Again, this is all preliminary as I’ve only hit vs. the robot, but this rubber seems like it has “Classic” rubber speed on defense, but with Tensor rubber grippiness and speed on offense.",-1
11242,11242,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,It really seems like a great all-around rubber.,-1
11243,11243,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"So far, it feels about as fast as Vega Europe on offense, as slow as Shriver on defense, and about as spinny as Omega IV Asia (or even T05).",-1
11244,11244,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"I imagine this is what XIOM was trying to do with the Yanus DF rubber and it's ""2-face"" marketing spiel.",-1
11245,11245,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I reserve the right to change my impressions of everything vs. real people tonight.,-1
11246,11246,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"look forward to your review (and receiving my sheet as well)I am torn between trying to go to inverted chop, block hit on my BH or get a sheet of T80 in 1.9 and be an all out attacker/topspinner on my BH",-1
11247,11247,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,Awesome.It'll be interesting if your findings jive with mine.One thing I forgot to mention is that I am using this on a defplay senso...so you may find it acts differently on a different blade.,-1
11248,11248,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"I saw on ColesTT that you can now get DefenderS in 1.5, 1.9, or 2.1mm.",-1
11249,11249,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I think it might be worth a shot in 1.9mm for me to try out.,-1
11250,11250,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I feel like 1.5mm is too thin to loop effectively with.,-1
11251,11251,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,Have you tried assasinS?,-1
11252,11252,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,If you want to loop it may be a better choice.,-1

11254,11254,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I have been busy of late so I have only been able to play much except for few short matches since I last posted on this.,-1
11255,11255,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,But I have defender s in 1.5 black ( cole suggested it in black for getter grip).,-1
11256,11256,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I was very happy how I was able to loop on my back hand with it.,-1

11259,11259,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,In contrast I have the globe 999 top sheet with the soft air lemon in red 2.0 on the FH while practicing I would loop with the defenders s to feel the difference.,-1
11260,11260,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,"Both looped effectively the thing that stood out for me was between the two rubbers was that the 999 allowed a spiny late snap that made the loop more drastic at the end of the balls ark, which makes which makes sense since the globe in a 2.0 and it has more tack.",-1
11261,11261,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I still need to play some more with it but the touch with the short game seems really nice.,-1
11262,11262,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I felt a drastic difference between the defender S and the globe on returning short spiny serves.,-1
11263,11263,5f6c29934272aba9ab7757b7,Air DefenderS and AssassinS,I was returning a really nice low ball with touch that I found much more difficult to do against the same opponents with other rubbers I have.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,-1

11332,11332,5f6c29ce4272aba9ab7757d7,Rasant Grip and Powergrip,Going with my intuition Rasant Grip will have the rasant sponge which puts a lot of speed and spin regardless of the shot.,-1

11334,11334,5f6c29ce4272aba9ab7757d7,Rasant Grip and Powergrip,With the grip I'm sure the top sheet will be light tacky and has similarities to a chinese rubber.,-1
11335,11335,5f6c29ce4272aba9ab7757d7,Rasant Grip and Powergrip,It will most likely grip the ball a little more and give more spin.,-1

11781,11781,5f6c29f24272aba9ab7757e5,Tenergy 05 and 64 alternatives,His control was superb and T05 did the work for him as his counter hits consistently found the table and usually contained high levels of residual sidespin making them difficult or dangerous to attack on the rise.,-1

13384,13384,5f6c2f727da9e46ccbe156d8,ANDRO HEXER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS,Still it's not an easy shot like it is with a really soft sponged grippy rubber so I'd say the rubbers you have been using is what you should be using.,-1
13385,13385,5f6c2f727da9e46ccbe156d8,ANDRO HEXER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS,Those old time tacky rubbers (the real ones made in China) like DHS stuff with dead sponges still make more deadly spin than anything else but you really need to be very strong to make it happen with a lot of speed and ideally you need a good 5 ply blade and you need to be strong enough to make that blade bend.,-1
13386,13386,5f6c2f727da9e46ccbe156d8,ANDRO HEXER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS,I can still hit those with the same or maybe even more pace than Hexer but it takes an extreme effort and to be a realist I'm probably getting a bit too old for a rubber like that now,-1
13387,13387,5f6c2f727da9e46ccbe156d8,ANDRO HEXER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS,Reb you might consider the new Haifu BW2 Red sponge it's considerably lighter and less tacky and accordingly pretty good for flat hitting.,-1

13538,13538,5f6c2fb67da9e46ccbe15701,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo Comments and Questions,"Overall I really love this rubber its slower than hexer on most aspects of all aspects of the game except when looping close to the table, in terms of spin Hexer has more spin but not that much, In control at first I though this rubber has lousy control, I could barely block with it, My FH Chops were hitting the net, and Mid Distance looping was impossible.",-1
13539,13539,5f6c2fb67da9e46ccbe15701,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo Comments and Questions,"But after 1 hour of persistence it all paid off, Hurricane requires you to play with active strokes, which not only makes your game better but you put more spin and speed on the ball, when blocking it must be with an active stroke with hexer I would just put the blade still and block, with Hurricane you must guide your block, give it a little push this gives you the power to place that block anywhere on the table.",-1
13540,13540,5f6c2fb67da9e46ccbe15701,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo Comments and Questions,"When FH chopping with Andro I was doing it lazy, a soft FH chop which would get in but would not disturb my opponent, with Hurricane you must do proper technique and you can really chop that ball without fear and my parter who is a 2 winged looper who's 500 points ahead of me was visibly not so consistent putting balls back, he immediately asked me ""Thats not Hexer right""?.",-1
13541,13541,5f6c2fb67da9e46ccbe15701,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo Comments and Questions,And on looping from mid distance you must get under the ball a little bit since the rubber is so linear.,-1
13542,13542,5f6c2fb67da9e46ccbe15701,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo Comments and Questions,"Overall I can say this is my new FH rubber, Im glad i found it since Hexer will be soon at a higher price.",-1

13921,13921,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,and I gotta tell ya the FH rubber for me is just as important for a defender (I hate calling myself a defender because I seek to make the best shot possible at any moment which actually may be an attack stroke) as the bh junk rubber.,-1

13924,13924,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,Its faster than tackiness-c but does a good job of chopping-its just a tad faster but you sense the spriness in the 32 deg white sponge eventhough its 2mm thicker than my 1.5 mm Tack-C.The surface sheet is very similar not tacky at all just like Tack-C.,-1
13925,13925,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,The main difference is that can attack better and every defender needs to make effective surprise attacks.,-1
13926,13926,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,I would add that for most people who block close to the table its better than a slower rubber because the ball goes back deepbut not off the table (of course that dependes on who is hitting against you).,-1
13927,13927,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,Dead rubbers might not have enough speed to put the ball back on the other side of the table but with flextra I get optimal length and good ball placement when I'm stretched or rushed.,-1
13928,13928,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,Long Pimples are like that too thats why I like chinese pips because speed can be helpful too.Yes it all depends on philosophy ie do you have different setups to play a specific opponent or do you have one setup that allows you to play a wide range of players.,-1
13929,13929,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,I have elected for the latter and that is the reason I like flextra - it can do it all.,-1

13932,13932,5f6c30417da9e46ccbe15757,Favorite inverted for chopping and loop,Once again it depends on who I'm playing against but I find that this rubber provides optimal blocking length versus a wide range of opponents.,-1

14399,14399,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"For some months now I have been playing with DHS Hurricane 2 Neo on the FH and Hurrican 3 Neo on the BH.Lately, I decided to experiment a bit with other Chinese rubbers.",-1
14400,14400,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"While I like the DHS rubbers mentioned above, I am really unhappy with sheet-to-sheet inconsistency.",-1
14401,14401,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"The quality control is just not there, especially considering the premium price (for a Chinese rubber) you have to pay.",-1
14402,14402,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,They run about $27 per sheet.,-1
14403,14403,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I have also heard that DHS is constantly tuning and improving these rubbers, which does not make me feel a whole lot better: maybe it is not due to QC, but all the sheets are different regardless.AIR Scirocco SR rubber did not fit my game too well.Since then I have also re-visited Gambler Outlaw (2nd generation) which I liked very much on the BH.",-1
14404,14404,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I suspect that 3rd generation Outlaw (due to arrive pretty soon) will be even better.In the meantime, I tried two new LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond on FH and BH, respectively.Red Diamond is a nice semi-tacky rubber with very good grip and medium speed.",-1
14405,14405,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It is kinda like Cream MRS with a much livelier sponge.,-1
14406,14406,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The throw angle is medium and there is enough pop in the rubber to play well both off the table and over the table.,-1
14407,14407,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"The topsheet is quite thick, similar to traditional Chinese topsheets.",-1
14408,14408,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The sponce is light red.,-1
14409,14409,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"It is supposed to be 2.1mm, but looks thicker.",-1
14410,14410,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Perhaps that is an aftereffect of the pressure box.,-1
14411,14411,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I think the strength of this rubber is controlled looping.,-1
14412,14412,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I could vary the spin and speed of the ball at will and the rubber never stalled.,-1
14413,14413,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Pushing and blocking were good as well, but I really enjoyed the looping aspect of it: the topsheet has enough grip to be excellent for over the table looping, while the sponge allows for big loop drives off the table.",-1
14414,14414,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I do not know if I will stick with it on the BH.,-1
14415,14415,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I might go back to the Outlaw, but I can imaging that it would work really well for a lot of people on the FH.Black Power, I believe, is going to replace H2 Neo on my FH.",-1
14416,14416,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"It has a medium throw angle: higher than H2 Neo, but lower than H3 Neo.",-1
14417,14417,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,In that regard it is most similar to TG3 Neo.,-1
14418,14418,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"It has mid-tacky topsheet, so you can do all the traditional things chinese rubbers are good for: over the table brush loops, serves, etc.",-1
14419,14419,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Howeve, that black 2.1mm sponge has a lot more pace in it than all the Neo rubbers if you are inclined to extract it.",-1
14420,14420,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It plays noticeably better away from the table.,-1
14421,14421,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"The topsheet is not as thick as that on the Red Diamond and pips are slightly wider spaced, so it is a bit more dynamic.",-1
14422,14422,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,In that regard it is also closer to DHS' Skyline Neo rubbers: they have thinner topsheets with quicker release.,-1
14423,14423,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"However, the sponge is unlike anything I have seen on a Chinese rubber before.",-1
14424,14424,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"It is quite porous, somewhat similar to Tenergy and Hexer sponge, though with smaller pores.",-1
14425,14425,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"It is also treated with a pressure box, which likely gives it more pop.",-1
14426,14426,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"In many ways it needs to be treated a little bit like Tenergy: to block consistently, you should keep the blade face a bit more closed than normal and when pushing you want to make sure the sponge does not come into play.",-1
14427,14427,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"However, all of that is made up in spades once you go on offensive: loops are wickedly spinny and fast.",-1
14428,14428,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"If you want to slow it down, brush looping works very well as well.",-1
14429,14429,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"However, it has one more gear: loopdrive.",-1
14430,14430,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Just close the blade face a little, take half a step away from the table and swing for the fences.",-1
14431,14431,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,This rubber certainly seems to reward bravery.,-1
14432,14432,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,A lot of my game is based on strong 3rd ball attack off of a push and I could completely overpower whatever spins was on the push.ILya,-1
14433,14433,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Wow, great post ILya, thank you!",-1
14434,14434,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Nice review ILya.,-1
14435,14435,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,One question though.,-1
14436,14436,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Is Red Diamond really grippy or tacky in your opinion?,-1
14437,14437,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Because I'm gonna use Black Diamond on the FH and I wanted to make Red Diamond my backhand but I never really liked tacky rubbers in my BH.,-1
14438,14438,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I""m still using under $20 rubbers for my backhand.",-1
14439,14439,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Red Diamond is a combination of grippy and tacky.,-1
14440,14440,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"It is not super tacky, but there tackiness to it.",-1
14441,14441,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"If you do not like tacky rubbers on the BH, perhaps you should consider Outlaw.ILya",-1
14442,14442,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Do you guys think it can feel like Tenergy???,-1
14443,14443,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I also will try to get the Black Power, and post a review after.",-1
14444,14444,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Nah I'll just settle for Red Diamond.,-1
14445,14445,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Maybe this type of rubber will be actually good for my backhand based on the review you gave.,-1
14446,14446,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I kinda like Cream MRS on my backhand.,-1
14447,14447,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It's better than settling for whatever cheap grippy rubbers I find.,-1
14448,14448,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"That makes sense, the other LKT rubbers are like that too.",-1
14449,14449,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I loved the LKT XT when I could glue it, it was awesome for spin but lacked in speed.",-1
14450,14450,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"If either of these play like this, I'll be keen to try it too.",-1
14451,14451,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Just placed an order from Zeropong.,-1
14452,14452,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Hopefully I'll be doing an Avalox P500 Review with Pictures + Black Power and Red Diamond as well with pictures.,-1
14453,14453,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Just need to find my cheap Chinese camera....,-1
14454,14454,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"That will be great, especially since it's on a well known blade!",-1
14455,14455,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I just need to know how to use Macro on the camera.,-1
14456,14456,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,power rangers LOL,-1
14457,14457,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I built two bats for students using Ayous/hinoki with RD and BP.,-1
14458,14458,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"From the talk on the forums, I figured RD on the backhand.",-1
14459,14459,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I tried both bats out and found the RD much spinnier and higher throw than the BP.,-1
14460,14460,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,So I have the students using RD on the forhand.,-1
14461,14461,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I already had tried BP on the forhand of one of my Yinhe W-1s.,-1
14462,14462,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,This got my curiousity up about the RD on the W-1 so I got one.,-1
14463,14463,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"On the ayous/hinoki, both were a little slow for me but made a perfect bat for the students.",-1
14464,14464,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Now, on the W-1, it makes a great setup for me.",-1
14465,14465,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The RD is again higher throw than the BP.,-1
14466,14466,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The RD is good with all strokes including brush strokes.,-1
14467,14467,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The BP makes a great blocking rubber with plenty of speed and spin for loops.,-1
14468,14468,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The RD does it all.,-1
14469,14469,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I can make powerful loops from a distance and over the table.,-1
14470,14470,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Control on both is very good.,-1
14471,14471,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,This is my new setup.,-1
14472,14472,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It is replacing my H-3 National and Sriver FX.,-1
14473,14473,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The new setup is a little slower than my other but that is OK.,-1
14474,14474,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I have even more control now.,-1
14475,14475,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"When I came back from China, I knew I wanted to replace the H-3 National as you never know what you will get here.",-1
14476,14476,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"The Sriver FX was good and lasts a long time but if I can use something that costs less, that is what I will use.",-1
14477,14477,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Overall, my game is better with the new setup.",-1
14478,14478,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The small loss of speed is made up for with even better control.I just bought another RD and it still has the same sponge.,-1
14479,14479,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I have not seen or tried the ""New"" BP.",-1
14480,14480,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Heard it has a different sponge.,-1
14481,14481,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I agree.,-1
14482,14482,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I like RD's spin to speed ratio but I am unimpressed with BP.,-1
14483,14483,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,BP is OK for BH.,-1
14484,14484,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I have them mounted on a BTY BC X5.,-1
14485,14485,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,RD/BP is a pretty hot setup for students but the price is right.,-1
14486,14486,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Yes, RD/BP is a ""hot"" setup for students, even on the Ayous/hinoki.",-1
14487,14487,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I would not recommend it for students with no coach.,-1
14488,14488,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"(these students have a good coach, LOL, Me) On the W-1, it is very good for me.",-1
14489,14489,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I have let the students try mine to see the difference and you can see thier consistancy drop.,-1
14490,14490,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Something I do not understand is all the people on other forums saying the BP has higher throw than the RD.,-1
14491,14491,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I have both on the same bat.,-1
14492,14492,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"If I turn the bat, and play my normal stroke, the BP goes in the net every time.",-1
14493,14493,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Same with the students bats.,-1
14494,14494,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I consider the BP to have just the right things for backhand, low or medium throw, not as reactive to spin and very good control.",-1
14495,14495,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Still plenty of speed and spin for loops.,-1

14498,14498,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The only reason I do not try to compare RD to Tenergy is all the flak I would get.,-1

14503,14503,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Hope it does not change it much.,-1
14504,14504,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,They aren't really comparable apart from Red Diamond being able to make big shots and it can make some very big shots that will surprise you from time to time with the awesome of it.,-1

14517,14517,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I hope the sponge on the RD is not the same crumbly one since I have already ordered one sheet of RD.,-1
14518,14518,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,That might be related to pressure treatment they say they do on the sponge...,-1
14519,14519,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"Outlaw is quite crumbly too, although I can think of a few others plain rubber which also seem to have a sponge like that.I suggest you don't glue them on too tight, so that they are more easily removable.",-1
14520,14520,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"What is important to me in a rubber, is how it plays.",-1
14521,14521,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,The sponge is crumbly but is not a problem unless you are changing it from one bat to another all the time.,-1

14523,14523,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Just buy more.,-1

14526,14526,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Rubber cement should not be used with many of the newer rubbers.,-1
14527,14527,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It changes the way the rubbers play.,-1

14532,14532,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I have not seen any evidence of rubbers that are glued with rubber cement playing any different.,-1

14538,14538,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I still have it and put it on an old blade.,-1
14539,14539,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It never did recover to the same as a Tenergy glued with water glue.,-1
14540,14540,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I used the three layers as that is what I used to do with any new sponge.,-1
14541,14541,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Fair enough... that explains it...,-1
14542,14542,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,As you can see below currently have RD on my fore hand & BP on Back hand.,-1
14543,14543,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I'm happy with the set up and BP is really good at solid blocks.,-1
14544,14544,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It tends to sit the ball up a little high on my chops but works well for my BH loops.,-1
14545,14545,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,RD has good control I wouldn't say its quick and dose not appear to have lots of spin on fh loops but great for serves.,-1
14546,14546,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Also during a recent coaching I was advised that RD wasn't doing much for my fore hand.,-1
14547,14547,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I think thats just my style and as I've posted that I'm looking for feedback on Focus 3 snipe as a change of rubber on FH.,-1
14548,14548,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Just to wrap up though Black power works really well on my BH but BP just sits up that little to high on chops compared to Higher 3 .,-1
14549,14549,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,However RD and BP are good alround rubbers RD has only one small chip after 4 months and if I clean it with water a fair bit of Tack comes back to the rubber.,-1
14550,14550,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,BP no issues (accept that chop thing),-1

14553,14553,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,RD isn't the most spiny rubber in the world but it's close enough and faster than most of the rubbers that do make more spin.,-1
14554,14554,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,You can't have everything all at once,-1

14566,14566,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I agreed also and then started using the RD for the forhand.,-1
14567,14567,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Thats when I found out how good BP was for blocking.,-1
14568,14568,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I also believe spin can be affected by the blade used and the stroke.,-1

14597,14597,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Brush loops are real spinny with RD.,-1
14598,14598,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,How did you find the throw angle?,-1
14599,14599,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I found the RD higher than BP.,-1
14600,14600,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,One of the reasons I like the BP for backhand.,-1

14602,14602,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Just enough to know Red Diamond is the much better forehand rubber.,-1
14603,14603,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I also can't make anywhere near as much spin with a normal grippy rubber as I can with a tacky rubber.Like you I have one main practice partner who is very good at telling the difference in spin between the rubbers I'm using, having returned 1000's of my loops he knows better than anyone what I'm able to make the most spin with, he can pick out just tiny amounts of more or less spin much more accurately than I can.",-1
14604,14604,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,By the way my practice partner now uses Red Diamond on the FH and Black Power on the BH just because he liked how I hit Red Diamond when I was testing them against him earlier in the year.,-1
14605,14605,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,He uses Black Power on the backhand because it's the most similar black rubber (same sponge).I've compared the top sheets between them.,-1
14606,14606,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,They both run a vertical line type pimples (like the DHS rubbers) Most friendship rubbers run in horizontal lines.,-1
14607,14607,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Both RD and BP have identical spacing between the pimples but RD has a much thinner diameter pimple it's in fact the same size as a Hurricane 2 pimple which is still thick in it's own right but H2 runs much wider apart pimple spacing than RD and BP do.,-1
14608,14608,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,BP is highly unconventional running both a medium kind of spacing (same as RD) but with a very large pimple.,-1
14609,14609,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I can see why that would make it a much stiffer more stable rubber for blocking on the backhand and less spiny than Red Diamond.,-1
14610,14610,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Red Diamond isn't a good rubber for slow connecting shots but I don't think it was ever intended to be.,-1
14611,14611,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,It's got a fairly hard sponge and everything about it is setup to be a proper offensive looping rubber.,-1
14612,14612,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"I'm not sure what the purpose of Black Power was supposed to be, not a ""normal"" forehand rubber anyway but maybe for some people it's more awesome than normal, it does seem to suit the backhand of a lot of people.Also over the course of this year the quality of these rubbers has improved out of sight, the latest ones I got are really good looking sheets without the weird sticky layer that was on the early ones",-1
14613,14613,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Hi..!!,-1
14614,14614,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,I am using Palio CJ8000 36-38 red rubber on my backhand and one of my friends tried it yesterday and said that it is very similar to Red Diamond rubber.,-1
14615,14615,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Has anybody used both these rubbers..??,-1
14616,14616,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,Are they really similar...?,-1
14617,14617,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,?,-1
14618,14618,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,not exactly.,-1
14619,14619,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"the biggest difference is that palio has much higher throw than RD, and therefore it is easier to loop against backspin.",-1
14620,14620,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"furthermore, palio has softer feel (RD is declared with 38 deg.",-1
14621,14621,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,"but feels like medium hardness rubber, while palio feels soft).",-1
14622,14622,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,therefore palio can be used on FH with caution because of softness while no problem with RD on FH.,-1
14623,14623,5f6c3184220a4650ffffd9f2,New LKT rubbers: Black Power and Red Diamond,the trajectory of ball is somehow different between these two rubbers also,-1

15640,15640,5f6c3378220a4650ffffdb39,Saturn and Apollo,I have the 41 degree sponge... not sure what hardness level that would equate to relative to BTY but it feels similar to the 999 I am also using (see signature) Apollo is definitely louder than the 999 sheet off the bat and is at least on par with the spin.,-1
15641,15641,5f6c3378220a4650ffffdb39,Saturn and Apollo,Loops dive like the rpm gauge on a Ferrari and serves are very spinny (of course) The sheet does attract a lot of dust so I used BTY foam cleaner (old school) - after that the sheet was less spinny because I did not have time to let it dry completely.,-1
15642,15642,5f6c3378220a4650ffffdb39,Saturn and Apollo,It has been raining all day so there was quite bit of humidity... that's ok because that really showed off how much spin this sheet can generate despite sub-perfect playing conditions.,-1

15648,15648,5f6c3378220a4650ffffdb39,Saturn and Apollo,It has the kind of look that makes me think nothing I hit is coming back due to the amount of topspin I'm going to be putting on the ball.,-1
15649,15649,5f6c3378220a4650ffffdb39,Saturn and Apollo,It is about the same thickness of the 999 topsheet but has a more delicate look... that is the best I can describe it.,-1
15650,15650,5f6c3378220a4650ffffdb39,Saturn and Apollo,There was no crumbling however... except for when I cut it out on the blade... but I pretty much suck at that so probably my fault there.,-1

16071,16071,5f6c3474220a4650ffffdbc7,An old and a new sheet of table tennis rubber tested: Outlaw,The only reason I can think of for the difference in spin feeling is whether players brush the ball to create spin or rely a little more on hitting through the ball.,-1
16072,16072,5f6c3474220a4650ffffdbc7,An old and a new sheet of table tennis rubber tested: Outlaw,I've discussed this with haggisv and I think he described it as Asian style vs European style where Euro rubbers are typically softer than their Asian counter parts (think Xiom's range and their Asian sponge / Euro sponge offerings).,-1
16073,16073,5f6c3474220a4650ffffdbc7,An old and a new sheet of table tennis rubber tested: Outlaw,Perhaps if you don't brush the ball the actual grippiness of the surface is less important.,-1

16079,16079,5f6c3474220a4650ffffdbc7,An old and a new sheet of table tennis rubber tested: Outlaw,The ironic thing for me was how one person preferred the new sheet and another the old - so an older rubber could well suit some but not others.,-1

16083,16083,5f6c3474220a4650ffffdbc7,An old and a new sheet of table tennis rubber tested: Outlaw,Before filming I would have expected most rubbers to get harder and possibly sponges too so for it to go softer and for it to be confirmed - however small was a surprise.,-1
16084,16084,5f6c3474220a4650ffffdbc7,An old and a new sheet of table tennis rubber tested: Outlaw,Maybe we should start sending pieces of old rubber - along with age and use details to haggisv so he can build up a sponge hardness table for older as well as new rubbers.,-1

16141,16141,5f6c3481220a4650ffffdbce,Pryde 30 and 40,I've already ordered my Pryde 30 so it's too late (and too expensive) to change my mind...I hope it suits my game more than it did yours.I've at least got a very fast blade...which hopefully should help...but surprised you couldn't get much spin when Pryde 30 is supposed to be a spin monster...,-1

16984,16984,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,from RITC.The problem with tensors is that they are way to springy and therefore you cannot generate enough underspin.You see the same problem when returning serves with tensors the ball jumps instead of sways away from the rubber.I myself have switched from soft tensor rubbers to hars tensor rubbers.I have switched from silver to Tenergy in FH and Platin in BH.Tenergy is on the other hand very spinny both extremely hard and fast and therefore it might be impossible to control as a chopper.They do only sell Tenergy to very good players since it is hard to control this hard rubber in the bh.Platin is also medium hard and also very fast it will be way to fast to control in the bh for chopping - that`s why you could not get any soin from it the contact time is very short for this rubber.Both these rubbers are attackers rubbers not choppers.What do you play at the moment ?,-1

17087,17087,5f6c36a3220a4650ffffdd25,Current Fastest Tacky Rubber (Chinese and Non),'Catch and loop' works well with a very hard and stiff blade (tipical carbon ones) that allows you to sink the ball in the sponge.,-1

17093,17093,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I recently bought a sheet of 2mm Yasaka pryde for my forehand and tried in on Yasaka Malin Carbon and Extra blade and ultimately chose to put on the Extra blade.,-1
17094,17094,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I had some adjusting to do since I was using 999N (unglued) and the rubber characteristics are quite different.Basic Characteristics:-------------------------Very bouncy even on Extra and very loud noise during rallying.,-1
17095,17095,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,The control on the setup is very good in blocking and hitting.,-1
17096,17096,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Everyone who tried it said it had great control with on the MLC.Using MLC countering at mid distance was effortless but I opted to use it on Extra because of better control on my backhand for my RPB using V-Stage.,-1
17097,17097,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,With the Extra you really have to swing to get decent speed.To get most out of this rubber you have to take full swings or the ball is liable to fly off the table (you will get great control).,-1
17098,17098,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I found I could use the same stroke I used for 999N for Pryde.,-1
17099,17099,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,The sponge is not that soft so it can handle the hits.I still need to figure out how to use it for attacking heavy chops if you don't hit it actively the spin bites into the grippy rubber and then it goes into the net.,-1
17100,17100,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,This rubber is not good if you are tentative.,-1
17101,17101,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,So far it's pretty good for serving as its topsheet is quite grippy.I would highly recommend it as it is fun to play with and it complements my 999N very well.Ted,-1
17102,17102,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Thanks for the reply.,-1
17103,17103,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,A few more questions though.,-1
17104,17104,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Is Pryde a light rubber as I considered it in max thickness.,-1
17105,17105,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Also how does it compare to V-Stage in speed and spin qualities?,-1
17106,17106,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,"fusion is similar to mark V ad, bit a bit faster and a bit less spinny.",-1
17107,17107,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,If I am to describe V-Stage it seems more like a super Mark-V in character and when you bounce the ball on the racket it doesn't feel that different and and not much faster.,-1
17108,17108,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I tried V-Stage for few strokes on my forehand but it didn't strike me very much.,-1
17109,17109,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Perhaps I should have tried it more but I liked it best on my BH rpb because the stroke tends to be compact and fast and it fits well with it.,-1
17110,17110,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,"Also, the control is good (on Yasaka Extra blade).",-1
17111,17111,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,If you don't put much into it I feel you won't get much spin so it's a rubber which requires an active stroke preferably with some wrist thrown in.The Yasaka pryde is lot bouncier and seem to be grippier at low speeds whereas V-Stage grippiness kicks in at high speed.,-1
17112,17112,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I have a sweeping full stroke and pryde fit in better.,-1
17113,17113,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I found the control to be good even with full swings.,-1
17114,17114,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,For mid distance rallies I found that I had to open up the face of the racket to drive the ball with sufficient speed.,-1
17115,17115,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,My 999 National has more gears but it's lot more work to use.,-1
17116,17116,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Pryde 2.0 mm is plenty fast with good control.When it comes to 2.5 mm to 2.0 mm if you have a good fh stroke you can generate plenty of speed and I was using Extra which is all+.,-1
17117,17117,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I would think it may be more difficult to deal with service return with 2.5 mm rubber.,-1
17118,17118,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,"I had trouble dealing with heavy chops with the pryde I found unless you hit it so it drives into the rubber, and contact the wood, the ball will go into the net, because it is so grippy.I think they have to be matched to a suitable blade..",-1
17119,17119,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Thanks for that very informative response.,-1
17120,17120,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I also know that Pryde is made in Germany.,-1
17121,17121,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I hope it is somewhat durable as I have not had very good luck with German made rubber sheets in the past.,-1
17122,17122,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I think you have sold me on the 2.0 mm sponge as being fast enough and with good control.,-1
17123,17123,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I am a two winged shakehand looper so I probably will go with Pryde on the forehand but not sure which Yasaka rubber to use on the backhand?,-1

17126,17126,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I may also consider Mendo MP as its durable and it has good speed and spin along with nice touch.......,-1
17127,17127,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,"I hope pryde will be durable .When it comes to the backhand it think it would depend on your stroke, how fast and compact it is, what direction you want to head, and what type of blade you use.",-1
17128,17128,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I use Yasaka Extra blade (all+) so I can get away using V-Stage for my backhand because I like to swing hard and the blade has great feel.,-1
17129,17129,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,"If I had a fast blade V-Stage may not have been a good choice for me.All I can say is for me both XS, V-Stage work well; but XS would be better to improve consistency first because you can't rely on the soft rubber to correct stroke inefficiencies and it's not too fast.",-1
17130,17130,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Moving to faster rubber like V-Stage is a pleasant bonus afterwards provided it is matched with a appropriate blade.,-1
17131,17131,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,I am not sure about the GPS rubber I would imagine it would run out of steam without the glue.,-1

17133,17133,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,"If that is true then I may stick with Japanese made sheets like Mark V, V Stage, Mendo MP, Hammond, etc.",-1

17135,17135,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,Mark V XS is made in China and I have not had much luck with Chinese made sheets...but maybe this one is different?,-1
17136,17136,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,it's made in china?I thought it was made in japan...I remember reading somewhere that M2 (or it might have been XS) plays like an old sheet of VStage.,-1
17137,17137,5f6c36ae220a4650ffffdd2c,Yasaka Pryde and Fusion,V-Stage is noticeably faster than a Mark V-XS and is a low throw rubber.I'll see how long pryde lasts I play 3 times a week and spend quite a bit of time practicing drills so the rubber gets a good workout.,-1

17686,17686,5f6c381a220a4650ffffde09,Compare Black glued Globe999Nat and Black glued SP transcend,Thanks for that Alex...now I am stewing over the pimple rubber to get...here is what I put in another thread...lol..an answer anywhere would be great...============I am in the process of deciding what rubbers to get for a new bat I am building..I am looking for ideas for an OX rubber...It must be Deceptive and have high pimple effect including great spin reversal for a close to the table game...lol...don't want much do I...I was going to use what I have already on my No.,-1
17687,17687,5f6c381a220a4650ffffde09,Compare Black glued Globe999Nat and Black glued SP transcend,"1 bat and that is to get another red Neptune OX, but I just wonder if there is a more deceptive rubber for pimple effect and spin reversal out there...I can tell you if I had a choice of 3 rubbers in total I would have decided by now...but because there are so many excellent choices, I am in a bit of a quandary..Hope to see some answers when I get up in the morning...its 1.10 am here.fosss================",-1
17688,17688,5f6c3825220a4650ffffde10,Differences between Black Globe999Nat and Black Geospin tack,"Well, I will answer this one myself...I Falco Tempo'd the Globe999Nat today and the consensus of opinion from my practice partners tonight was that the rubber was spinnier and faster than my Black Geospin Tacky...which is exactly what I was hoping for..Also the Globe sponge has softened considerably after the Falco treatment...The tackiness was about the same...",-1
17689,17689,5f6c3825220a4650ffffde10,Differences between Black Globe999Nat and Black Geospin tack,I use Spinmax on both rubbers....and they will both hold a ball for a while.I had no trouble at all adjusting to the new rubber.fosss,-1
17690,17690,5f6c3825220a4650ffffde10,Differences between Black Globe999Nat and Black Geospin tack,"Sorry, I only just noticed this thread... yes I agree, the Globe is considarably faster, and equally spinny if not spinnier...Good to hear the sponge softened well ofter the Falco, perhaps the 3rd coat did the trick.",-1

17692,17692,5f6c3825220a4650ffffde10,Differences between Black Globe999Nat and Black Geospin tack,"Yes...Well this gluing is all new territory for me...I have Ecolod many times before but I have never had the softness with Ecolo sponges that Falco gives with the Globe rubber and the F3 rubberre the softness...I am not sure what to expect, as I have never glued before..only Ecolod...but with the Falco'd Globe999Nat sponge, I can press hard with my thumb and a slight indentation remains for for at least a 1/2 minute...very strange but it does return to normal after a while...A ball would never have the force or duration of a hard thumb push, but I cannot help but think that this third layer of Falco may have actually slowed the rubber down...but that does not concern me actually..I am more concerned with spin for my game...If you do a smash shot with any rubber it will go hard and fast...perhaps the softness will help direct the ball to the table, instead of pinging off to anywhere but the table...anyway, I will know soon enough...I will take 3 bats with me in case the Globe is uncontrollable...but I imagine that it will be just what I wantI have Falco'd the Ecolod F3 and it definitely is softer to a hard thumb push, but no indent remains for any length of timeas far as tackiness goes...I would give it to the Globe by a few seconds...about 1/3 as long again...Then again...spininess is not directly related to Tackiness, ...the fact that the globe compresses with the soft sponge must mean that it grabs around the ball and creates more spin that way...I have not had a hit with it since I put the third layer on...It could be a spin MONSTERLOL...Ha!!",-1
17693,17693,5f6c3825220a4650ffffde10,Differences between Black Globe999Nat and Black Geospin tack,"!As a matter of interest...I have just this minute pulled off the black Geospin that was Ecoloe'd about 3 weeks ago, and there was no dome remaining at all...in fact there was a slight reverse dome...I am going to try Falcoing it with the old glue remaining, remembering that the rubber was previously Ecolo'd..I will report here what happens to the Geospin...fosssfosss",-1

17696,17696,5f6c3825220a4650ffffde10,Differences between Black Globe999Nat and Black Geospin tack,"Yes Alex...I am only just realising the finer points of what happens with glueing.Re the Falcoing of the Geospin Rubber.I again placed the rubber in the warmed air (about 38 - 40 deg C) that comes from the ventilation at the back of the Plasma TV...may as well make use of all that power that the plasma uses...lol.I have noted that after about 1/2 an hour after applying Falco, the Geospins reverse dome has been made to a normal dome of about the size you would get from 1 day of Ecolo.fosss",-1
