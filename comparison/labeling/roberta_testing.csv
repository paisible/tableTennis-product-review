1147,The nearest I've tried to the Barracuda was the Genius Sound and didn't like it.,0
4358,If you are still interested in the comparison Omega IV Pro is faster and spinnier than all Hexers.,0
3569,The allround version should be 10g lighter.,3
257,MX-S is a hard low-throw rubber similar to the best Chinese ones.,1
575,"They also offer a variety of more ""Euro"" feel rubbers which I have no experience with.All Chinese rubbers should be within $20-$25 price range so shouldn't become an expensive experiment.",4

418,"At the high end both were close, but below that T05 created more spin more easily.",2
1435,"I was going to put a review on, as above it is white sponge and very soft I'd say.",4
1052,I'm not sure why Yogi says mxp is more durable.,0
1123,It feels hard when it starts but it gets softer and the topsheet is very very grippy.,0
4039,"I love tabletennisdb, but no one's reviews this rubber.",0
4099,"I just find Rasant ""less not good"" .I also perceive it makes more spin than T05 when playing against them.",1

928,"Baracuda gives more spin on lower-effort shots though, which makes it more spin sensitive as well, as you've mentioned.",2

639,"Unfortunately it is due to technique... it does not matter what the throw of the rubber is, you just need to adjust for it, and the ball will go over the net.",0

1925,Target National is £20 from eaching's ebay store (free shipping),0
2660,However as he advanced in years he moved to primorac off- to gain some speed.,0
576,-Has more Spin potential (especially at harder shots); H3 seems to be generally spinnier in low input shots.,2

58,Just the pimple construction is different.,0

754,I second Ziv's suggestion of the Focus III Snipe...,0
1500,There are a ton of fast spinny tensors that are great for looping and fast drives but not so many that will excel equally at chopping and short play.,0
4037,thanks glennholder!,0
577,-Is a bit slower overall but has a higher ceiling for bottoming out this potentially can be faster/spinnier with the right stroke.,2
506,"After 3.5 hours of play, I tried again and then it held for like 1 - 3 sec.",0
3598,"I just want to warn you, I started out using a off blade and fast rubber.",0

2200,if you have 2 blades then why not have T64 on 1 and 05fx on the other?,0
950,"On the other hand, if you like trying different things, then try different things (at least, up to the point you can comfortably justify the expense).",0
2591,No I don't.,0
3580,"More speed, spin and lower throw.",4
449,How do you know that OP does not like the same feeling as you?,0
2605,Your best bet is omega V pro by the sounds of it.,0
187,if you want to play close T05 if much better.,2
4175,I will report later how that goes.,0
4125,Rasant certainly appears to be good value for money.btw - I'm not a regular Tenergy user.,0

2117,Just get the cheaper one lol.,0
93,"If you like to push and spin aggressively, the T05 reaction is a benefit.",3
4100,"That could be just because I'm so used to playing against T05.. then again I see balls coming off Rasant do some very strange things at times on the bounce that I haven't seen happen since speed glued 38mm balls so I'm sure it's making a lot of spin.One thing is that Rasant is harder to control than T05 because it's bouncier and faster, Bluefire is just slightly different to Rasant, not different enough to write the story twice",1
1295,Hurricane 8 is harder and Hurricane 3-50 is softer.,1
1051,Try rakza 7 soft,0
515,Thank you for the information about the various Gambler sponges and where they sit in relation to each other w.r.t hardness.,0
501,I have them trout several different classes of equipment and rubbers and sponge hardness and can see quickly the improvement or degrade in quality.,0
299,"Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade.",3
313,Anything that's not too hard or too soft will work for your needs just fine.,0
1375,"Hmmm, I dont want any defensive rubber because I tried Vs>401 and Marder (I or II) and both were playing wrong for me.",0
444,You just hand them a stack of sheets in a box.,0
2627,"I would consider the Omega V to have high throw, almost as high as Tenergy 05.",1
834,"I honestly can't tell the difference - and to be honest most Chinese sheets (bar, say, Hurricane III and Ckylin) are almost indistinguishable from each other anyway.",0
2049,"Before anyone compare you should tell what ""improvements"" or different qualities you want in your rubber.",0

3584,Vladimr,0
585,"Of the rubbers you mention, I would go with Vega Japan, which I have used on a ""Clipper-like"" blade.",3
460,"Maybe it is better, I mean, so many people can't be wrong (  ) but here's a challenge - buy two sheets, both black, same sponge thickness and hardness, mount them on the same blade, and tell us if you (or your club mates) can tell the difference (cover up the sponge with wide edge tape if necessary).",0
884,Does this LOOK LIKE a $30 rubber?????,0
3338,Using normal glue it should be fine.,0
496,There used to be all sorts of guides to tell you how to tell real from fake National H3.,0
2962,Having never played with either I am not much help.,0

965,"They don't look fresh, somewhat stained, but still generate tons of spin, and are not crumbling away at the edges.",4
1384,you can punch the balls with a lower arc and if pressured you dont have to close your bat angle as much.,4
666,Not sure about that.,0
353,and i'm in square one again probably I will choose el-p as it's quite a bit cheaper in a place when I'm going to buy that rubber from.,0
1797,So you need to give the rubber lots of time and yourself more practice playing with it.,0
1372,Easier to use it defensively than other offensive rubbers.,4
4189,I am guessing that I would prefer M1 but haven't tried it yet and don't have plans anytime soon.,0

1363,Their price is not bad (there is sale in my shop- you get free Tibhar Evo t-shirt for buying rubber  )and quality is very high that's why I think about this series.,0

1787,"The boosting effect is quite mild, and it loses a little over time, which you'll probably hardly notice and it stays perfectly playable.",0
598,I agree with your assessment that since I'm a novice-intermediate player I may not be able to handle the hard sponge; that is the very concern I have.,0
288,it surprises me that Ten05 is less durable(price) and less spinny then the Baracuda.,1

490,"However, they should be able to guide you if you call them up.",0
948,may u give me a short comparison between it and g1/bara please.,0

1930,"However, the good thing about Rising Dragon is that it is much controllable than chinese rubbers.",1
423,If we want to use Chinese classic sponge we do full swing shots to bend that hard sponge and make it work.,0
1136,I’m excited to try it once my sheet of R7 on the Bh is done!,0
3662,Before that I had hexer on the backhand which is supposed to be the same rubber with a different name to baracuda and hexer was spinnier than s2.,1
1765,"Yeah, I could tell one was softer than the other but when it came to actual playing it didn't make much difference.",0
779,"uncut... Could not weigh, just the rubber, post cutting, since it's glued to the blade, and then cut.",0

1095,no.,0
1387,I am surprised by the issues you had with H8.,0
622,"Hey man,",0
2013,But DHS marketing changed gear about 2000AD and rubbers like 999 and 729 took a back seat.,0
925,"Second, if anything, they're just a tiny bit slower than the ""generic"" Palio Emperor Dragon I have on another blade, and just a tiny bit harder than the Tin Arc 5 I have on the other side of that blade.",2
530,"So you're right, blue diamond is the softest sponge they offer.",0
4009,I agree with RR.,0

1934,I'll keep you posted what i think of the replacement in a couple of weeks.,0

3595,Is that Blue sponge so diffent from regular orange neos?,0
1895,"Control is up another notch and blocking and pushing are nice and easy.Am I right in thinking that a rubber with a higher throw angle would help with this or would it put me back to the original problem of over hitting the table.Obviously practice, practice and more practice will improve most points within the game which I feel are improving all the time but I still keep clipping the top of the net way too often.",0
620,"I have kind of a problem returning very spiny servers, probably my technique fault, but could chinese rubber make it even more difficult?",0
393,It does not have the Catapult effect but i can loop an underspin serve easily and the soft sponge gives you enough dwell time and it quite forgiving,4
2644,Yes manufacturer ratings are pretty useless for comparing rubbers between 2 different brands.,0
