34|5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883|t05 being less spinny than GA 8 seems a bit unlikely to me, having tried both.|Butterfly-Tenergy-05|DHS-Gold-Arc-8|spin|l
35|5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883|However, you might find it easier to generate spin with GA 8, while t05 has a higher maximum that not everybody can activate.|Butterfly-Tenergy-05|DHS-Gold-Arc-8|throw angle|g

50|5f687487f57afe037caed0e4|As for the comparison of Baracuda to Genius, they are pretty close siblings from the same generation, but I found the Baracuda a bit easier to play (softer topsheet/sponge).|Donic-Baracuda|Tibhar-Genius|hardness|l

52|5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482|I would use the EL-P as its softer.|Tibhar-Evolution-EL-P|Tibhar-Evolution-EL-S|hardness|l

64|5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf|Also you couldgo for fx-s instead of el-s for more control and less power.|Tibhar-Evolution-EL-S|Tibhar-Evolution-FX-S|control|g
65|5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1|i say the speed is almost the same but with a higher arc on the mx-s. overall, i like the mxs better because it is a well balanced rubber in terms of control and speed and it has this vicious spin potential that is greater than the genesis m. also, it is not as sensitive to incoming spin.|Stiga-Genesis-M|Tibhar-Evolution-MX-S|throw angle|g

70|5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514|When compared H3 neo and H8, the H8 is slightly softer and has less tackiness so that's mean less spinny than H3 neo and also that means it gives you a bit more of control when playing even if you just start to use it|DHS-Hurricane-3|DHS-Hurricane-8|spin|g

660|5f71255ffda380972b4f89f6|I made the switch from 2.0mm x2 MXP to 2.0mm x2 ELS primarily due to the weight because MXP still feels heavy at times.ELS feels much less spin sensitive compared to MXP and makes it easier to control in the short game.|Tibhar-Evolution-EL-S|Tibhar-Evolution-MX-P|spin|g

667|5f71255ffda380972b4f89f6|I would rate as medium; MXP has quite higher throw.IÂ´ll give a few sessions more but honestly iÂ´m not fully convinced with it as a FH rubber, since i can loop effordless with MXP and produce more deadly shots in spite of the lack of control compared to ELS, which imo needs to engage to a bit more sponge/topsheet.|Tibhar-Evolution-EL-S|Tibhar-Evolution-MX-P|throw angle|l
