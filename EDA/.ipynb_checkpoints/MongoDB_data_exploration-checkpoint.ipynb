       "[[\"Hi stao, the response of the T64fx changes depending on the the blade you're using. Usually I have a Primorac Carbon and I'm offensive player with agressive top spin. I used T05fx before and I really appreciate the general feeling of the T64fx, which is more softer but faster than 05fx. On the other hand less spin too. Very good for block. For my style I really prefer T64fx than T05fx ( always 2.1 for me).I bought recently the complete Garaydia family to see if from the blade I had a possibility to improve my skills and I would say no.With the ALC it is too soft and slow for me, with the T5000 too fast and the ZLC has a softer touch and could be an alternative. I'm truly amazed about the huge difference between those 3 blades.To finish I'm currently glueing a Dignics 05 on my Primorac carbon to test as the season ended. after a training I'll see if it fits for me or if I have to test it with the garaydia T5000 or Garaydia ZLC as I'm seeking more spin...\"],\n",
