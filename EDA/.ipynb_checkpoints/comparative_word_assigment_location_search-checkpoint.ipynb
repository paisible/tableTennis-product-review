      "If you got something like a Primorac Off- or a Petr Korbel and used it with the same rubbers for a while, once you got your touch back you can just go back to the old blade and it won't be much of an adjustment because you were using the same rubbers on a blade that is slower with more control.\n",

      "To my eyes the rhyzer had more spin with harder/medium strokes and a more linear arc (but still safe arc to go over the net consistently) compared to the 05 & rhyzm -P. Rhyzer 43 was faster than T05 & J-P and the rhyzer 43 is on a slow blade being joola chen defender compared to the butterfly zlc blade & the other one was hinoki wood composition but i forget what it was.\n",
      "Having just wasted £40 on a sheet of red Rhyzer 43 2.0mm I have say that as a result of the very thin top sheet and high catapult sponge this is a rubber you will love or hate depending on your playing style.If you stand back from the table and topspin or fast block everything with good modern short stroke technique it is great, but for a close to the table push,block hit type game not so great.\n",
      "The biggest problem to me is the total lack of feel and precision due to the very thin and soft top sheet and the high catapult from the fast medium soft sponge coming into play much earlier than say on the latest Tibhar Evolution or Aurus series Rubbers.\n",
      "I have switched it to the slower back hand side of my Black & White blade but still plenty fast for aggressive close to table forehand play.\n",
      "The extra dwell of the slow side makes easier to spin up the ball and gives more control on blocks, whilst the fast sponge still gives lots of speed when needed.3.\n",

      "However, in all \"sub-optimal strokes\" some rubbers can generate more speed/spin.\n",
      "Yes, they have more powerful spin and speedier when they hit it right.\n",
      "Table tennis is a game of spin, speed and control.\n",
      "I like that T05 pushes over the table are flat and spinny and gives you a decent serve return that sometimes causes opponent to net if you push fast enough,bear in mind this is one of the highest/arcing throw rubbers so the best of both worlds,even on my thin flex def blade,+longer lasting than most factory boosted rubbers so the extra cost evens out somewhat in the long runI also tried Dignics 05 and for me was inferior to T05 on all shots,serve return in particular where the ball was way too high and I couldn't find a way with it,maybe I'm too used to the t05 where everything seems to work on autopilot for me.\n",
      "Thus, they can manage to tame the fastest rubber available.\n",
      "They don't just go for the fastest.\n",
      "I was surprised at the poor boosting results I got with Dignics 05,the result with Falco long was very little expansion of the rubber and little to no improvement in the game,why are you boosting some might ask?my blade is slow and perfect for the ox pips and needs something with extra kick for effective f/h attack,same amount of booster gets a good result with T05\n",

      "MX-S is a fast offensive rubber.\n",
      "Chopping is spiny and easier then with other modern catapult rubbers but you need a solid technique to tame its speed even with minimal sponge thickness.\n",
      "That would save you a lot of trouble right away, but we are curious cats.Unless you have a fast bat and the stroke to get the ball into the rubber and sponge, you will not get everything you could get out of MX-S.\n",
      "That is just me, you should discover your own sweet spots.I goof off and chop a lot at the club, although I am an attacking player with some all-round tendencies.Unless you are facing monster-man massive loops from really hard hitting advanced players (that would require a softer sponged slower inverted rubber), you can adjust and chop with the inverted rubber you like for offense with high consistency... and given the time, high quality.\n",
      "Extreme short description.Overall, a faster rubber with control and high possible spin.Low to medium impacts - totally linear (like Karis) - you get out exactly what you put in.\n",

      "I think a relatively harder faster rubber will compensate for the slower blade.\n",
      "The answer is going to depend on how much power/speed you want to have, you can loop with soft thinner sponge, it won't be the same as with thicker sponge since it will bottom out easier.\n",

      "I don't really like SPs much.My post is on Moristo DEF, the inverted rubber.For me it has been a great discovery.At present I am playing in 1.2 mm and I can defend and attack consistently.Plenty of spin on serves when needed, great control in chops and blocks.With Grubba all + I have enough speed to attack with quality and safely.Of course, my set up is not a rocket but the control with good speed is there .\n",
      "From what I have read online, including on Coach EmRatThich's site (https://pingsunday.com/dhs-hurricane-3- ... rricane%27), the blue sponge is harder and faster.\n",

      "Very low arc.On the backhand I use Omega IV Europe----- quite a high throw,completely different rubber from the above.I have tried Sigma Pro---- it grips the ball very well with a lower throw than Omega.Sigma 2----- I believe from having a quick hit with it,is the opposite to Sigma 1 in that it has a high throw with excellent dwell time but slightly slower.I get very confused with the rubbers coming out with the similar name and play differently.\n",

      "For someone who has had little or no coaching you seem to be putting the effort into looking at how to improve.If you're dissatisfied with your FH rubber (I've no experience of jpen) you could consider sticking with the same rubber in a not so soft version - the Vega Europe.The Baracuda I wouldn't recommend - it's essentially an old rubber but for the Spin & Speed it gives it's not great on control.Genius Sound I know nothing about but it's rated at 37.5 degree compared to the 42.5 degree of the Baracuda.\n",
      "I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control.\n",
      "So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before.\n",

      "It is a touch too fast especially on a carbon blade and needs solid technique.\n",
      "The throw while blocking is low which is great and it is relatively insensitive to incoming spin.You could think of it as a Hexer HD with a touch softer and grippier topsheet, a softer sponge , more speed and spin.Like HD you really have to get some bat speed going and engage the sponge is you want that crazy spin.I use OIV Pro on my BH in max thickness.\n",

      "Never played with it, but someone I played last week used it on their FH and the speed of their loops compared to what they previously used (don't recall what that was) was highly pronounced.\n",
      "The way you describe it, it sounds as if it's just what i' m looking for then.Better spin, better control, but as fast as 450.My spinny serves are an essential part of my game, and if I can generate more spin, it sounds like a very good alternative.\n",
      "But it is a lot harder isn't it?With roxon 450 i've had max on fh and one step slower on bh, so that would probably be a good idea on rasant as well?\n",

      "In the short game the Donic clearly outperformed, as the Calibra is much more bouncy making it harder to keep the ball low.Serving was very good with both...both generate heavy spin easily, although with the Donic it's a little easier to serve slower balls and probably a little easier to generate the spin.If I had to chose, I'd personally choose the Calibra, but that depends on your own game.\n",

      "H2 Neo starts out tacky but it mostly wears off after 5-6 matches and the speed increases as the tackiness decreases.\n",
      "Faster and harder than H2 Neo, TG3 Neo is even tackier and seems to have somewhat higher throw, and noticeably more spin on serve.My experience with Palio Thors is mixed.\n",
      "The broken in Thors was, hands down, the best blocking rubber I had ever used: Effortless high-speed blocks off of blistering incoming drives had me instantly grinning.\n",
      "Linearity was fine, and speed and spin were great.\n",
      "You can play well with H2 neo or Thors but they are fairly different rubbers and like nathanso said regarding Thors changing with age the difference between them grows with age, the H2 neo will get slower, Thors will get faster.\n",
      "A brand new Thors is still faster than H2 neo will ever be and more spinny but once it's got 30, 40 maybe 50 hours on it, then it's quite fast and also very lively.\n",
      "The only time you can ever slightly bottom Thors is counter hitting a very well hit ball as hard as you can, I doubt more than 1% of the table tennis population can achieve that kind of speed, it happens a long time after T05 or any of the other famous tensors, when it does happen you can see the ball fly straighter than usual, normally it ends in a long ball even from full court.\n",
      "I used Thors for 6 months plus and liked it, but now I have a coach and he has changed my playing style from driving hard/fast loops to a controlled spinning game on my FH.\n",

      "I would assume (without having tried them) that Nimbus would be quite a bit faster than both of those.\n",
      "will it be fast enough if I mix in some looping?\n",
      "Because the balsa rebounds the ball much faster when you hit it harder, the dwell time will be lower on powerloops so you'll likely get less spin.\n",

      "Had my first hit with Black 2.0mm Venus (BH) and Red 2.0mm Jupiter (FH) last night.Both felt a little slow - to be expected since the tackiness won't wear out for a while.Venus - I found Venus to be a very good all-round rubber, consistent for chopping and blocking which makes it perfect for my backhand.Jupiter - I had about 10 serves go into the edge of the table last night (all of them topspin serves) so will have to get used to serving.\n",

      "Coming from mainly Chinese rubbers, I've used to having to generate my own pace instead of getting a lot from the rubber, and the speed was quite good, easily faster than many Chinese rubbers, and probably only a little slower than t05.\n",

      "The outlaw and hurricane neo are much faster maybe 20% more but have less grip or hardly any.\n",
      "I think i might throw in another side of the story  In order to switch from defensive to offensive gamestyle you need to go too a slower (5 layers without carbon) in order to inprove your skills.The problem with carbon blades is the they are very stiff and hard and therefore they offer very short dwell tim eand thereby control - when you have to change style it is too difficult to learn the strokes if the blade is too slow.\n",

      "Obviously this is all relative but the best chopping rubber hands down is the Geo Spin Tacky.If you have a faster blade then go with the 1.5mm thick otherwise stick with the 2.0mm.\n",
      "The 1.5 is really a lot slower than the 2.0, but would be more controlled.GST gives you the impression you are totally in control when chopping, and the amount of spin you can produce is quite amazing.\n",
      "Tenergy 05 does provide insane spin, but it is a fast rubber and even 1.7 can be too bouncy.The soft rubbers like Reforma are going to feel great for chopping but then on power drives and kill balls, they loose so much energy.\n",
      "This applies to tacky rubbers as well, but they tend to have hard sponges which helps to speed smashes up.Geospin Tacky or Transcend SP are good choices.Again, Macro Era is a tensor made for offensive play so it doesn't really fit in with chopping.If you're mainly chopping, I would go for something which suits chopping.\n",
      "I would not go any thicker as it might be too fast\n",
      "The issue with a rubber for chopping is that it doesn't want to be too fast or bouncy otherwise the ball is gone before you get much chance to inflict any great degree of spin on it.\n",

      "Normally contrast is between a faster hitting/looping rubber on FH and pips on BH.\n",
      "Straight 729 is fairly slow and very tacky in its own right, so in a thinner sponge it would make a very cheap inverted chopping option.\n",

      "Yes a faster ball has higher momentum, but the momentum is horizontal so it's irrelevant when looking at how quickly the ball will drop.Given two balls with equal rpms and different speeds, the faster ball definitely has a sharper arc, as the force of air resulting from spin is more than gravity.\n",

      "It's also quite fast and an absolute monster for looping.\n",
      "The black is a bit tackier, and thus spinnier, while the red is a bit speedier due to the minorly reduced tack.\n",
      "potential speed is also higher for 729.it has a cream coloured sponge (dunno what kind of sponge it is)if u ask me which do i prefer, it would be the 729-2. it feels like a better matchup wz the H.King.i'm happy wz the increase in power.\n",
      "The 729-3 is much less tacky, and quite a fast rubber.\n",
      "I think the 729 transcend will be slower than the H3, as it's the original 729 topsheet on the new transcend sponge.... it should be tackier too as the H3 is not really that tacky.\n",
      "Something that plays similar but with more dynamic and speed?\n",
      "Without tuning, it is a little slower than Energy.\n",
      "Interesting, as far as I know the 36-38deg is the softest available... are you sure it's 35deg, or is it a different sponge?I use spinmax, so keeping it tacky won't be an issue.I have not tried many euro rubbers glued up, and the venus tuned with Falco booster is certainly faster than any unglued rubber when you start looping.. the tack slows it down in the slower parts of the game...\n",
      "Hi Hookshot...I have LKT Pro XT which is a tacky rubber as the name says..(XT = extra tacky) and that has remained tackier than it was new for 3 - 4 months now with Spinmax, and an occasional treatment of Eucalyptus Oil and a stint in the sun or under a light for 2 hours brings up that glossy tack that I cannot live without...lol....Its quite dramatic what the EO does and the rubbers just slurp it up...apart from helping maintain tackiness, this EO treatment causes the topsheet to become tuned...Ie the increased size makes the topsheet more dense and adds speed..Anyway, it might not be a bad idea to get some Spinmax Aqueous from Alex...it would be there before you know it, and also try the EO in the sunlight if your sun is warm, or 100 watt light globe at about 12 inches ...watch the heat.I gave a sheet of Mercury (Venus's sister rubber with a Chinese sponge) to a friend a few weeks ago, and he has maintained the rubber tackier than it was at new using the above treatment regime...I do realise I sound a bit like a broken record going on about Spinmax and EO,  but the fact is that they work!!\n",
      "It felt great for looping--tons on speed and spin--but I couldn't chop worth a damn with it...\n",
      "I do find that in 2.0mm it bottoms out a little, only in fast counterloops away from the table...of course the fact that it's only 2.0mm has a lot to do with this...\n",
      "Compared to the 999 Nat, the venus is much more controllable, except the 999 Nat gets a bit more spin, it's a little easier to do real slow spinny loops (as the 999 topsheet is softer) and and it never bottoms out...\n",
      "I have tried some Palio and New Era 50 degree rubbers in the past and they are REALLY fast, as with compared to with Tensors!!!\n",
      "What's their speed like, about the speed of Bryce/Hammond (unglued)?\n",
      "The slowest Plasma (ie the 380) is faster.\n",
      "The JOGold has a slightly softer and grippier topsheet IIRC.Meaning it's a bit easier to slow loop with.\n",
      "They are faster, clickier, more lively but lack the bite of Chinese/Japanese rubbers.\n",
      "These rubbers sound pretty fast.\n",
      "I was thinking of something with the speed of Bryce/Hammond unglued (so only moderately fast), and with enough power to loop the ball away from table.I imagine all of them have low to med throw?\n",
      "I'd say those hard tensors are maybe 10-15% faster than unglued bryce,hammond at best.\n",
      "Yes, it's a few grams lighter than the chinese rubbers, but much faster and less spinny.If you take speedglue into account, the chinese rubbers will probably be heavier again - requires more glue.\n",
      "It's hard to create very spinny serves, but I found with enough toss height and racket speed it can still be pretty spinny.\n",
      "I disagree, it is not just a matter of speed, the Tensors feel better than unglued Bryce.\n",
      "Ok, well the 470 is lower throw and faster than the JO Gold (which is slightly spinnier, but wears out faster).And I haven't had another hit with the Bryce Speed until recently (due to its high price), but I'm once again certain that BS is as fast, if not faster than 470 and the JO Gold.All tensors bottom out on me...if not, then they behave strangely when you want them in their top gear (like throw and touch all change).\n",
      "playing against LawOCG last Friday has killed yet another sheet of Tango Extrem.If only Bryce Speed costed less and c=doesn't weigh like H3!!!\n",
      "focus 2 is lower throw than sriver L , almost the same speed and is tacky.\n",
      "Some will dissagree with this but I find Venus a perfect replacement for Energy GP except it is a little slower.\n",
      "Yes, I clean them and use protector sheets.I have it on max sponge and use it for an attacking game, loops, loop drives and it has a good slow game also, pushing, blocking.I switched to Venus because of the price of Energy.\n",
      "At the moment because I tend to block and push on the BH, its too fast on that blade for me.\n",
      "The loop is a bit slower than with inverted, and many players mistime it.\n",
      "May be it is still \"chinese\" rubber  .Do yo try focus1 and focus3 and do you use speed gluing or it's replacement?\n"
