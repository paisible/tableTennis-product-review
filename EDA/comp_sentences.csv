0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,"I used T05fx before and I really appreciate the general feeling of the T64fx, which is more softer but faster than 05fx.",1
1,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,On the other hand less spin too.,2
2,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,For my style I really prefer T64fx than T05fx ( always 2.1 for me).,1
3,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"If you loop everything and are active in the short game with spin manipulation, Tenergy 05.",2
4,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"If you block more and are a bit more passive in the short game, the more linear precision of T64 and T80 might be more to your liking.",2
5,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I think T25FX is better than T64 for blocking and short game.,1
6,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I like hard sponge so t05 is my favorite.,2
7,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"The sponge on T05, T80, T64 and T25 is all the same.",1
8,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer.,2
9,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T05 pimples are a little shorter, thicker, and closer together so the rubber feels harder.",2
10,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"1) T05: Slower, More Spin, Higher Throw Angle.",2
11,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"2) T64: Faster, Less Spin, Lower Throw Angle.",2
12,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But T80 is less sensitive to it etc.,2
13,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T80 has a little bit more control (for me), less sensitive to spin, but T05 is spinnier.",1
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Like, for me, hands down, I like T05 more than the others for forehand.",2
15,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"After testing Dignics 05 on a zlc blade after the end of last season I'm back to my primorac carbon this time with T80fx, that's a better combination for me as it gives me what I was looking for, so a bit more spin and control than T64fx.",1
16,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too.,2
17,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks,1
18,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I would suggest t05fx, it is softer more control and less speed, but still not slow.",2
19,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T80 is more suited maybe for close to the table, while T64 can go further back.",1
20,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T05FX is much easier to control and if you take it with 1.9mm, it is great for everything.",2
21,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,if you want to play close T05 if much better.,2
22,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T80 with different dimension of pips makes the ball going higher so it is much better to play further then T05, but I cannot compare it to T64 because I have never try it.",1
23,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,T64 has MUCH more spin than T80â€¦,1
24,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"As to the rubbers if you want to choose Butterfly, you can take T05FX to your BH (you can trust me, it is the best choice from the Bty offer) and then it depends how do you play with you FH, if you play close you can take T05, if you like to play in distance you can take T80.",1
25,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy has a slightly higher throw angle than Baracuda, so looping heavy chops may be a little bit easier, with a greater arc on the ball.",1

38,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,it surprises me that Ten05 is less durable(price) and less spinny then the Baracuda.,1
39,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Yes, it is a little bit shocking since you would expect to get an extremely overpowered rubber for ~$80 a sheet but actually, Baracuda surpasses Tenergy in spin.",1

72,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,Elp would be better if you brush,2

84,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,"I liked GA 8, but I thought it was a bit like Donic bluefire M1.",1
85,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,"However, you might find it easier to generate spin with GA 8, while t05 has a higher maximum that not everybody can activate.",1

94,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-Has lower throw angle and thus smaller margin for error.,2
95,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-Has more Spin potential (especially at harder shots); H3 seems to be generally spinnier in low input shots.,2
96,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-Is a bit slower overall but has a higher ceiling for bottoming out this potentially can be faster/spinnier with the right stroke.,2
97,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-has better feel for me; I can keep my pushes lower and place most shots with more accuracy as long as Iâ€™m taking care of the lower throw.,2
98,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,Therefore I usually played worse with TG2 than with H3.,1

100,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,TG2 is a little bit slower and better control I think.,2
101,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,It gives me a little more control than TG2 and still makes my loops vicious.,2
102,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,DHs H3 Neo is my prefered rubber with H2 Neo being second.,1

112,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,GoldArc should be somewhat spinnier but i like the Mantra M as a bh rubber better because it is not spin sensitive abd it is more bouncy.,1
113,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Much more spin sensitive than Mantra M.,2

125,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,It sounds like you find vega china to be as good as H3.,1
126,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,Omega VII Asia would be a modern tensor rubber that plays completely differently from H3.,1
127,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,"It may be slightly less bouncier and offers somewhat more control than other tensor rubbers, but it would never replace H3.",2
128,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,Because I can control H3 way better.,2
129,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,"Not really, vega asia is softer.",2
130,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,H3 has much better spin (like 2x of b2) and control.,2
131,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,"However when boosted/speed glued properly, B2 Provincial is still playable and is a cheaper alternative than H3P.",1
