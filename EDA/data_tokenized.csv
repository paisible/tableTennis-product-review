166,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too.,-1
167,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks,-1

929,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),baracuda is less durable.,-1
930,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It easily chips at the side of the topsheet.,-1
931,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),so what does this mean for opening up backspin balls with an attack.,-1
932,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),is it easier with the baracuda due to its higher spin on low attack balls or,-1
933,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),is it easier with the fastarc due to the amount of spin which is to override,-1
934,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),This depends on your technique and habits IMO.,-1
935,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I tend to be aggressive when opening up off backspin so they're pretty much as easy as each other, but I got a faster ball with G1.",-1
936,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"On ""softer"" openers, Baracuda seemed to generate a higher arc so it was easier in that sense.",-1
937,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Don't overthink it too much.,-1
938,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),The main difference is that G1 is a bit faster.,-1
939,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Quite similar overall, both good rubbers.",-1
940,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Yogi's point about durability is a good one too.,-1
941,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),for me as a beginner the spin-sensivity is a big factor.,-1
942,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),recieves are a big winning condition.,-1
943,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),if i could have quite a similar rubber like Baracuda but with an improved chance of avoiding recieve errors then i would do the change.,-1
944,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),i choosed the Barauda as my daily rubber because i can do lazy backspin into topspin attack as well as hard shots.,-1
945,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),with H3 and other hard°rubbers i only could do hard shots.,-1
946,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),thus this aspect is also important.,-1
947,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),btw Andy: u choosed R47 as ur primary rubber.,-1
948,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),may u give me a short comparison between it and g1/bara please.,-1
949,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I have a Kid that plays with Baracuda, as he is a chopper, I chose that rubber for him, he can attack very agressively with more spin than the older better players that use M1, or even tenergy, the ball comes really heavy.",-1

953,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),R47 is really different.,-1

955,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Rasanter is more recent - you get a matte topsheet, less catapult, more linearity (and for me, a better feeling of ""grab"" on the plastic ball, but not everyone agrees with that).",-1
956,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Add to that a lower arc and it's a different proposition.,-1
957,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It needs more effort to list backspin for sure.,-1
958,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But I don't like the older ESN rubbers with the plastic ball - otherwise I'd probably be using G1 (in the absence of Adidas P7).,-1

968,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Which is why I think it´s quite funny that over on German TT News some people now treat G1 as the answer to all questions and a serious alternative to tenergy.,-1

977,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I had both VP and Baracuda on same blade.,-1
978,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Baracuda was miles ahead for me.,-1
979,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Don't get the hype of it as a Tenergy clone.,-1
980,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Vega pro is not comparable to baracuda but rather Acuda S2.,-1
981,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I think Sigma 2 pro is closer to baracuda,-1
982,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"In terms of sponge hardness, would the Rasanter R42 be closest to the Baracuda/G1?",-1
983,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"As the name suggests, the R42 has a sponge hardness of 42° on the ESN-scale (I think they use Shore A), whereas the G-1 has a sponge hardness of 47.5°, so that's a rather significant difference.",-1
984,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),The R47 would be closer (if we're only talking about sponge hardness).,-1
985,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yes, absolutely.",-1
986,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),There will never be a good direct comparison between Baracuda and the Rasanter series - the whole rubber composition is just too different.,-1

991,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But they aren't that close.,-1
992,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"IMO R47 is more linear, easier to use, much better blocking and flat hitting, less sensitive to spin.",-1
993,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But it's also lower arc and you have to put your own muscle into the stroke to get good spin out.,-1
994,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It rewards committed strokes with good performance.,-1
995,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"T05 is generally more spinny across a whole range of gears but has all the usual T05 demands - spin sensitivity, catapult, price.",-1

1000,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I presume it's quite good in the short game compared to Tenergy 05?,-1
1001,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),How would the R47 play on a Joo Se Hyuk blade would it suit?,-1

1003,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It's very likely ESN use Asker C, which has a spherical indenter.",-1
1004,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"DHS use Shore A, which has a truncated cone indenter.",-1
1005,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Because of that, simple translation and direct comparison between the 2 scales are prone to error and not recommended.",-1
1006,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Away from the table looping - it's OK.,-1
1007,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Spin is good but from distance you have to pay attention to the arc because it stays lower than some of its peers.,-1
1008,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Counterlooping - excellent.,-1
1009,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's very stable and forgiving of timing/power errors.,-1
1010,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Counter tends to stay low and nasty.,-1

1012,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Close-in - it's solid.,-1
1013,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Great for flicks, close counters, basic drives.",-1
1014,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Because it's a bit inert compared to, say, MX-P, you have to muscle backspin openers a bit more than livelier rubbers.",-1
1015,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Serving is OK but I needed to make some adjustments to get good spin on short serves - needs care to avoid sending the serve into the middle zone.,-1
1016,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Much easier in the short game, blocking, than T05 for me.",-1
1017,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's easier and more predictable in general.,-1
1018,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"But if you're used to T05 and happy with the way it plays, you'd probably find R47 a bit dead and lifeless.",-1
1019,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's all a very personal experience.,-1
1020,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I haven't used a Joo so can't say for sure.,-1
1021,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),If you send me a PM I can send you a gently-used sheet of R47 in black ultramax to try out if you want.,-1
1022,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Might be a bit small for the Joo headsize though.,-1
1023,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Thickness - R47 has the new-ish thin topsheet/thicker sponge concept so plays a bit softer than you might expect with 47.5 hardness.,-1
1024,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I use Ultramax on the FH at the mo and it gives a little more catapult and more headroom when playing harder shots to get spin out of it.,-1
1025,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Thinner sponges (in general, IMO) tend to play a touch harder, less catapulty, more direct, and you sacrifice top-end spin for a little more straight-line speed.",-1

1027,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),These things tend to be very personal impressions and YMMV.,-1
1028,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Best to try it out if you can.,-1
1029,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Only way to be sure!,-1
1030,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"You are correct, zeio.",-1
1031,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),ESN uses C; I mixed it up.,-1

1033,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),is it worth to try out the g1 as baracuda fan?,-1
1034,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"i am afraid that with harder sponge it will be much less comfort in doing all kind of shots well, esp opening up backspin.",-1

1037,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Moving between rubber hardness levels is more difficult than moving between rubber brands/types.,-1
1038,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's a huge difference.,-1
1039,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But you won't know till you try.,-1
1040,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yes, it will be harder to perform shots you rely on, lifting backspin especially will be harder, but on the other hand, if you have the physical power for it, the harder rubbers will perform better and pressure opponents more with more speed and spin.",-1
1041,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"That said, just replacing rubbers isn't a magic spell, you won't get any of that extra speed and spin unless you're fit and have great technique.",-1
1042,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Without all that you'll just have a lot less speed and spin.,-1

1826,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"As for your BH, From what you described above i think Tibhar Evolution MX-S or MX-P would be great and it is similar to Tenergy 05 but doesnt mean its the same as T05..the feelings and touch is of course different from t05 as this is a medium hard rubber and its jus that the spin and speed of this rubber matches and is similar to the t05.",-1
1827,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Most people choose it because it is similar to T05 and is half the price of T05 with much more durability.,-1
1828,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Im currently using Omega V Pro and it is also similar to T05 in my point of view but it is slightly slower and less spinny but it has an incredible good control with high arc that helps to reduce errors or reduce hitting the ball into the net.,-1
1829,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Well it worth the try and im actually liking it.,-1
1830,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"**Also about the H8 and bigger stroke, there is no need to do a bigger stroke with H8 or full body stroke thats just what the chinese pro players does but i wouldnt recommend you to do so the chinese pro players do it because they were trained and used to that playing style but if you do it it will be a disaster because you dont have the reflexes like them, you cant recover for the next shot because you're not used to it and it requires incredible footwork to do so.",-1
1831,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"SO IF YOU WANT TO DO THE FULL BODY STROKES LIKE THE PRO CHINESE PLAYERS, YOU NEED TO WORK REALLY HARD ON YOUR FOOTWORK AND ATHLETICISM***",-1
1832,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"LIKE I TOLD YOU IN MY FIRST POST, you need to provide me with more info on the type of rubber you prefer",-1
1833,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Looking at pro players equipments is good but you should look for whats good for you rather than looking whats the pro uses and try to use it,-1
1834,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"For example: Tenergy, I used tenergy for about 3 months but its not for me",-1
1835,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,The rubber is too soft for me and it is really hard to adapt to these kind of rubber after using harder rubbers,-1
1836,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,You see tenergy is not for everyone.,-1
1837,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,and you requires a lot of skills in order to use it.,-1
1838,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Sorry to say this but i can already imagine you struggling using Tenergy after using a hard rubber on BH because it was the same for me.,-1
1839,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"So, for now, for your BH, if you want a really fast rubber with medium amount of spin go for Stiga rubbers",-1
1840,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Stiga rubbers are really fast but kinda lacks in control but you'll get use to it in a short amount of time,-1
1841,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"If you want a control with medium fast and medium spin, i would say try out Xiom Omega V Pro that im using",-1
1842,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,It would worth your try and check out TTD channel on YouTube and check out their rubber reviews videos,-1
1843,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,or search for reviews on specific rubbers in the equipment reviews i bet that will help you a lot,-1
1844,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Cheers!,-1
1845,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Good Luck!,-1
1846,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,IMO the difference between the two is the technique or approach.,-1
1847,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,If you like to loop the ball hard or spin the table that is H3 on the other hand H8 requires a more relaxed approach and really fine brushing if you loop the ball hard this is where I notice the slippage.,-1
1848,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,The H8's sponge is more active than the H3 so expect it to be bouncier and one thing I noticed is that the H8 is comparable to a H3 provincial especially the higher quality of topsheet and the active sponge.,-1
1849,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Lifting backspin is easy in H3 chinese style stroke and even easier in H8 if you can maximize the tacky topsheet and the active sponge.,-1
1850,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Next week I'm gonna go back to H3 because the H8's slippage on hard shots is really annoying.,-1
1851,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Roger, currently I'm using the stiga infinity vps v which is a wooden blade...I think.",-1
1852,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"On my FH I'm using the H2, which is what I'm mainly looking to upgrade, and the friendship/729 Higher 3 on my backhand which is quite good.",-1
1853,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I was just wondering what other people were using which could influence my decision for a BH rubber in the future.,-1
1854,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Thanks for the detailed reply iamvtwo.,-1
1855,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I did use tenergy 05 on my friend's bat for about 30 mins and tbh I found it really hard to control the trajectory of the ball due to it being very soft.,-1
1856,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,The Tibhar Evolution MX-P and Xiom Omega V Europe looks very interesting.,-1
1857,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I will consider them both in the future when I want to replace my old one.,-1
1858,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"From reading all the comments about H3 neo and H8, I'm starting to lean towards the H3 just due to the precise stroke and technique you have to use (Sometimes my stroke can be off) as well as it sounds like the H3 is more direct in the positioning of shots.",-1
1859,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I have been looking at chinese players equipment because I feel a closer resemblance to their playstyle and I have realised that all have chosen the H3 over the H8 (disregarding different edition like national).,-1

2132,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Baracuda is the most spinny rubber lve used.,-1
2133,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,It is very easy to control during topspin to topspin rallies.,-1
2134,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Very good for controlled looping and you can also hit the ball hard when needed.,-1
2135,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,But the rubber is not that fast and is a little bit soft.,-1

2327,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,The center of these rubbers have the highest quality control because they are the least likely to ripple or become different than the further out you go (Think pie crust when you roll it the center is always perfect but the further out you go it is usually worse) Each rubber is cut and then stamped with the different names and then tuned if necessary.,-1
2328,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"The different degrees of hardness I believe depend on the entire sheet's degree of hardness, but typically the center is always the hardest and the further out you go the less hard it is.",-1

2332,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Provincial players will usually ask for 38 degree or 39 degree which is why they are much more common.,-1
2333,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,This also means they will be boosting a bit less because it is already softer than the more CNT preferred 40 + degrees.,-1

2393,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,1)Dwell time (mostly related to spin but in soft rubbers it creates speed also),-1

2396,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Some physics to understand better,-1
2397,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,There are two forces on the ball a) the tangential one that creates spin b)and the lateral one that creates speed,-1
2398,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Notice that by the term speed we mean horizontal speed not vertical!,-1
2399,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,The actual result of these two forces is that the ball is travelling spinny and speedy creating an arc.,-1
2400,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Lets assume that a table tennis sponge is like a spring .,-1
2401,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Hard springs when compared to softer ones when fully compressed produce more force thus more acceleration (F= K X A , Newton's law) thus more speed, to the object that compresses them.",-1

2403,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Conclusion no1 : When the sponge is hard you need strong hitters to manage to compress the sponge at its full in order to take full advantage of its abilities !,-1
2404,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,To achieve that you need a hard hitter with perfect timing and angle of the racket.,-1

2406,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,That doesnt mean that if you are in good physical condition with fast footwork and good body & wrist rotation (but not a pro player) you cant play effectively with a chinese rubber,-1
2407,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,.,-1
2408,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Conclusion no2 : With softer sponges (the sponge has more ""porosity"") you need less power and have big margin for error in your angle of your strokes to achieve a desired arc (speed&spin).",-1

2410,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Conclusion no3 : Knowing the importance of timing, paddle angle and sponge hardness, underspins lifted with hard rubbers need perfect technique and timing compared to the soft ones.",-1
2411,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"A heavy underspin if lifted with a small error in technique using a soft rubber, maybe will not be lifted (or lifted with less pace & arc) with a hard rubber.",-1

2420,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Read my previous post if you like  It is rather unlikely that the 729 FX produces more spin that the hurricane.,-1
2421,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Maybe you feel that way because it is softer thus giving you more feedback in your palm.,-1
2422,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Of course the fact that you have an OFF+ blade plays an important role in the dwell time of the blade...pre made paddles are very slow compared to custom ones.,-1
2423,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,So they have more dwell time=more spin,-1
