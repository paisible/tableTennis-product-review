54,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,It is the pimple construction.,0
55,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer.,2
56,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T05 pimples are a little shorter, thicker, and closer together so the rubber feels harder.",2

58,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Just the pimple construction is different.,0

72,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Or do you want lower shots that don't come up as much and are faster.,0
73,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But with an amount of spin that is easier to counter.,0
74,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Or do you want to be half way in between the two extremes?,0
75,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I go with slower and more spin every time.,0

87,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I found that t05 is very sensitive to incoming spin and spinny serves.,3

132,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,first one was really powerful,-2
133,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,second one was flexy,-2
134,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,3rd was some where in between,-2
135,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,also i bought a Timoboll ALC and it was so powerful and fast i didn't match what the viscaria's felt like.,-2
136,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,anyway... i sold all my butterfly blades and switched to stiga clippers woods,-2
137,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"the main reason is the butterfly handles are all too small, and thin.",-2
138,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,stiga handles are superior and the clipper has such a sweet feel and power ratio plus the weight of the clipper is what the poly ball is requiring IMHO.,-2
139,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"so yes.. even at the highest level maker of blades, in this case butterfly, all 3 of my viscaria's felt different and i am very critical of my equipment.",-2

146,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,It is only 91 grams and the one I used to have that was 95 grams was sooooo much better.,-2
147,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,If we filled the handle on that one it would play amazing.,-2
148,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,95 grams is a good weight for a blade.,-2

166,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too.,2
167,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks,1

169,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So if you like to win points of the serve you probably won't be that far back so I would go with tenergy 80 besides I don't like 64 as a backhand rubber anyway for me I would use it as a forehand rubber!,5

574,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,My impressions are (TG2 vs. H3) that TG2:,0
575,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-Has lower throw angle and thus smaller margin for error.,2
576,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-Has more Spin potential (especially at harder shots); H3 seems to be generally spinnier in low input shots.,2
577,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-Is a bit slower overall but has a higher ceiling for bottoming out this potentially can be faster/spinnier with the right stroke.,2
578,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,-has better feel for me; I can keep my pushes lower and place most shots with more accuracy as long as I’m taking care of the lower throw.,2

655,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,I hesitate between both,0
656,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,GoldArc should be somewhat spinnier but i like the Mantra M as a bh rubber better because it is not spin sensitive abd it is more bouncy.,1
657,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,I really fell every Ball on the racket crisp and controlling both active and passive shots with Manta M.,3

661,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Much more spin sensitive than Mantra M.,2

671,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,ESN rubbers have more factory tuning and perform significantly worse after 2-3 months.,5

691,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I personally use it as a fh rubber, paired wit a 2.2mm genesis 2 M in the backhand, which I particularly like.",0

940,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Yogi's point about durability is a good one too.,0
941,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),for me as a beginner the spin-sensivity is a big factor.,0
942,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),recieves are a big winning condition.,0
943,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),if i could have quite a similar rubber like Baracuda but with an improved chance of avoiding recieve errors then i would do the change.,0
944,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),i choosed the Barauda as my daily rubber because i can do lazy backspin into topspin attack as well as hard shots.,3
945,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),with H3 and other hard°rubbers i only could do hard shots.,3
946,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),thus this aspect is also important.,0
947,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),btw Andy: u choosed R47 as ur primary rubber.,0
948,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),may u give me a short comparison between it and g1/bara please.,0
949,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I have a Kid that plays with Baracuda, as he is a chopper, I chose that rubber for him, he can attack very agressively with more spin than the older better players that use M1, or even tenergy, the ball comes really heavy.",5
950,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),He can still chop with the FH and is a very difficult shot to top spin.,5
951,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I love that rubber, and with a little bit of booster, is the best.",4
952,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"stay with baracuda, it's great.",3
953,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),R47 is really different.,0
954,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"G1 and Baracuda are from a similar ESN release cycle, have a lot of similar properties.",1
955,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Rasanter is more recent - you get a matte topsheet, less catapult, more linearity (and for me, a better feeling of ""grab"" on the plastic ball, but not everyone agrees with that).",3
956,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Add to that a lower arc and it's a different proposition.,0
957,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It needs more effort to list backspin for sure.,2
958,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But I don't like the older ESN rubbers with the plastic ball - otherwise I'd probably be using G1 (in the absence of Adidas P7).,0
959,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"That said, I'm not the best person to ask about why I'm using my current setup.",0
960,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I change my rubber too often, so I'm not totally committed to anything you see in my signature.",0
961,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I'm looking very closely at a few new semi-tacky hybrid rubbers at the moment so it could all change in a flash.,0
962,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If you're prepared to use booster and don't mind the faff, this is a good shout too.",0
963,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Baracuda is cheap(ish) too!,3
964,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I have club members playing with years-old Baracuda.,3
965,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"They don't look fresh, somewhat stained, but still generate tons of spin, and are not crumbling away at the edges.",4
966,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Well, aside from the expected damage to rubber as well as blade after clipping the table.",0
967,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Indeed.,0
968,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Which is why I think it´s quite funny that over on German TT News some people now treat G1 as the answer to all questions and a serious alternative to tenergy.,0
969,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If that generation (or any ...) had been, the news would´ve spread earlier",0
970,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I think it is because some JNT members use it.,0
971,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Also, the new ball has made that generation more playable across the board even Hexer and Genius.",0
972,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),The Fastarc G-1 is an absolute oddity.,3
973,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It was released in July 2010, so over 2 years after Tenergy and close to 1 year after Baracuda/Hexer/Genius/X-plode.",0
974,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Unlike the others that started with a bang and then sank into oblivion, Fastarc G-1 has been in and out the top 10 of Table Tennis Kingdom sales ranking during the last years of 40mm, and only really became a best-seller well after the switch to the 40+(July, 2014).",0
975,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It's going strong in the ABS era(April, 2017) and has been at the top for the past 2 years except for 2 months, when Rozena temporarily dethroned it in Aug and Sep 2017.",0
976,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),May I throw in Vega Pro.,0
977,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I had both VP and Baracuda on same blade.,0
978,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Baracuda was miles ahead for me.,2
979,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Don't get the hype of it as a Tenergy clone.,0
980,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Vega pro is not comparable to baracuda but rather Acuda S2.,1
981,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I think Sigma 2 pro is closer to baracuda,1
982,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"In terms of sponge hardness, would the Rasanter R42 be closest to the Baracuda/G1?",0
983,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"As the name suggests, the R42 has a sponge hardness of 42° on the ESN-scale (I think they use Shore A), whereas the G-1 has a sponge hardness of 47.5°, so that's a rather significant difference.",-2
984,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),The R47 would be closer (if we're only talking about sponge hardness).,-2
985,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yes, absolutely.",-2
986,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),There will never be a good direct comparison between Baracuda and the Rasanter series - the whole rubber composition is just too different.,-2
987,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"The new Hexers might be a closer match, if you want something new.",-2
988,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If someone is used to using Tenergy 05, should they try the R47 out of the Rasanter series?",-2
989,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),How does the R47 and Tenergy 05 compare?,-2
990,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If you absolutely had to pick a Rasanter to replace T05, it would be R47 yes.",-2
991,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But they aren't that close.,-2
992,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"IMO R47 is more linear, easier to use, much better blocking and flat hitting, less sensitive to spin.",-2
993,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But it's also lower arc and you have to put your own muscle into the stroke to get good spin out.,-2
994,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It rewards committed strokes with good performance.,-2
995,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"T05 is generally more spinny across a whole range of gears but has all the usual T05 demands - spin sensitivity, catapult, price.",-2
996,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"R47 is the better rubber for my needs, but it's a personal decision rather than R47 being a T05 clone or something like that.",-2
997,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Fantastic thanks Andy I needed that sort of review/comparison.,-2

999,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Also how is it for close to the table attacking and serving?,-2
1000,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I presume it's quite good in the short game compared to Tenergy 05?,-2
1001,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),How would the R47 play on a Joo Se Hyuk blade would it suit?,-2
1002,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Lastly, what differences do I get from different sponge thicknesses with the R47?",-2
1003,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It's very likely ESN use Asker C, which has a spherical indenter.",-2
1004,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"DHS use Shore A, which has a truncated cone indenter.",-2
1005,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Because of that, simple translation and direct comparison between the 2 scales are prone to error and not recommended.",-2
1006,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Away from the table looping - it's OK.,-2
1007,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Spin is good but from distance you have to pay attention to the arc because it stays lower than some of its peers.,-2
1008,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Counterlooping - excellent.,-2
1009,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's very stable and forgiving of timing/power errors.,-2
1010,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Counter tends to stay low and nasty.,-2
1011,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Fishing - not really my bag, hard to comment.",-2
1012,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Close-in - it's solid.,-2
1013,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Great for flicks, close counters, basic drives.",-2
1014,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Because it's a bit inert compared to, say, MX-P, you have to muscle backspin openers a bit more than livelier rubbers.",-2
1015,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Serving is OK but I needed to make some adjustments to get good spin on short serves - needs care to avoid sending the serve into the middle zone.,-2
1016,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Much easier in the short game, blocking, than T05 for me.",-2
1017,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's easier and more predictable in general.,-2
1018,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"But if you're used to T05 and happy with the way it plays, you'd probably find R47 a bit dead and lifeless.",-2
1019,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's all a very personal experience.,-2
1020,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I haven't used a Joo so can't say for sure.,-2
1021,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),If you send me a PM I can send you a gently-used sheet of R47 in black ultramax to try out if you want.,-2
1022,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Might be a bit small for the Joo headsize though.,-2
1023,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Thickness - R47 has the new-ish thin topsheet/thicker sponge concept so plays a bit softer than you might expect with 47.5 hardness.,-2
1024,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I use Ultramax on the FH at the mo and it gives a little more catapult and more headroom when playing harder shots to get spin out of it.,-2
1025,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Thinner sponges (in general, IMO) tend to play a touch harder, less catapulty, more direct, and you sacrifice top-end spin for a little more straight-line speed.",-2
1026,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"So Max to support looping, thinner for driving/hitting I would say.",-2
1027,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),These things tend to be very personal impressions and YMMV.,-2
1028,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Best to try it out if you can.,-2
1029,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Only way to be sure!,-2
1030,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"You are correct, zeio.",-2
1031,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),ESN uses C; I mixed it up.,-2
1032,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),so guys i need to replace my rubber due to deterioration.,-2
1033,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),is it worth to try out the g1 as baracuda fan?,-2
1034,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"i am afraid that with harder sponge it will be much less comfort in doing all kind of shots well, esp opening up backspin.",-2
1035,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Andy, I don't suppose you still have the R47 do you?",-2
1036,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),PM me!,-2
1037,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Moving between rubber hardness levels is more difficult than moving between rubber brands/types.,-2
1038,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),It's a huge difference.,-2
1039,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But you won't know till you try.,-2
1040,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yes, it will be harder to perform shots you rely on, lifting backspin especially will be harder, but on the other hand, if you have the physical power for it, the harder rubbers will perform better and pressure opponents more with more speed and spin.",-2
1041,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"That said, just replacing rubbers isn't a magic spell, you won't get any of that extra speed and spin unless you're fit and have great technique.",-2
1042,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Without all that you'll just have a lot less speed and spin.,-2

1820,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,For BH rubber I would suggest DHS Skyline 3-60.,-2

1822,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,But well i would say H3 or H3Neo would be a better upgrade if you're used to H2,-2
1823,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"When compared H3 neo and H8, the H8 is slightly softer and has less tackiness so that's mean less spinny than H3 neo and also that means it gives you a bit more of control when playing even if you just start to use it",-2
1824,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,H3 neo would be close to H2 just that its a lot faster and low ball trajectory.,-2

1827,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Most people choose it because it is similar to T05 and is half the price of T05 with much more durability.,-2
1828,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Im currently using Omega V Pro and it is also similar to T05 in my point of view but it is slightly slower and less spinny but it has an incredible good control with high arc that helps to reduce errors or reduce hitting the ball into the net.,-2
1829,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Well it worth the try and im actually liking it.,-2

1839,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"So, for now, for your BH, if you want a really fast rubber with medium amount of spin go for Stiga rubbers",-2
1840,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Stiga rubbers are really fast but kinda lacks in control but you'll get use to it in a short amount of time,-2
1841,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"If you want a control with medium fast and medium spin, i would say try out Xiom Omega V Pro that im using",-2
1842,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,It would worth your try and check out TTD channel on YouTube and check out their rubber reviews videos,-2
1843,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,or search for reviews on specific rubbers in the equipment reviews i bet that will help you a lot,-2
1844,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Cheers!,-2

1846,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,IMO the difference between the two is the technique or approach.,-2
1847,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,If you like to loop the ball hard or spin the table that is H3 on the other hand H8 requires a more relaxed approach and really fine brushing if you loop the ball hard this is where I notice the slippage.,-2
1848,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,The H8's sponge is more active than the H3 so expect it to be bouncier and one thing I noticed is that the H8 is comparable to a H3 provincial especially the higher quality of topsheet and the active sponge.,-2
1849,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Lifting backspin is easy in H3 chinese style stroke and even easier in H8 if you can maximize the tacky topsheet and the active sponge.,-2
1850,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Next week I'm gonna go back to H3 because the H8's slippage on hard shots is really annoying.,-2

1855,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I did use tenergy 05 on my friend's bat for about 30 mins and tbh I found it really hard to control the trajectory of the ball due to it being very soft.,-2

1859,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I have been looking at chinese players equipment because I feel a closer resemblance to their playstyle and I have realised that all have chosen the H3 over the H8 (disregarding different edition like national).,-2

2132,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Baracuda is the most spinny rubber lve used.,1
2133,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,It is very easy to control during topspin to topspin rallies.,4
2134,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Very good for controlled looping and you can also hit the ball hard when needed.,4
2135,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,But the rubber is not that fast and is a little bit soft.,4
2136,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,I would recommend this rubber on the backhand.,4
2137,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,I never used any rubbers of the coppa series so I cant review them.,0
2138,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Rakza 7 has also good spin not as much as baracuda but I think it comes close to Tenergy 05.,1
2139,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,It has good touch in my opinion.,4
2140,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Some people say its too bouncy but they probably have a bad touch.,0
2141,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Its a very good rubber for flicking short balls.,4
2142,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,The only problem I found with this rubber is that when you try to hit the ball flatter and harder on the topspins you have less controll about where the ball goes.,5
2143,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,It work good on smashing high lobs but when they lob the ball lower you have to make a bit of a brushing action when smashing.,0
2144,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,so Ill rate the rubbers 1-10 on each point.,0

2321,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,The next highest quality rubbers are given to the Provincial teams and then the rest are sold commercially.,-2
2322,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Basically speaking all rubbers are made in facilities located in Germany, Japan, Korea or China.",-2
2323,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,It doesn't matter what brand it is they are usually made in one of these manufacturing facilities.,-2
2324,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"This means that the topsheets are typically comprised of the same rubbers, but the pips structures and sponges are made with different processes to provide the different feeling.",-2
2325,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,All rubber is created from a very large sheet.,-2
2326,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"I'm talking (and I don't know what the actual measurements are, but you will understand the concept from this example) about as large as a TT Table so let's say 9x5 feet.",-2
2327,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,The center of these rubbers have the highest quality control because they are the least likely to ripple or become different than the further out you go (Think pie crust when you roll it the center is always perfect but the further out you go it is usually worse) Each rubber is cut and then stamped with the different names and then tuned if necessary.,-2
2328,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"The different degrees of hardness I believe depend on the entire sheet's degree of hardness, but typically the center is always the hardest and the further out you go the less hard it is.",-2
2329,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,That is why commercial rubbers are always a little different from each other.,-2
2330,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,National versions are made to a player's specifications.,-2
2331,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Usually this means they are very hard and then the player will boost it to provide the proper softness feeling they prefer whether 42 degree like Wang Liqin and Ma Long or 40 degree like say Zhang Ji Ke or Xu Xin.,-2
2332,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Provincial players will usually ask for 38 degree or 39 degree which is why they are much more common.,-2
2333,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,This also means they will be boosting a bit less because it is already softer than the more CNT preferred 40 + degrees.,-2
2334,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,I think it is safe to say that Provincial players just don't hit as hard as the CNT players do which is why they are not in the CNT.,-2
2335,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,So to answer your questions I would have to say that blue sponge typically has more catapult than the orange sponge.,-2
2336,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,The Neo sponge is pretuned which makes it different than the Blue sponge but the topsheets are the same.,-2

2393,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,1)Dwell time (mostly related to spin but in soft rubbers it creates speed also),-2

2396,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Some physics to understand better,-2
2397,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,There are two forces on the ball a) the tangential one that creates spin b)and the lateral one that creates speed,-2
2398,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Notice that by the term speed we mean horizontal speed not vertical!,-2
2399,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,The actual result of these two forces is that the ball is travelling spinny and speedy creating an arc.,-2
2400,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Lets assume that a table tennis sponge is like a spring .,-2
2401,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Hard springs when compared to softer ones when fully compressed produce more force thus more acceleration (F= K X A , Newton's law) thus more speed, to the object that compresses them.",-2

2403,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Conclusion no1 : When the sponge is hard you need strong hitters to manage to compress the sponge at its full in order to take full advantage of its abilities !,-2
2404,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,To achieve that you need a hard hitter with perfect timing and angle of the racket.,-2

2406,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,That doesnt mean that if you are in good physical condition with fast footwork and good body & wrist rotation (but not a pro player) you cant play effectively with a chinese rubber,-2
2407,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,.,-2
2408,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Conclusion no2 : With softer sponges (the sponge has more ""porosity"") you need less power and have big margin for error in your angle of your strokes to achieve a desired arc (speed&spin).",-2

2410,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Conclusion no3 : Knowing the importance of timing, paddle angle and sponge hardness, underspins lifted with hard rubbers need perfect technique and timing compared to the soft ones.",-2
2411,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"A heavy underspin if lifted with a small error in technique using a soft rubber, maybe will not be lifted (or lifted with less pace & arc) with a hard rubber.",-2

2416,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Notice that conclusion1&2&3 are considering the exact same stroke with the exact same incoming ball to your paddle.,-2

2419,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I think this is the main problem.,-2
2420,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Read my previous post if you like  It is rather unlikely that the 729 FX produces more spin that the hurricane.,-2
2421,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Maybe you feel that way because it is softer thus giving you more feedback in your palm.,-2
2422,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Of course the fact that you have an OFF+ blade plays an important role in the dwell time of the blade...pre made paddles are very slow compared to custom ones.,-2
2423,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,So they have more dwell time=more spin,-2
