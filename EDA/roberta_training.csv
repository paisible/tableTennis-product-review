459,"The blue sponge sheets here cost $10 extra ($40 instead of $30) and I'll betcha it's a gimmick - since you ONLY find the blue sponge on National and Provincial sheets, it's GOT to be better, therefore people will pay more for it.",0

2061,Sent from my vivo X5Max using Tapatalk,0
3334,Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial.,0
827,Tibar K2 is very much like h3 boosted without needing any and xiom vega China and nitakku h3 turbo also,1

4163,"The bottom line is that M2 is the first "" T05 alternative"" I have tried that is acceptable, this after 4+ years with T05 and after spending way too much money on alternatives that I ripped off my blade in disgust, sometimes after just five minutes of play (see below).",0

663,After a couple months of playing the tackiness is still good (6/10).,3
1746,"Yours should be the B-type topsheet but the C-type, as it is used on the Light&Fast-version, may suit you as well.There's also a tensor-version and versions with japanese sponges but they may feel even softer than your 36-38° sponge.",0

646,I guess I'll have to work on improving my technique..The Mech-Tek in 1.7mm seems to be out of stock currently and the 2.1mm may be more difficult to control on my backhand so I guess I'll have to wait.,0

1805,"Wonder why I didn't tried it earlier.Good control, heavy spin, quick enough if you want.Hope this positive first impression lasts longer.",0
755,It comes in different sponge hardness...,0
347,Fxp is more of a direct sponge compression type of contact.,0
794,And Palio - the new AK47s seem OK quality wise but their older sheets were really hit and miss.,3

760,Yasaka Shining Dragon is a mid-hard rubber but much lighter than Chinese stuff.,3

2039,That is what i think.,0
329,I use the VKM blade as well and have used Xiom Vega Japan for about 5-6 years now.,0
933,is it easier with the fastarc due to the amount of spin which is to override,0
1781,fast or normal speed?,0

4646,"Especially on the serves.Has to do with how soft the rubber is, hasn't it?Does anybody know how the other rubbers compare with roxon in those respects?Nille",0
228,"Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer.",0
1800,Topsheet will wear out after about 3 - 4 months though it will stay tacky throughout the life of the rubber.,0
2218,"When playing the T64 it need a high load to ""activate"" the rubbers potential which make the rubber great when push blocking.",0
905,equally well (or equally poorly) with both.,0
3318,For someone who has had little or no coaching you seem to be putting the effort into looking at how to improve.If you're dissatisfied with your FH rubber (I've no experience of jpen) you could consider sticking with the same rubber in a not so soft version - the Vega Europe.The Baracuda I wouldn't recommend - it's essentially an old rubber but for the Spin & Speed it gives it's not great on control.Genius Sound I know nothing about but it's rated at 37.5 degree compared to the 42.5 degree of the Baracuda.,3
1393,Also you couldgo for fx-s instead of el-s for more control and less power.,1
343,Ordered the Xiom omega VII pro.Let's c if its plays well.Thank all for the help.Greetings,0
4382,The sponge of pro is definitely not harder than the asia( check the hardness ratings).,0
565,It starts off with high throw but will gradually lower to medium-low.,4

408,In reality its would much easier to start comparing rubbers and blades: Robots playing with Robots in an isolated environment.,0
1899,fast rubbers like t-05 and mxp kinda hinders progression of individual technique and too reliant on the rubbers itself providing you energy vs you swinging properly to make a good play.,3

348,Elp would be better if you brush,2
2943,Slightly heavy (as with all evolution rubbers) in max at around 44 grams cut but you could opt for a slightly thinner version.,4
694,"To be honest, Mantra H's speed is more on the Bryce Speed range so it is not surprising that people find it too fast.",1

879,3) T88 New Taiji uses the same topsheet (or came out of the same mold) as the Old Taiji.,0
3335,Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge.,0
4012,Maybe it is just because it is much spinny than it looks rather than being more spinny in absolute terms.,4

828,and yeah the normal battle 2 with orange sponge is over rated have to agree on that,0
538,I think this is the matrix TheKLeifheit13 was referring to.http://gamblertt.com/images/rubberselectorchart2018.jpgI contacted Zeropong and they were kind enough to share this although I do not see quite a few rubber/sponge combinations in their catalog.,0
4094,I'm not sure about Bluefire but I'm sure it is compared to death with T05 at one of the TT blogging sites.I think a lot comes down to what standard you are.,0
388,They both complained that after 2 months it is reasonable to replace H8.I cannot give you a hint which exact rubber to use as a replacement.,0
704,I liked the Burst GearZ but felt like I wanted something a bit harder (for me).,3
496,I did not like either for my general FH...,0
1102,Slower really means more linear with less catapult.,0
3344,From my experience with an EL-P I would have thought that a MX-P would be very durable.,3
4126,"Ok I just sold my unused but new GFX card and have some cash to spend, I think that I'm going to check out the Rasant and Bluefire in 2.1 and 2.0mm respectively.",0
1128,My club mate who did said he preferred G1 and thought it was an improved Razka 7 when he tested it ( and this was without my asking for that comparison).,1
1312,i'm afraid Vega Pro and H3 Neo boosted are totally different rubbers,0
161,"However, in all ""sub-optimal strokes"" some rubbers can generate more speed/spin.",0
906,"Taiji DID feel a slight amount softer, but I really had to stop and think about it.",3
655,I hesitate between both,0
944,i choosed the Barauda as my daily rubber because i can do lazy backspin into topspin attack as well as hard shots.,3
1747,Found the CJ8000 Speed with 43 deg sponge.,0
689,"Without having as much xp as you folks, I would say short game is where I find the mantra (M in my case) a bit lacking.",3
421,"Our playing style then different - full body rotation, power from your hips and etc (ask boxer does he hit using hand power or hips and torso power?",0
1471,That 3 rubbers Which one is balance between spin and speed ?,0

4110,Thanks Baal for clarifying.,0
934,"Didn't they recently repackage Hadou, like they did with AK47?Iskandar",0
1190,"You get decent speed without putting in the effort, so that at first glance you can get away with mistiming or approximate technique.",0
4351,I think a lot has to do with the distributors in the respective states foam.,0
4336,"The Hexer HD topsheet feels hard but thin, and it feels like you can't really get the spin until you stretch that topsheet.",3
1737,"CJ8000 isn't particularly slow, either.Iskandar",3
318,Dammit Butterfly.,0
3330,What turned me off to it is the relatively low throw angle rating.,0
2118,I would probably go for the Sriver though.,0
1936,Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,0
2607,what are differences?,0
1401,Had a practise session today and I analysed my game.,0
62,But they are all really great rubbers.,0

2183,Hello butt stallion I havent played with T64 much but I think T05FX is one of the most allround rubbers out there.,1
652,For my style of playing its the BEST fh rubber ever.,4
2594,Omega asia claims to be plastic ball ready.,0
758,Just be mindful that a light rubber will not play the same as a heavy one.,0
1913,"I don't think the throw angles are very different, but mx-p might be slightly higher.",2
2050,"Tenergy 05 is more or less the most used rubber, therefore very few would recommend you to change if you have the money for it.",3
1367,How far from the table do you play?,0
3664,I currently use barracuda 1.8 black on backhand.,0
859,"Now, after playing more, I realize my fears were unfounded.",0
479,"Water and hand also works, but i am allergic to probably latex in the rubber, and rubbing my palm across the rubber irritates my hand badly.PS.",0
4076,As well I get plent speed and spin to be honest each week it actualy playing with it is much better.,0
1142,Genius is an absolutely excellent rubber.,3
438,"However, O7P is awesome if you want a rubber not too sensitive to incoming spin.",3
752,So what is the reason that keeps you from using it instead of H3?,0
4055,"There is 1Q HD , tibhar says that sponge is harder a bit on HD.I somehow Was leaning twards 1Q but didn't play with any of two rubbers.",1
2224,I use blue fire jp 03 on my backhand it is incredible!,3
658,The rubber doesnt surprice you wtih catapult effect.,4
2933,Grippy rubber.,4
1077,The rubber shrank on the blade.,0
3573,"Please help, Thank you!",0
282,"That would save you a lot of trouble right away, but we are curious cats.Unless you have a fast bat and the stroke to get the ball into the rubber and sponge, you will not get everything you could get out of MX-S.",0
212,"But take note, the choice of blade is crucial.",0
1391,"As time goes by when the rubber is worn and time to get a new one, you can get the 05.The article you mentioned already gives you a lot of description and also example of users.",0
4073,"If this Tibhar stuff is better still, then it must be awesome rubber!",0
2056,Anything you're having a hard time doing with Tenergy 05?,0
245,Ten has higher throw angle,2
930,It easily chips at the side of the topsheet.,4
358,So it depends on how flexible your blade is.,0
2930,Quite light.,4
2186,A good choice would also be donic acuda or yasaka rakza 7 soft if you dont like T05FX,0
2206,Everyone is different.,0
3581,"Why don't you try the Galaxy 896 with the TG3 on the forehand and the H3N on the backhand, this would be a could set up if you want to loop better.",0
1122,I know a guy who couldn't use anything but Tenergy until he used G1.,0
484,"I do have to say that the Thor's sponge has a lot of power available, though.",0
681,But I feel that the Mech-Tek would have been better for me from a mid-court perspective.I'm still developing a more consistent BH but do not want to EJ since I feel that will impact my learning curve.,3
618,"Also, I have been looking for reviews of the Zero with Blue Diamond sponge but have been unable to find them.",0
47,"Lifehack: buy T05 first, then once it wears out, buy T80, or vice versa.",0
421,Both top sheet and sponge deteriorates over time.,0
358,I don't remember why the heavier sponge was worse in this case.. probably control issues.,0
1371,"EL-S requires a decent impact to get any spin out of it, so it probably will not be that different from Mantra M. At the same time, 45 degrees is not too hard for BH, so probably the best thing is to review your BH technique.",0
4019,IMO these rubbers beats Tenergy on push and serve mainly due to its vicious spin.I found Magna TX II a lot spinnier than any of the Calibras on push and serves.,0
4103,I am hoping someone who really likes T05 and is a current T05 or T64 user will review Bluefire.,0
3324,Thanks!,0

621,"(maybe with a bit softer rubber, I could return better)",0
1516,(Does anybody use bryce for their forehand?,0
293,"However, Baracuda still has a medium-high throw so they're both perfectly fine for looping.",2
1736,I'd think pretty much any Chinese rubber would work and not be too fast.,0
2172,"As your backhand movement should be more compact than your forehand stroke, a tensor Euro can help you to compensate it.",0
1293,EL-S is mu choice since the el-p easily loses its bounciness and the el-s is spinnier with a lil bit more bounce.,1
2623,A thread is useless.,0
255,"Yes, it is a little bit shocking since you would expect to get an extremely overpowered rubber for ~$80 a sheet but actually, Baracuda surpasses Tenergy in spin.",1
289,"Yes, it is a little bit shocking since you would expect to get an extremely overpowered rubber for ~$80 a sheet but actually, Baracuda surpasses Tenergy in spin.",1

2928,Powersponge.,0
1192,"Basically with H3N and similar rubber, what you get is what you put in (I'm talking in terms of stroke quality rather than physicality).",0
643,"Both are modern tensor-type rubbers, of course, but both are not extremely bouncy.",2
698,"I've been using Burst Thor's on my FH and Mech-Tek on my BH (penhold) for a while and really like both.I recently saw that Gambler now has Burst with the Gearz sponge, and also X3 Diamond with Gearz (a mechanical grippy rubber).How does Burst Gearz compare to Burst Thor's?How does X3 Diamond Gearz compare to Mech-Tek?Any thoughts would be appreciated.",0
1445,"Just to make one thing clear, although the Quantums were released after the first Evolution rubbers they are by no means an update.",0
1370,Do you brush the ball on backhand or hit through the sponge to create spin?,0
2069,"In the rapidity aspect, both are more or less equal.",2
444,Please explain,0
319,I think a relatively harder faster rubber will compensate for the slower blade.,0
1469,Maybe something like Hurricane 3-50 or Hurricane 8 might do the job.,0
381,I suspect that the Bloom series are similar.,3
202,Sounds to me you are looking at a way overkill equipment.,0
48,This way you will learn by yourself how these rubbers play for you.,0
1453,"The stiff topsheet of EL-P makes it ideal for direct play, EL-S is the rubber for a pretty easy first ball on underspin and everything that follows topspin-wise.",3
914,"I mainly boost to revive ""dead"" rubbers (Tensors), and rarely boost Chinese rubbers.",0
395,The blue sponge version is much more expensive.My usual cleaning routine is to wipe off the rubber with a wet sponge and put a non-sticky plastic sheet on it.,0
830,Do they also tend to absorb oil better than the Neo version?,0
645,My primary problem was on the BH and I thought this may be due to the lack of power on the BH vs FH and getting a rubber with higher throw would help.,0
813,If you find FXS a bit soft you could try one of the harder Tibhar rubbers in the same series such as MXP or MXS or perhaps Aurus Prime,0
600,DHs H3 Neo is my prefered rubber with H2 Neo being second.,1
1182,"Also, both H3 Neo and G1 are relatively slower than MX-P and/or GA8 so you may simply be landing more balls on the table.",1
349,"But, counter looping against high level loops with thinner sponge, I can't say I know anyone that does that.",0
287,"Thanx, I'm a loop oriented player on both wings.",0
6,I bought recently the complete Garaydia family to see if from the blade I had a possibility to improve my skills and I would say no.,0
1880,You could try Xiom Vega Elite.,0
315,"Ten is more sensitive to incoming topspin, though can be adjusted with blade or sponge layer",2
592,"If you're still gearing in the strokes, still learning, then Zero would be a safe selection.",3
1322,You should get both and decide with which one you feel better.,0
862,"At my current level of play, I don't think I will have any issues but couldn't decide and was hoping someone had some experience with those rubbers to guide me.",0
1386,"So, caveat emptor.",0
776,6 layers is nonsense.,0
2190,The next time I change rubbers I will have 64 on my backhand because that is what I have lined up.,0
1461,I have used rakza x in the past and realised that after two months the rubber lost its punch.,3
434,I agree with above.,0
55,T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer.,2
768,"Also 868 is a little lighter than normal (but it's got 2.0mm sponge rather than 2.2, despite what it says on the package).",3
1396,"i say the speed is almost the same but with a higher arc on the mx-s. overall, i like the mxs better because it is a well balanced rubber in terms of control and speed and it has this vicious spin potential that is greater than the genesis m. also, it is not as sensitive to incoming spin.",1
295,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it.",3
956,"Just get one, if it peels, it peels, you don't really need to worry about that for six months at least...",0
320,I'am used to the DHS Long 5.,0
2579,it's still approvedhttp://www.ittf.com/ittf_equipment/Rack ... &textile=&i read on many reviews Omega has less spin than Sigma and i prefer rubbers similar to T05,0
4058,I must be playing to long With Hexer HD,0
4167,"It is an excellent feel, though.",4
283,I also personally think that Baracuda is a much better rubber in terms of worth for money.,2
1377,"I can't tell what level I am because there is no TT Rank in my country but I'm developing all the time because I'm just 22yo, lost my weight, I'm getting faster and faster with my legs.",0
274,"Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny.",1
4404,2.0mm.,0
349,Thanks!,0
298,It sounds a little like Tibhar Hybrid K1.,2
1401,Im pretty sure that MX-S on average is heavier.,2
2961,"Or can you recommend a rubber which is similar to roxon 450, but spinnier and grippier ?",0
2628,i think i will choose Omega IV Pro cause most ppl are using this Omega version,0
2170,"For these, I'll break into two: Euro and Japanese (they act differently though)",0
1903,I use a Tibhar defense plus.I like the control and the fact that its not too fast and not too heavy.I simply find the trajectory on my backhand rather flat and direct which results in only just clipping the net yet I have never had this issue with any of the previous rubbers.Thought maybe this would be to do with the throw angle being lower than the other rubbers.,3
75,I go with slower and more spin every time.,0
3327,I had that on my radar as well!,0
1780,"If you want recommendation for BH rubbers, please provide more info on what type do you want?",0
1333,In that case I don't think the Tenergy is the right rubber since it is springy and high throw.,0
250,Dammit Butterfly.,0
4011,"As an asise, I note that I can get a more effective spin pushing on my backhand with a SP (Raystorm) than I can with any inverted.",0
878,"It uses the ""62-008"" topsheet (in the LARC simply as ""T88"").",0
796,Which is why Apple makes its I-Phones in China.,0
49,And the difference between them is not that big so you can go from one to another with a minimal adjustment.,0
363,I play on 5ply all wood blade (dhs pg3).,0
605,"I also have a good flick that, more often than not, lands on the table and is hard to return.",0
2632,"Very low arc.On the backhand I use Omega IV Europe----- quite a high throw,completely different rubber from the above.I have tried Sigma Pro---- it grips the ball very well with a lower throw than Omega.Sigma 2----- I believe from having a quick hit with it,is the opposite to Sigma 1 in that it has a high throw with excellent dwell time but slightly slower.I get very confused with the rubbers coming out with the similar name and play differently.",4
3646,It's speed makes it better mostly for close to the table play.,0
82,"With the term best, I mean actually the best experience with these rubbers.",0
772,"Sounds like the old AK47, actually.Blue is lighter?",4
321,@Iskandar; I refuse to buy the overpriced butterfly rubbers........  Greetings!,0
975,"It's going strong in the ABS era(April, 2017) and has been at the top for the past 2 years except for 2 months, when Rozena temporarily dethroned it in Aug and Sep 2017.",0
1892,this is a costly test assuming the rubber prices hahaha,0
922,"As far as I can tell (the thickness, ply thicknesses, and playing characteristics) the blade is exactly the same as my M8s.",0
4371,I agree that Xiom Omega IV Asia is a very good rubber but if it's certainly better than the Omega IV Pro?,3
1420,Warm up drives: A little slower than MX-P and a little lower arc.,2
939,"Quite similar overall, both good rubbers.",2
8,I'm truly amazed about the huge difference between those 3 blades.,0
209,I want to upgrade my set-up.,0
843,Really????,0
2213,I have played with T64 on my BH for almost 3 season now and have tried many other rubbers incl.,0
417,"Jap style rubbers, for example Palio AK47 red or blue, would spin your ball not less than tacky STN, but these are just ""grippy"" top sheets and not sticky at all.Sure you know it better than me that tackiness in Chinese classic rubbers is to compensate for the otherwise short dwell time because of hard sponge.",0
1792,"Also the ""factory-tuning"" doesn't really do anything spectacular either.",0
4648,Roxon is a good rubber and you appear to be very happy with it - why change?,0
682,"The best part (to me) is not the availability of the high gears, but the lack of bounciness in the lower gears.",4
566,"Initially out of the packet, it is very tacky but after my first time cleaning it, it lost most of the tack.",4
1176,"For me, trying Tenergy is just out of pure curiosity, since there's absolutely nothing wrong with Rhyzers I have.",0
797,"I am currently using B2P right now, the other thing that I like from B2P is the strong glue between topsheet and sponge.",3
1314,"If you have never used a chinese topsheet rubber before, go Vega Pro",0
431,The blue sponge has magical properties.,0
648,I guess I'll have to play with it to find out how much of an adjustment is required.,0
1787,"Neo works good on flexible blades, also this rubber maintain much longer tackiness than hurricane 8.",1
1045,Both where tested on an innerforce alc blade for one session of 2 hours each.,0
316,Bara is much more durable (according to reviewers),2
748,I dumped my Battle 2 after two sessions.,0
4271,The rubber did everything Aurus does with more feel and speed/spin.,0
3559,I'm currently using TG2N and H3N on Xiom Offensive S and I really like it.,0
676,Staticshock10 - thank you for your input.,0
2201,Yep.,0
3663,"S2 was flatter, still they are very similar rubbers.",2
642,"As far as linearity goes, I couldn't really say.",0
1734,On the other hand there are many other sheets that would work just as well and cost less.,0
298,"Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine.",3
4363,"but, you know,the ej bug...",0
4142,"it would be much appreciated if anyone with experience with these two rubbers would share his views with us,thank you!",0
1047,"Rakza was fast too, but not so fast, it was quite spinny too, maybe a little less than mxs but can't be sure about that, and I could control it quite easily.",1
3554,I suggest Avalox P500.,0
1191,"Non-boosted Chinese tacky rubber is almost as fast once you're aiming for power, and in my experience the shots are often perceived as spinnier and equally powerful.",0
491,"As an aside, I took a look at the Burst rubber on my backup paddle and it is definitely more tacky than the newer STN on my primary paddle.",1
353,hard Chinese vs. soft Tensor).,0
3331,It's not much different than the Vega Pro Elite that I have now.,2
179,"Other than that, it is really little difference for any player that is not ranked in the top level (in the top level, a 1% difference is a matter about winning and loosing)",0
820,What kinda movie are you filming?,0
292,"Tenergy has a slightly higher throw angle than Baracuda, so looping heavy chops may be a little bit easier, with a greater arc on the ball.",1
4275,"Noce looking rubber and HARD sponge, which I really like on FH wing.",0
61,There are people whose game and style of play may work with one of them slightly better than the others.,0
259,Really?,0
1922,"I haven't had chance to try it out yet but the sponge looks really similar, while the topsheet feels similarly tacky but is a fair bit softer.",2
2229,T05fx of course,0
816,"Typically, hard rubbers are not recommended to be paired with the Blue Devil.",0
397,"So, the question is not which one will give you more spin but which kind of rubber do you prefer?",0
4344,I need more informatiom about this rubber.,0
2028,I think i've found one that fits.,0
1290,I agree here.,0
4184,"I dont like Ten05 fx, too soft, too slow.Just take a hard, max Ten05, or Raza or HexerHD are also good",0
1164,This is very difficult to say.,0
980,Vega pro is not comparable to baracuda but rather Acuda S2.,1
2592,I guess it wasn't very popular.,0
728,"Not sure, but I think Asia is with a tensor sponge and not tacky topsheet.",3
4132,"Haha yeah, Something like that.",0
1466,"Five months is good, if you play on a regular basis.",0
1368,Can you read your opponents spin well?,0
4268,I played some matches with the club locals and a short summary would be that Evolution MP-X plays like a tenergized version of Aurus.,0
419,"And opposite, if there is hard sponge then topsheet is made tacky to win back some dwell time.",0
735,So I thought the high end Omega VII might offer a better sponge.,2
395,"Mantra is a Japanese rubber to rival tenergy and might just go out of production over time, supply is low in Europe, don´t know whether Stiga will continue to distribute it elsewhere.",0
1301,It is also a little bit heavier (but still in the light rubbers category so not too much of a concern).,2
401,I have it on Thor's Hammer on 2 blades.,0
435,After playing O7P for a few weeks I was quite disappointed for its low spin.,3
284,Dammit Butterfly.,0
436,"Control, feel and speed are all fine.",4
821,"For away from the table, I much preferred faster, lower arched tensors.Nevertheless, for nostalgia sake, I'm picking up a 999 sheet for fun",0

1770,Iskandar,0
1467,"It will be difficult to find a rubber that lasts longer, if you want the same power.",0
3661,It was a bit fast for me but I could off and on hit some amazing shots with it.,3
164,"Again, that being said, rubber manufacturing is not very precise (tenergy included), so one sheets might feel different than another of the same model...Take what you need to help you move on.",0
1137,I’ve been praising R7 for the BH since I’ve started to use it but I found a great deal on G1 that I couldn’t pass up to try it.,0
1101,I agree.,0
85,Tabletennis is not only about spinny topspin.,0
4025,I dont get to play against them very often so I don't dual get to see it from the other guys perspective.,0
4101,Thanks foam.,0
3566,But I recommend ALL blades for better feel.,0
501,"I remember one tip - if it actually says ""National Version"" (in Chinese) on the back then it's fake.",0
172,Too fast for me for BH especially with OFF blade.,0
1108,But I wanted something that suited my current game after taking a 9 month hiatus.,0
1369,What throw do you prefer on backhand?,0
907,"If there was a difference, it was pretty subtle - or it might've just as easily been in my head.",0
480,Next.,0
493,The rubber or Igor?,0
1441,"that is quite different opinion of what tibhar says: 45 degrees is quite hard, it shoult be harder then EL-P. On polish website I have found that quantum is very spinny, while you say it is more fast the spinny.",2
688,I personally think that Mech-Tek is better on the FH than on BH.,0
657,I really fell every Ball on the racket crisp and controlling both active and passive shots with Manta M.,3
1348,But I don't think it was intended for that...,0

4171,"I have not found that to be the case with any of the ""alternatives"" that have been touted over the last several years.",0
967,They do not have to be the exact same ones.,0
3319,Genius Sound is supposedly a very good rubber but a more up to date version of it would the 5Q sound at the same 37.5 degree.Haven't tried the 5Q sound but the 5Q is a super rubber but imagine it would be too advanced for you at this stage but it can work well for Shakehanders on both sides depending on the blade.There's also the Joola Maxxx 400 which I haven't tried.Safe option.,3
861,My question was related to whether I should go for the Taiji (36 degree sponge which is a bit on the soft side) or one of the tensors that I specified.,0
1918,"It's probably classed as a hybrid because it's semi-tacky (topsheet looks very much like yinhe big dipper) rather than full-on tacky like a classic H3, and its sponge is modern and porous (I could believe it if someone said it was a japanese sponge - it's really nice) rather than rock-hard and solid.",0
4131,Finally a complete review,0
549,Thanks for the link to the chart.,0
4330,Asia seems to have a noticeably softer sponge than Pro despite the claims to the contrary.,1
931,NO ONE NOTICED THIS FOR THE ENTIRE EVENING...,0
1347,I always preferred 64 over 05 for short action/close to the table counterlooping.,1
656,I've played with Sevens and Mech-Tek 2.1mm.,0
4169,"The thing is, if you are used to T05, you can play exactly the same way, and play just as well without having to make many adjustments at all.",0
873,"(But it does have ""Supple Sponge"", ""Tense"" and ""Tenacious Violence"".",0
889,Iskandar Those are some very interesting observations about the Sanwei rubbers.,0
10,after a training I'll see if it fits for me or if I have to test it with the garaydia T5000 or Garaydia ZLC as I'm seeking more spin...,0
278,"In conclusion,",0
698,Forgot the new company name.,0
613,"Although I really liked some Chinese rubbers, I find it to give me too much work to keep it clean/dry during training.",0
279,MX-S is a fast offensive rubber.,3
487,"I know my kind of impact (how I strike the ball) and I am not great with a firm sponged dynamic rubber in most shot situations, except for couterlooping medium to fast loops... then I am boss... but have significantly harder time doing the other tasks I do more frequently.",0
4031,+1,0
198,"I like that T05 pushes over the table are flat and spinny and gives you a decent serve return that sometimes causes opponent to net if you push fast enough,bear in mind this is one of the highest/arcing throw rubbers so the best of both worlds,even on my thin flex def blade,+longer lasting than most factory boosted rubbers so the extra cost evens out somewhat in the long runI also tried Dignics 05 and for me was inferior to T05 on all shots,serve return in particular where the ball was way too high and I couldn't find a way with it,maybe I'm too used to the t05 where everything seems to work on autopilot for me.",1
799,"I have one (Black 39°-41°), and there's nothing wrong with it, and it plays amazing.",0
391,Nice rubber.,0
2646,"The 868 comes in a variety of actualy hardness, so we'd have to know what the particualr hardness was as well.",0
1422,FH Loops: Low arc from any distance.,4
697,DAIKI Japan.,0
590,"Teaches me to be aggressive, but I need to find that balance of controlled power.",0
699,I haven't been able to find any good information about these rubbers despite intensive googling.,0
2136,I would recommend this rubber on the backhand.,4
4061,"Thank you , you may be right,5Q probably would be good choice,thanks",0
1287,"A bit off the topic, but I also tried EL-P on my previous TB ALC.",0
1768,I've got a Tupperware full of half-used rubber to show for it.,0
447,Who knows what that stuff really is and who among the pros actually uses it.,0
324,"However, Tenergy has a better control, and has significantly more power.",2
2012,The 999 series of rubbers are excellent and used to be far more popular than Hurricane.,1
2207,"For me, I can get the ball to sink into the topsheet and sponge and really spin the ball well with my backhand when I am using 05FX.",0
612,"Depending on where you live in Brazil, I find that the high humidity can really mess with Chinese rubbers tackiness.",0
4278,"The result is more dwell and feel, plus that awesome sponge transmits the power and spin.I made a vid goofing of in a casual doubles match over there at Ace club in Bucheon.",0
455,You can buy brick 999 globe and like more than tenergy 05,0
1364,And here is next question- is it worth to pay 20$ more for Tenergy if you can get almost the same cheaper,0
2657,"I just glued up a bat with the 868 Tokyo with 30-35 Japan sponge, and this stuff is light too!",3
1764,"And I went with the softest ZAP (what was it, 32 degrees?).",0
592,The feeling and almost “specialty” characteristics of it... just kind of cool for me.,0
1064,But MX-S is less durable than rakza7 also.,1
779,.,0
743,Alot more gears and more spin than H3.,2
839,"I've pretty much decided, with Chinese rubber, if half a dozen of one and six of another - the $5 sheets work about as well as the $10-15 sheets, the $20 sheets are probably slightly faster, H3 is dead slow unless you have Ma Long's muscles (or boost it).",0
307,I've used both T05 and Fastarc G-1 with great success on the VKM.,1
1100,Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,0
1306,"I am unable to compare ""throw"" for either as I tried these rubbers on different blades and felt it was close enough to feel the same.",2
808,"Mind you, they are a little slower than a lot of other Chinese rubbers (even the Green Dragon).",4
3562,Then it is probably going to be a Xiom Offensive S H3N for forehand and TG2N for backhand.,0
2204,To me it felt great.,0
867,"I didn't notice the part about ""soft Japanese sponge"" on the blurb:I took out my ""M8"" premade and did the finger test to see if it felt softer than T88-I, kinda hard to tell.",0
550,I just switched from Burst Thor's Hammer to Zero Blue Diamond because I didn't realize the regular Burst had Blue Diamond Sponge  I wish the Zeropong website said that.,0
1170,"I love the way t05 feels, but it costs 60 Euro (no discount).",3
422,You might be very surprised ...) Similar mechanics here.,0
278,?,0
591,"If comfortable with the first, the Burst would be the indicated choice and believe Tom at Zeropong would confirm this.",0
3317,I had a little look through your posts and was quite impressed with your jpen blog.,0
868,I'll try playing again with the racket tomorrow and see if I can tell the difference.,0
4381, Well I'm a flat hitter aswell and I really can't feel much difference between the two rubbers.,0
1146,I've always used Tenergies and every time I try to switch to a tensor I don't have a good experience.,0
796,"However when boosted/speed glued properly, B2 Provincial is still playable and is a cheaper alternative than H3P.",1
825,The Globe stuff and the 999 Corporation stuff is pretty similar.,1
433,that lack of grip is good for not sensitive to spin so u can counter easier dna idk at all,0
159,"So if that takes your mind off the idea of ""if there are better stuff out there"", it will let you perform your best.But, at the end of the day, ALL rubbers are energy dissipating material.",0
427,Thank you for the tip about using a drop of soap with the water once a week.,0
2120,"You might actually be better off taking those rubbers and putting them on a slower, all wood blade for a few weeks or months before going back up to your old setup.",0
1474,Rakza 7 for me is the rubber that gives the feeling it will last longer than MX-P.,1
2194,@upsidedowncarl:,0
2077,I recommend them without any doubt.,0
1,Usually I have a Primorac Carbon and I'm offensive player with agressive top spin.,0
573,"It should be ""more spin""I will check out Mantra H, thanksdo you have any suggestions for Chinese rubbers?",3
390,"On 729 scale H47 will feel harder than STN, so H45 is probably closer.",1
1429,Better on BH than MX-P.,2
842,tibar k2,0
4077,I don't now about 1Q XD thats why was hoping that someone had played with and share some info about it.,0
500,I see and feel what they did.,0
1332,"I am just assuming a lot of things about your game here.If you plan to play a close-to-the-table kind of game, are you saying you want to play a more push block sort of game?",0
777,given how inconsistent some these Chinese products are) ...,0
1404,"Apart from that, at my level I can cover abot 3/4 or even 4/5 of the table with my FH.",0
4191,"He played it on BH mostly, but in general he alternated between BH and FH in training.",0
1085,These two rubbers don't work well on the new ABS ball.,4
639,"Producing spin, for me, felt a bit easier with GA8 than with Mantra M in serving and in pushes.",1
4645,Is rasant/ calubra a lot faster than roxon 450?Also i'm quite pleased with the amount of spin I can create with roxon?,1
1771,Yesterday my Neo Skyline 2 arrived.,0
417,"I prefer GA8/50 to T05, but still give T05 a distinct edge in spin creation.",1
474,"So, save the money.",0
1475,The topsheet on the rubber feels and smell more natural at least to the crazy boosted MX-P,1
1430,Reviewer recommend this to aggressive attack players who likes to hit the ball hard.,0
1173,But I have friends from third league and beyond who get to try every new Tensor generation and don´t ever think about switching.,0
389,"I've used Mantra S on the BH, I prefer softer on the BH.",0
1116,Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,0
603,"First of all, do you know you tried real Hurricane 3 National?",0
388,Genesis is probably spinner but that may affect the control.,2
2052,"Therefore, Do you want more speed?",0
182,"Put the Tenergy on, say, a T11+ or a Sardius and I'd probably not be able to use it all that well.",0
53,The difference is not the sponge.,0
323,"Yes, it is a little bit shocking since you would expect to get an extremely overpowered rubber for ~$80 a sheet but actually, Baracuda surpasses Tenergy in spin.",1
951,"Personally, I don't find having two matched rackets all that important - first of all, I'm not making a living through table tennis, nor are any tournament results or even league matches on the line, but also, to be honest, I can't really tell the difference between the three or four M8s I have with different rubbers I carry around in my bag.",0
691,Really gives you the confidence!,0
4024,"I've only got the 1.8mm sponge rather than max, not sure if that has a difference.On a quicker blade with max sponge I reckon the Omega IV Elite would give most top-end rubbers a run for their money in terms of spin.",0
4178,(Back in the day I used Bryce very heavily speed glued).,0
4152,"Over all I found the Rasant a little less forgiving on stroke play, but I think with more time to adjust and get used to the rubber it would be a fine rubber in its own right.",0
273,For someone who always played Europeans style rubbers MX-S may be challenging.,3
4179,"Among the non-tensors, Calibra LT was not a terrible rubber, but too fast for my liking.",0
1464,You can also give Xiom omega Iv pro a try.,0
1379,however el-s is a matter of taste.,0
832,"It does claim to be a ""backhand rubber"".",0
4662,From memory Roxon is somewhere in between Mark V and Rasant/T05.,0
403,Both will hold a ball for at least 6 seconds upside down.,0
1495,Although I think I would really want a tensor rubber on my backhand for the sudden speed and ease of use.,3
4070,"Personally, I thought there was a fairly big difference between Rasant and HD.",0
472,"It isn't so cut and dried as asking if this rubber is ""better"" for FH or BH.",0
2035,And it does lasts a lot.,0
219,"For instance blade Primorac JP OFF-, very good blade or Tibhar Stratus Powerwood.",0
2554,Players who want a livelier more European rubber like Sigma or the new Vega Japan.,3
564,"It produces huge spin, but speed-wise you must have excellent forearm acceleration on your loops to get the best out of it.",3
1375,I wouldn't risk experimenting with a new rubber.,0
4023,"It also gets plenty of topspin on loops and twiddled backhand strokes, though possibly not as much as the Tenergy 05FX I've played with briefly.",2
962,That is why I was looking at different rubbers than the ones I currently have.,0
880,Same headstamp in any case.,0
1793,The P.O.,0
2203,I have a friend who has a Rosewood XO with 05FX on both sides.,0
604,There are a lot of fakes our there and you can check with the serial code on the bacl,0
350,Anyone know anyone who is using thin sponge to counter loop at a high level?,0
1785,Iskandar,0
3547,You can try these after liking commercial ones !What is more just forget about bosting : ) Get used to untuned rubbers.,0
902,"And it might not be a problem with every sheet, either.",0
227,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it.",3
2629,You might want to read a May 17 timeline post of USA Hobby Table Tennis Coalition on their FaceBook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/USA-Hobb ... 7322692911,0
626,I’m posting this reply here hoping someone else can help you with that.,0
2198,Sent from my HTC One M8 using Tapatalk,0
1202,You need to develop that as a habit.,0
216,Most of people start with allround blade and then upgrade only the rubbers to faster.,0
1784,"The ""2"" Hurricane rubbers are a little slower than the ""3"" (since they were designed for the old 38mm ball, or so I've read), so it's going to be a fairly slow rubber to begin with.",0
654,Just giving in my input if you haven't made a choice yet.,0
628,I would go with this one.,0
645,I use Mantra M red in max on forhand on a Sanwei Fextra blade.,0
828,The problem is most Chinese rubbers (including Taiji) only come in one thickness (usually 2.2mm).,0
847,Blitzt (or however you spell it) is another Tensor sold by Palio.,0
1923,What is the price?,0
1305,AK-47 blue is more loop kill and loop drive and needs a very pronounced stroke and not very forgiving.,3
400,"Hi Learnin,Have you ever considered trying Gambler Burst again?",0
3600,I had no control at all!!,0
4164,M2 doesn't feel exactly like T05.,0
447,Omega 7 pro is not very good on Viscaria and Omega 7 Pro is very good on Joola Quadri Aruna.,0
509,TTD member erm is probably the forums largest EJ and it is not even close - no one is even 10 times as close.,0
468,"https://www.prott.vip/Product-Details.a ... =EVOLUTIONWhether or not you believe any or all of this, though...  Iskandar",0
2237,that really doesnt make any sense at all,0
270,I agree with the above - definitely more demanding than MX-P.,2
2025,I guess that is what you're after),0
167,Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks,1
872,"The single sheet has the ""Tension"" logo, the twin pack does not!",0
953,R47 is really different.,0
88,But T80 is less sensitive to it etc.,2
2047,M1 turbo is a cannon and suited for mid distance rallies.,3
642,"With sound technique I can produce a strong opening loop against backspin ball with any of the mentioned Gambler products.Yes you need to make a ""minor"" adjustment for higher or lower throw rubber.",0
4066,"Thx Reb, I did actualy had a quick hit with Rasent 2-3 weeks ago and it felt ok.",0
525,"Who knows how any of these scales work, whether they're linear, how one goes about calibrating instruments, etc.",0

959,"That said, I'm not the best person to ask about why I'm using my current setup.",0
3544,Because tacky rubbers are really different to ESN ones.,0
816,The sponge absorbs booster better and is much cheaper,2
941,Thanks!Edit: You must be really sensitive to sponge hardness since the Taiji sponge is rated at 36 degrees and the Tinarc 5 is rated at 35 degrees.,0
504,"If Ma Long uses H42 then whoever told me Chinese pro use very hard rubbers up to 50 simply misinformed me or I misunderstood.Anyway, thanksP.S.Yesterday I did test of how long my STN holds the ball and got bored holding the racket for 20 sec.",0

286,"Eric T, AUS",0
778,Hmm .,0
2166,Chinese rubbers are best paired with flexible blade.,0
817,The reason I am inclined towards the Chinese style rubbers is due to their tackiness that I felt would assist me with the spin in addition to the control more than the Euro/ Jap style rubbers despite being hard/ mid-hard.,0
4186,But I am back with T05.,0
326,MXP is great as well but it doesn't work too well (for me) during summer months when it's hot and humid out.,3
582,I have now read a little about these rubbers.,0
2947,Do you still have the TBS ?,0
514,The true test is in how much rotation you can get on the ball in real play.,0
385,Mantra M is supposed to be easier to handle.,2
638,Could you provide your opinion on this?Thanks!,0
4333,"thank you big_lou for your respond!c'mon people, nobody else has some info about these rubbers to add?",0
1394,But thats only what ive read without having played that rubber.,0
428,"I will try that and see.I am aware about the link between tack and the hard sponge although my understanding was that, with the Chinese technique, you don't try and engage the sponge fully but go for brush shots with the sponge providing some assistance but never fully compressed.",0
351,I personally felt EL-P was better for blocking and FX-P for looping.,1
1090,Where can I purchase it?,0
4065,"I don't use these in my game generally because its not something that fits in, but I've done it in practice and have been totally amazed how much you really can spin the ball up with it!",0
2621,Iskandar,0
222,"You can also try the XIOM rubbers - they are a long lasting good alternative to tenergy… For example, I like to have a little harder rubber on the bh - thats why I take the PRO series there, but you could also try EUROPE for softer ones...",0
815,I play close (mostly)- mid distance from the table.,0
4372,I think that both are very similar but the Pro has a softer topsheet!,1
251,Hope this helps,0
3427,Rasant is marginally faster and a lighter rubber than M2 so you might prefer it or you could also have a look at Rasant Turbo.,1
158,Well they are certainly not inferior products.,0
927,"I'm not going to try to peel the rubbers off until those rubbers start to go dead, and that won't be for a while since I'm not planning to use this racket full time.",0
59,"To the OP, I would like to ask what he means by the word ""best"".",0

681,But that's not what I like most about it.,0
3426,"You could give either a go, you would probably find either suit an attack game fairly similarly.",2

1169,On amateur level I think it´s a matter of preference and money.,0
2267,they are commercial !,0
92,"Yes, but that is if you are into passive returns.",0
2266,Are they National version rubbers or commercial version that you can get for example from ttnpp for ~$20?,0
1416,Yep is regular rhyzm mor spin and speed than omega 4asia?,0
607,That is why i was looking at the Zero Blue Diamond as a possible replacement BH rubber.I will try to capture video of my play but don't have a tripod for my cell phone so it may not be possible at this time.Any suggestions you can provide will be very much appreciated.Thanks in advance!,0
1431,Compared to Bluefire M2 it's faster and has more feeling.,2
1155,"As for the comparison of Baracuda to Genius, they are pretty close siblings from the same generation, but I found the Baracuda a bit easier to play (softer topsheet/sponge).",1
1882,"Xiom Vega was my first thought as well, Europe version instead, but both should do well.",0
1891,Found it great for most aspects but still a little too fast.,0
323,"If you're looking for harder tensors, perhaps the Evolution MX-P 50 or the new Stiga DNA Pro H could fit.",2
4665,This is IMO of course.Edit - Whilst it id not identical with Rasant/T05 I would throw Calibra into the same advanced looping category.,0
601,"My preference would be a mid-hard rubber so I'll have to ask for that information by calling up Zeropong customer service.Regarding the BH, do you think the Mech-Tek 2.1 mm would be a good choice?",0
446,"The ""National Team"" rubbers in the white packets you find on legitimate vendor sites like Eacheng are just DHS's attempt to cash in on this.",0
701,I have used Burst and X3 Diamond with GearZ sponge.,0
91,"T80 has a little bit more control (for me), less sensitive to spin, but T05 is spinnier.",1
2560,Currently using Omega IV Europe and like it very much.,0
2068,"After that, both rubbers blocks very well and pley well close to the table.",2
4337,With a softer topsheet (and I assume the XIOM ones are softer) you can get spin more easily but brushing more.,0
2116,Cant go wrong with either one.,0
2625,We need R&D!,0
2572,My feeling is that there wasnt much in it.,0
650,The spin is amacing in opening loops with a lower speed but ALOT of spin when i brushes the rubber.,4
1885,"From the 2 rubbers given I would go with Tibhar, but that is hardly a recommendation.",0
1365,"Speedwise, R47 is bouncier than T05 but with lesser spin.",1
472,I have not done a direct comparison between national sheets with orange sheets.,0
4272,"Played pretty close to T64, even the sponge looked a lot like T64 sponge.",2
802,"The newer lot balls, seem whiter, have more bounce (here, I find inconsistencies within balls of the same lot itself), and feel heavier..",0
909,"(And for the sake of full disclosure - the only rubbers I've ever found to be ""too soft"" were that version of Yasaka ZAP with the 33 degree sponge, and Reactor Ckylin.",3
945,You're probably kidding because European 35 degrees sponge would be soooooft.,0
672,There's much more to the rubber that I haven't seen.,0
647,"I tried ALOT of rubbers maybe about 10 rubbers like Tenergy 05, Razka 7, Andro Rasanter R 47 and so on.",0
2557,Sigma I Europe and Sigma II Europe are both nice for backhand or someone who likes a medium forehand rubber.What is your level and background?,1
665,I've tested my friend's Tenergy 80FX so in comparison with Mech-Tek it's similar but Tenergy is much more bouncy and faster.,1
4128,I'll compare it to my T05fx that I've got on now although I think that they may be a tad to fast for my current blade at least Ill be able to compare the 3 kinds of rubbers that are listed in the thread and on the one rig...,0
1501,For the forehand definitely a Chinese rubber!,0
1391,I would suggest this rubber to players who like to have a harder rubber on backhand (around 47.5 degree) while retaining good control.,0
1476,"Sure , They are good rubbers butt i want try orther ruuber that I never used.",0
4170,"You can get the same high arc spins, you can use pretty much the same racket angles.",0
3660,I used s2 all season last year on my backhand.,0
200,"Otherwise I can always recommened the Timo Boll Spirit, since Mr Boll is using that with T05 on both sides, i'm sure Jak can end up in the world top 10 too with the exact same equipment.",0
4365,It's decent rubber but the sponge is a bit hard for my tastes and so I will soon be switching to Omega IV Europe.,0
1782,Spinny or just speed?,0
3648,I've tried S2.,0
795,"Prices are low because - well, Chinese goods can be made at a low price for various reasons.",0
2031,G-1.,0
3665,"Ive glued it on a xiom hayabusa zx which is off.I like it very much,i can push very good with it,its exellent at looping and easy to block with because Its not very spin sensitive.",4
1889,Trouble was I had a strong backhand but a poor forehand and so found myself playing mainly defensive relying on chop and spin.Have decided to get back into the table tennis to keep fit and agile and so want to up my game and have been working a lot on my forehand to get it up level with my BH.,0
920,I'm looking at the Palio Hadou 40+ 42-44 (FH) and AK-47 yellow (BH).,0
637,I've always attributed it to errors in my technique but now think that the rubber may have a part to play in it.,0
1501,"I found that I am able to chop rather well with Andro Hexer Duro, but if controlled and consistent chopping is as important to you as fast topspin a classic such as Donic Coppa would be a more balanced choice.",3
1886,"Near/on table you probably could also use a harder rubber, even chinese, imho.",0
195,Timo Boll agrees btw,0
598,It gives me a little more control than TG2 and still makes my loops vicious.,2
927,"G1 is definitely faster than Baracuda, pretty much equal in spin on stronger strokes.",1
485,I agree that the gearz sponge is too soft so hopefully the normal sponge is the Goldilocks of the 3.,0
386,I have it on one of my blades for the moment and must say it is very controllable.,4
4162,"Mine is red, max thickness on forehand.",0
622,It's not as tacky as you might imagine.,4
2023,You can try to get the tackiest rubber like friendship 729 origin or friendship 729 origin soft and most likely still won't get better results (MORE SPIN!,0
1497,Nexy Calix 2,0
165,No.,0
2141,Its a very good rubber for flicking short balls.,4
1795,"If you want just leave the rubber out for 1 - 2 weeks after PO and there will be no effect other than a very much softer sponge and the rubber should play ""normal"" like as after breaking-in the rubber so that it is tamed.",0
855,"Iskandar/Red, Thank you for your responses and apologies for not being more clear.",0
1393,"Use it until it's worn out and use it as benchmark to which you're leaning toward, the 05 or 64.",0
4353,"The XIOM distributor is in NSW, and as such it's likely to be more popular there.",0

1777,All the neo rubbers are factory tuned and come in vacuum packs.,0
1337,"So change your preferred distance now, keep the same equipment.",0
3556,Primorac with H3 feels like cartoon box.,0
833,It is how you boost them and what ypu use to boost.,0
574,"Form the DHS line, that could be Hurricane 3 (Neo) or Hurricane 8.Friendship/729 have Battle II which is said to be a very decent hybrid rubber (I'm yet to try it).",3
1365,I'm also looking into a new forehand rubber for my defensive game.,0
300,"If not for having the awesome t05 , mxs would be next best thing to me, seems like a durable rubber, even more than t05",2
456,Subjective opinion?,0
4001,"This is my completely impartial view, despite the fact that I've spoken out against Butterfly's pricing numerous times... Now if T05 users feel they can produce spin easier (and with better control) than its competitors, that could very well be true, but there's definitely a ceiling on this rubber's spin capability that I feel is not superior to many rubbers out there.",0
4269,"There is a bit more pace, a bit more spin, and a little more feel.",4
1772,I've used Hurricane 8 for about 2 months now and it is really good for close and mid-range topspins.,3
60,"I won't comment on T25; but T05, T80 and T64 are all great rubbers.",0
100,The extra spin and higher throw seems to be more important to my forehand than my backhand.,0
1494,"My stroke is long naturally, so I think I'm suited for hard tacky.",0
817,You are in the wrong thread.,0
654,Can you say more about the difference between rakza 7 and Mantra M ?,0
801,I've boosted it twice now over a span of several months.,0
800,".. On the other hand, a fellow club-mate bought the same one in Red, around the same time, and it plays kind of weird - The ball seems to just slip of the rubber...I've found major inconsistencies with the balls - More recently, with DHS D40+ (Ding Ning on the box) ...",0
449,Because some of them are red sheets.,0
2169,Euro rubbers.,0

915,"There are cheap boosters out there, Wendy's is something like $10 for 100 ml on ebay.",0
583,Therefore I usually played worse with TG2 than with H3.,1
1774,But: What booster is recommended for Neo Skyline 2?,0
1323,Once they asked Topsy bear what he would prefer - butter or cheese.,0
419,"That advantage, for me, was more than compensated by GA8/50s handling in the short game, blocks, counters.",2

874,"Same markings, same topsheet at least.",0
3602,I went and got Instinct Blade - and 729 FX-C Rubbers on both sides.,0
475,"Incidentally, Ma long uses 42 degrees, most of us shouldn't.",0
1442,"i think I better stay with EL-P, which is good variation for FH rubber enough spin, enough fast and enough hard.",3
1745,And you also could obtain a CJ8000 topsheet and combine it with any other sponge you may like.,0
441,"Not only that, apparently pros who use it also boost the heck out of it.",0
1783,"Seriously, as LordCope says, I think you can just ignore it, you probably won't notice a difference since the effect fades away slowly rather than all at once.",0

407,"Well considering the possible difference in skill and technique, and the fact that anyone can rate, its kind of hard to really be 100% reliable.",0
4096,"I played the last tournament with Rasant on my backhand, ultimately it's too fast for me but it makes a lot of spin with the speed and has enough grip to do just about anything you want against serve, if you have the confidence to use it how it want's to be used and that's something very important with this rubber.",0
415,People tend to think that it helps to spin the ball.,0
258,IMO it is designed for close to the table game.,3

897,"I'm surprised that a tensor could go ""dead"" in a month with only moderate use.",0
1209,I already tried a 50° Tensor on my backhand.,0
647,I'm still waiting for my Sanwei M8 blade to be delivered from aliexpress and I'm hoping that the 1.7mm would be back in stock by then.,0
2046,but way easier to play.,2
750,"Yogi,",0

590,"On the rubber side there may be a conflict between what you want to do, eg fh, chinese style and who you are, eg novice-intermediate and learning.",0
2811,Skyline 2 is more for the close to the table attack and short game although with the right blade you can make up for the lack of mid distance.,3
786,"Not really, vega asia is softer.",2
894,"I thought I would get a tensor or, at least, a more dynamic rubber for my BH so that I could take my game to the next level.",0

379,FX-P is softer and has more catapult.,2
76,Especially since T05 is more than fast enough.,0
290,Ditto with spin based on your stroke - you get what you did - no less and no more.Strong impacts - this rubber is a totally different animal.,0
