3319,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Genius Sound is supposedly a very good rubber but a more up to date version of it would the 5Q sound at the same 37.5 degree.Haven't tried the 5Q sound but the 5Q is a super rubber but imagine it would be too advanced for you at this stage but it can work well for Shakehanders on both sides depending on the blade.There's also the Joola Maxxx 400 which I haven't tried.Safe option.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3333,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3334,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3335,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3336,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
