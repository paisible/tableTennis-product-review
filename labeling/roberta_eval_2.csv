0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"Going to a club may help...There, seems it's possible to find a Tackiness Chop and Tenergy...then you can chop with that rubbers and some others and see ...you get your answers existentially.if you spin more when you play then get a ''spin'' rubber or if you chop more then get a ''chop'' rubber...Lets say, rubbers like Victas 401 or Hurricane 3 are good to do both."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,I'd like to make an emphasis on footwork and practicing techniques and ''reading'' the ball.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,If they are ''good'' then you can use an ''attacking'' rubber for defence easier.Choppin and spinning are both spinning the ball.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Rubbers with less rebound are beneficial for chopping.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Depends how you play and swing.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,You can serve with a lot of spin using pretty much any rubber with good surface grip.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Tacky or not.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"But when off the table, with tenergy or dignics the pushes and chops get touchier."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"More bounce, more speed."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"With deader sponges, say tackiness chop for example, it will help slow the ball down a lot and generally allow for extra safety."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Spin wont be as high... however do you really NEED that additional bit of spin?
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Do you want pure safety and consistency?
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"If you just want max spin potential, get pretty much any new modern rubber out now in max thickness and go to town."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,You might discover that sheer power and spin potential is not the most conducive to landing balls on the table... as for which has more on serves?
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Amateur level that really comes down to individual technique.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Do you brush or engage the sponge at all?
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"Two people might try the same rubber - one says it sucks, the other says it's the greatest ever made!Right now I've got Victas 401Tenergy 64Nittaku hurricane 3 blue turboVictas 07 extra stickyGolden tangoGolden tango psTsp triple spin chopVictas v15Dynaryz acc and acrTackiness chop Elite defense 999More...End of the day..."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,I could play and use any of them!
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"Some are better at this or that, but not enough to say you cant use them."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Really comes down to base speed and desired feel.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,A rubber consists of two parts: The sponge and the topsheet.Most people don't even think about why that is and what the different aspects of those two parts are.The sponge produces mechanical spin by deforming.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"This is what happens when you throw the ball against the angled bat, and the ball begins to spin, even though you have not even moved the bat."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"The ball sinks into the sponge, the sponge is deformed, and then the ball is catapulted out again.The topsheet produces spin by movement."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"If you just had a sticky surface and threw the ball against that angled surface, the ball would not begin to spin at all."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"Spin is only produced if the surface is moved while the ball touches the surface.Now table tennis rubbers have two parts because both of these aspects play a role in the game, but at different times."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,The sponge is mostly used during topspin play.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"It is for this reason that it is easier to topspin with softer sponged rubbers (the activation of the sponge is easier), but pros always play with hard sponges, because their technique is so good that they don't have trouble activating the sponge, and if the hit the soft sponge with their powerstrokes, the ball would go right through it and hit the wood.The topsheet is used during short play, and for serves."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"For this reason, it is as you said, the friction level of the topsheet is decisive for how much spin you can generate in serves and pushes."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,But this is not all.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"If you have a soft sponge, it can happen that the sponge is activated when serving or pushing, and the ball tends to bounce, making it harder to control."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"People tend to compensate for that, resulting in harmless serves."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"This problem tends not to exist with a) hard sponge topspin rubbers (like chinese rubbers or the new chinese-like rubbers) b) chopper rubbers (because they have a thin and/or non-bouncy spongeSo to answer your question, if we talk about serving alone, I would say a chopper or a hard topspin rubber work equally well, but easy to loop rubbers don't work as well."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"(This explanation is not 100% accurate, e.g."
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,"I have not dwelt on the effect of the pimples in, or on people activating the sponge on purpose with high-throw serves, but I think what I wrote will fit in most situations regarding this question)"
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,At average club level around me I know several players who win through high spin during service and the rest of the game.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Everybody plays with different rubber.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,The most difficult to play against are those who know how to send spiny and nospin balls with similar looking motion.Liu Guoliang is known as one of the best servers in the history of TT and he served with short pips.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Also with the 38mm ball.
0,5f6c219629a893d240caed63,chop vs spin rubber -- which characteristics differ?,Just more difficult to do now with short pips.

1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,I've had a hit with both dignics 05 and dignics 09c for the last 2-3 months and i mostly agree with her review.However its NOT worth AUD $130.00 per sheet.
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,PRODUCTION DATE DOES MATTER.
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"Yes, we think it a worthy idea that all the rubber products should indicate manufacturing date (year/ month), same as the plastic balls of three stars grade."
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"ALL the rubber materials are known to display a drop in quality with time, and all the more so after expire time of Four Years."
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,So what?
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,Iskandar
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,dont hate on the panda rabbit and koala haha
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"I did the research a few months ago... and at the time, gram for gram, it would be cheaper to have a racket covering made of solid silver than to use Dignics.I find the price quite utterly absurd."
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"damn, is it like borderline cheaper, or nearing to tenergy rubber price"
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"The Dignics plays better than the silver, though..."
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,Though of course it decreases in value dramatically over 2-3 months...Iskandar
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,It's under RRP here: https://www.teessport.com/search/dignics Still a fair amount though.
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"However, is this a reputable shop?"
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,Teesport?
1,5f6c21e7035f29fdaf67ffa8,dignics 09c vs dignics 05 review,"I've HEARD about them for years, but have no direct experience."

2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,Why????
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"And you've got a choice of 37, 38, 39, 40 AND 41 degrees."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"Not all combinations are in stock, AND the prices differ according to hardness AND thickness."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,Why so many close-to-each-other choices??
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"I wonder who this is aimed at (probably EJs..  ) ... note that this is the ""ordinary retail"" version - the Provincial version also has a similar, if more limited, menu of choices, while the ""blue sponge provincial"" version has only 2.15 available (in three hardnesses)."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,The non-Neo H3 is available in 2.15 and 2.2 also.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,How much faster is Neo compared to the non-Neo?
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"Ordinary H3 turned out to be too slow for me, even after boosting (or at least, I didn't like it), but Haggis says Neo H3 is ""one of the faster Chinese rubbers""."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,I'm not inclined to buy a sheet just to find out.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,There's only one H3 topsheet listed in the LARC (24-108) so the Neo uses the same H3 topsheet (Igor claims this will soon become illegal..  ).Iskandar
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,Speculation: maybe the 2.10 and 2.15mm options are for those who boost.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"Boosting expands the sponge, makes it thicker."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"You'd buy the maximum thickness if you don't boost, or boost lightly."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,Otherwise - I really doubt most people can tell the difference when playing.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,Iskandar
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,I also think that's the reason.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,I don't think there's any noticeable difference between the rubbers of such small difference thicknesses.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"For me, I thought I could feel a slight difference in weight and overall softness feel."
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,The 2.15 felt easier for me to use on my Bh.
2,5f6c21e8035f29fdaf67ffa9,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo 2.15 vs. 2.2,"Unfortunately, I didn’t weigh the differences - but I will on the next exchange."

3,5f6c21f7035f29fdaf67ffb0,TinArc 3 vs AK47 Red,I've actually used TinArc 3 AND AK47 - albeit the blue version - but I'm the last person you'd ask to compare rubbers.
3,5f6c21f7035f29fdaf67ffb0,TinArc 3 vs AK47 Red,All I remember of both sheets is that they were usable - which is true of 95% of the rubbers I've tried.

4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Looking at the page more carefully, it's apparently not soft, but quite hard, and heavy."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Hi guys , I just brought one from Japan, the back cover has a description of this rubber for a aggressive chopper."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Pips of the slightly sticky top sheet are aligned sideways and softer, but the sponge is made hardened as much as possible."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"As a result of this combination, it has suppressed the bounce and strengthened the stability of the chop thoroughly."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The chopped ball draws a low and stable arc ad bounce is minimized on the opponent' s court.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"At time of attack, you can control by yourself more easily and bring out your power."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'll tell you the picture after I have a hit with vs401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I have used it on a Victas Matsushita blade in 1.8mm.During multiball drills, I found it to be as advertised, able to loop well and giving good control in chopping.If I had continued with an off the table shakehands chopping game, this is the rubber I would pick over the many (very many) I have tried that claim to be good for this style."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,For those who already used it: is it some kind of tensor/powersponged rubber?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,In other words: does the rubber try to imitate a speedglued modern defensive rubber?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I Think all victas rubbers are TENSOR made in germany.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"the pimples and the inverted.I Read in a interview that koji said that All products from TSP will be made in japan, and the victas will be from japan and germany."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Victas 401 is made in Germany and has a very light tensor feel to it.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"By that I mean there is some feeling of a small extra snap or kick of the ball off the rubber when looping, but I rate it a mild kick."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"As to imitating a speed glued feeling, it doesn't feel like that to me, but in my opinion, the all out looping tensors don't feel like speed glue either."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thx for the reply, fleet."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It was that kick I was talking about... How do you rate speed vs. spin?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Is it more sppedy than spinny or the other way around?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Or are they holding each other in balance?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thx for the reply, mano."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'd rate it quite even on spin/speed.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Very balanced and controllable.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Might try it in the midseason then, but at the moment I'm (again) quite hooked to my Tenergy64."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,My current setup just feels so natural to me.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Any more reviews of this mysterious rubber?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I am very tempted to order and give it a try myself on my Defplay Senso.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,This is an amazing rubber and probably one of the best if not the best chopping rubber ever.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I tried this on a Victas Matsushita blade last Saturday and bought a sheet immediately.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The spin on chops has to be seen to be believed.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The ball stays very flat on chops and bounces just a little on contact with the table.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Still enough power to attack, I am currently playing with a black 2mm sheet.Still this is not a rubber for everyone as the sponge is quite hard."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It actually reminded me a lot of the old shiny like a mirror meteor 813.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,If you liked 813 you will love the 401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"When hitting the ball there is a quite hard sound, then some delay and then the ball takes off."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The 813 also had this characteristic and it helps to disrupt your opponent's timing.I actually did not play a lot with the Victas tonight as today I played against mostly lower ranked players and literally nobody could loop twice in a row.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Even attempted dropshots bounced on their half of the table first very often.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The big test will be on Wednesday when I play the higher ranked players.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Keep us posted, Elvis."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"sooooo Elvis, how is going with the VIctas?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"So far so good, I posted about playing with the 401 against the higher ranked players in my blog."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Unfortunately I stopped playing with the Victas Matsushita.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Now playing with the 401 on the Victas blade on which it behaves quite different.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Quite a bit faster and a little less spin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Testing again tonight.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I am curious, how fast is this rubber compared to Neo H3 and Palio Thors?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I just orderd Kojis blade and I think that this rubber might be a little too slow on that blade (I am used to Joo Se Hyuk with Thors).
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But I also like the idea of a controlled spinny rubber with some speed...
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I played with the Neo H3 years ago, but never tried the Thor's."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"All I can say about the 401 is, that it is definetly NOT slow!"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Speed is somewhat comparable to Neo H3, if I recall that correctly."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The 401 is a tiny bit more lively than the usual chinese suspects (at least that is my impression), altough it is nowhere near being springy as the usual tensors."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In total I would say, that the 401 is a rubber between chinese and tensor rubbers."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,With its dense 50° sponge it is quite heavy though.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,How tacky compared to H3?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Not tacky but very grippy.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Similarly grippy as Neo H3 I would say.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Sounds nice, I will order one"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Yes 401 is an hybrid between china and japanese rubbers.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thor's is a hybrid, Vega China is a hybrid, 401 is a hybrid."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,All three are pretty hard.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thor's has weird playing characteristics, I like to call it ""crappy"", and did not like it at all."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Vega China is pretty fast, no china rubber can reach to this speed, but its still slower than most modern japanese rubbers."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"401 is just abit slower than Vega China, but still faster then any china rubbers I've played with."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"401 is best to chop with, and, if you use an elastic blade, pretty darn good to play topspin too."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I like it more than Vega China.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Thanks Klaus123!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,What thickness do you need to loop with it?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Is the sponge as hard as the Vega China?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Today I tried 401 a little more.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Difficult to sat anything since I am all new to the blade I keep it on (Victas Matsushita).
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But this combination is very controlled, yet loops and counters carries lors of speed."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But with my technique loops are a bit toothless - not enough spin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Also, I get more spin on pushes from my Thors."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"However, FH chopping is very good, but I don't know if the rubber has much to do with that since the blade is fabulous for choppng."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I might move this rubber to my spare Joo-blade, then I will noe more about it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Curious to hear you further feedback.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Seems to be a technical issue, because I am generating loads of spin with loops with the 401 on my VKM."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I can nicely switch between brush looping for high spin balls and more direct hitting at loops for more power.Compared to springy ESN rubbers, you always have to perform a proper stroke at loops."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But if you do, you are rewarded with well controllable, spinny and fast loops."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"This is one of the best features of the rubber, I always know in advance, what I can get out of it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Can someone compare it to something like a xiom vega asia?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Speedwise and gripwise.I'm having problems brushlooping with ESN rubbers because of the lack of grip compared to chinese rubbers.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,i thought tenergy was an auto pilot rubber.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,well at least thats how it feels to me...
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I had bought a sheet of red 1.8 mm Victas VS-401 about 4 months back and didn't have time to work with it till now because I was trying to get ready for a big tourney recently.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Then the other day I found out the red 1.8 mm Rakza 7 Soft I've been using went on a good sale, I decided I had better give it the VS-401 a good test because I didn't want to order more Rakza and THEN find out later that the VS-401 worked better.My biggest problem lately has been that I have a hard time chopping back fast and/or spinny loops to my inverted forehand."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I figured that based on the reviews, if ANY inverted was going to help, it would be the VS-401.My Rakza is getting worn (3 months times 125 hrs per month), and so I took it off and glued it on the VS-401."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"My first impressions were that it was slower, but not super slow, and made the paddle much heavier."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Inverted chops were landing more consistently, but inverted topspins suffered from going into the net very often, possibly due to a throw angle difference, perhaps compounded by the lower speed."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Spin on serves was good, but noticeably not as good as the Rakza, and I would say less than the Narucross GS Soft I had before that."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"According to the person I was hitting with, I had less spin on the VS-401 on loops or chops as well."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"After a couple hours the paddle was getting heavy, and then I lost a game to a player I usually win against, so after that game, I took the VS-401 off and put the old Rakza back on, went back to playing the match, and won the next 3 games.I think that I could adjust to the throw angle in time, but the weight really slowed me down on my oversized blade, to the point where I don't think I was swinging it fast enough to get the speed or spin from it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I suppose I could reduce the size of the blade, but its really been chopping well on backhand and at the table on forehand, so I'd rather leave it alone.I guess I need to find another way to solve my ""can't chop back spinny loops"" problem."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The Vega Asia is much more lively, faster and has very high arc - unfortunately also with blocks."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,At first I had the same problem.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Then I hit the ball when it was going down instead at the climax.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,This resulted in a much more powerful topspin with heavy rotation.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Taking the ball this way forces me to hit it strictly tangentially.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,At the climax there is more lateral hitting due to my deficient technique.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"At the moment I am staggering between T05 (my favorite, but the price !)"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,and the 401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In addition I tried* the Vega Japan, very good rubber but not as spinny as the other ones (=> less direct point upon dirty servings)."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,My last experiment will be a classical H3 drowned in Falco long-term booster.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,* p.s.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,taking the costs for my searches into account I could play T05 for the next 10 years  .
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"After reading about it on the German forums I ordered a 2 sheets of yasaka era, 1.5 and 2.0 mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Quite surprisingly the 2.0 version is more than a little bit like the victas 401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Amazing spin on chops, similar sound when hitting the ball and decent on attacks."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I think I would have a hard time saying which is which in a blind test.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Yasaka era highly recommended, I am now using the version with 39-40 degree sponge."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thanks Elvis56  That version is made by Palio in China, and is not an official Yasaka Japan product."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I've used it in the past (many years ago) and I did like the feeling and the spin, but the sheets did suffer from consistancy and quality from batch to batch."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"They are certainly not up to the Yasaka Japan standard, but of course if you get a good sheet, that's not really an issue."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I've just starting using the 401 myself (1.5mm), and absolutely love it... will review later."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Well, I had one in 2,0mm red."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I found the attacking capabilities of the Victas 401 very good.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,You could really load up the spin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But in defense and service it lacked the spin I've got with my Tenergy 80 (in 1,7)."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"You need to be spot on to chop a good ball, otherwise you get a quite harmless ball."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,And as a defender it's not possible to be always in the right place.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Even pushes weren't loaded like they are with Tenergy 80.I found it to be a modern defensive rubber with an emphasis on attack.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But it's not for more defensive modern defenders.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Lorre, you might need to break it in for a few more sessions perhaps?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I find that spin on pushes is amazing with Victas, that is where it really shines (along with slow spinny loops)."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But it might need a soft blade for that.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I have only tried it on my VKM.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Yes I found the same too... my pushes are very heavy, which is one of the things I thought it excelled at.Perhaps it's because of a slightly different stroke..."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I push mine like with a Chinese rubber, just brushing the surface, but with T80 you need to dig it on more, then you get the heavy backspin."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Haggisv, have you tried it in 2,0?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,How big is the difference?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I get some pain in my wrist and shoulder after playing and when I changed to VKM with 2,0 mm >401 it got worse."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The over all weight is about the same as my previous setup but the balance is different.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I am thinking of trying it in 1,8 mm or 1,5 mm but I wonder how much slower it would get and if its ability to generate would change."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Any input?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I used the rubber for +-16 hours (2 weeks), so it would need to be broking in, wouldn't it?I found, when I pushed with a longer stroke, the resulting ball was heavy enough, but still not as heavy as with my Tenergy."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,As a defender this is not ideal: my stroke with my Tenergy is shorter (more with the wrist).How do I only brush the surface instead of letting it dig in?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,To bad they don't make it in 2.2 mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"2.0mm is probably enough for most people, as it's feel quite firm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I think the very short pimples make it feel former too.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I can loop quite effectively even with 1.5mm, although I'll probably change to 1.8mm or 2.0mm for that little extra on hard loops."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,1.5mm is good enough for topspin on the VKM blade.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Since the tensor top sheet of the 401 is thick, there is no need for me to use thicker sponge than 1.5mm for proper topspin game."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In addition with 1.5mm sponge you will have less weight, more control and the blade will not be head heavy."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Today i got my new black 401 1.8 mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Even if it seems i'm the last forum user to test it (  ) i'll make my review soon  I'm going to glue it to my spare VKM st with p4 0.5 on bhI decided to get it to try a true defensive rubber, since i always used offensive rubbers with thin sponge like vega pro, vega asia, vega japan, m2, jp01... and see if i like it's control and how it plays overall."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I hope the spin is at the same level as vega pro (but i really fear it could lack some after trying a vs01 from a friend and reading some review...) and the speed is somewhere there (of course it will be less...) but with better control above all on chops... also, since i have been playing with high throw rubbers from the beginning, i'm interested to try some medium/low rubber...I'm glueing the rubber tomorrow, i'll make you know soon"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Don't feel bad I haven't tried it yet either.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But, I have a sheet coming to me soon."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Also just ordered the Victas Koji Matsushita Defence.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Going to try the Victas 401 with 1.8 and TSP P1r in 1.5 and see how that works.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I use 2.0 on VKM - perfect (but heavy) match.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But ot takes some time to get used to.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Good luck!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Mmmmm... ok... i tried this rubber twice, and it's just so strange, so different from what i'm used."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"One of the strangest rubbers i've ever seen...It's a quite hard rubber overall, the topsheet is thin and not too hard, but the sponge is really hard."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I had almost the impression that it wants to be an european rubber that plays like a chinese rubber!Surprisingly it resulted somehow a little faster than my VP (and it's 1.8 vs 2.0) above all when flat hitting, when tospinnign it was probably the same speed with both."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The throw is really low, blocking is a joy, fast looping near the table was nice also, but i'm not really used to low throw and low arc rubbers since i usually play vega pro..."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"It's relatively spin insensitive but capable of decent spin on loops, but not really too much, in fact it's better when cutting."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"IMHO the problem is that if you use the topsheet well you can create a really good spin, so there's good spin on services, cuts and slow brush loops, but when you engage the sponge it becomes quite fast but with low spin."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Anyway, even in its strong areas i found the spin to be less than with my vega (which is even a little bit old now...).Only things i really liked were the chop and the fish from behind."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The fish was quite easier than with my usual rubbers and enabled good variation; it went the same way for my chop.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"My impression on it is that the sponge is so firm that you don't engage it at all, so there's not strong rebound and so it's quite good to absorb the power of the loop or to put more power in your chop.Counterloop same as the topspin, good speed but low spin and low arc...Overall i guess it could be a nice rubber for a certain type of chopper, since it's quite nice when defending from behind, but i don't think i like how it works on the fh offense or at least i think it doesn't suit my way to play the forehand... and it feels so unlinear with its' throw and way to play, depending on how you use the sponge."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"And at last, i rely on the huge spin (at my current level) i can create with my fh.Definitely a strange rubber, some may love it and some may hate it, depending on how they play and how it suist them."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I think v01 is a better choice if you want a more linear, faster allround rubber (since it lacks quite a bit of spin too) but with grat control and overall play."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thanks RevanII, you've summed it up very nicely, and this ties up somewhat with my own experience, and is pretty much the reason it works perfectly for my strokes and style.My loops tends to be brush loops as I come from sticky Chinese rubbers, and I find this rubber is very spinny for this stroke."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I also find that the throw is high for that stroke.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I suspect you engage the sponge much more on your loops, making the throw much lower for you.What I can't do with Chinese rubbers is counterloop against heavy topspin, as their throw becomes too high, but with the 401 I can do this perfectly as the throw drops a lot when looping harder.Because I use a balsa blade with a soft feel, the difference in throw may be a lot less sudden than with regular blades."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Yes, i think you are right."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In fact, fully brushed loops have a good spin and high arc.I suppose that if you have a REALLY good topspin, with very strong body motion (so a professional quality topspin) then you might engage the rubber the best and find it good for topspins in general."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In fact, the few loops i tried with 110% of my power were really fast and the spin was nice, but with a medium controlled topspins you really don't go anywhere near other moderne euro/jap rubbers...Quite defensive and designed for really strong loops... or really slow and spinny...I guess it may be quite nice with some booster  actually i never tried it... if i did i probably play with H3 anyway...Cheers"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It would be interesting if you got to test it in 2.0 mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"That might help something, especially concerning brush looping."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Most of my opponents (even players far better than me, even a player in top 150 in Sweden with SP on his FH  ) blocks my brush loops (far) out and says they rarely meet someone with that much spin on their loops."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I do have a good brush loop but I think it is more that they underestimate the spin generated compared to the arm motion they see me do.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I did try it in 2.0mm, but I found it to be too bouncy and lively (which really surprised me actually), but perhaps this is not the case on a non-balsa blade."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The blade must make a big difference.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"On my VKM the 2,0 mm is everything but lively"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"That's good to know...it must be the interaction with the Re-Impact blade... with 1.8 it's perfect, with 2.0mm too lively."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I got my Victas 401 in the mail a couple days ago.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Haven't got it out of the package yet.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But I'll tell you what.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Just squeezing it thru the package the sponge feels hard as Hell.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I hope to get the rest of my stuff from OOAK either today or Monday.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Does anyone know how much a VS>401 differs in weight between 2,0 and 1,8?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I would like my bat a little lighter...
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I bought a new VS 401 in 1,5 mm since it seems 402 will not be available in Another month."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"1,5 mm compared to 2,0 mm is noticably lighter (very good for the pain in my elbow when attacking)."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It is also more direct in some way.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The sound is ""hard"" even at low impact or blocks."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Loops are of course a Little slower but still with good spin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Blocking is a lot easier as wel as pushing over the table and playing short.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Serves is a Little less spinnier of course but it is easier to return servers.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Over all it is, like expected, easier to play with over the table but attacks doesn't come with as much spin or speed."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But the big difference, and the big advantage, is when chopping from distance  ."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"This is far more easier with 1,5 mm than 2,0 mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Chops tend to land about where I want them to land on the table and I can easily vary the spin from Heavy back spin to no spin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It is just soooo fun to chop with this setup    .
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I only tried it one session yet, so I can't really be all sure yet, but for now it feels like I will keep it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I need to work on my attacks but that I need to do anyway  .
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I need better length and placement.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,And I need more forward motion with my whole body.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But it is still ok to attack with it.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"And my BH attacks are better with 1,5 than 2,0."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I loved the 1.5mm for chopping and blocking as well... it's for looping that made me try 1.8mm and 2.0mm, and 1.8mm was the best compromise for me."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I might go with 1,8 as well, bit first I want to try 402 in some version."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I have tried it for another session with other opponents.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Conclusions: Significant lighter, much more control, lower throw and more difficult to loop with."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But a true delight to chop with.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I am not sure if I can live with the difficulties I have when trying to loop with it.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,My elbow still hurts (need to work on my texhnique).
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The are as spinny as ever but much less speed.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But it might be an adjustment thing.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I will keep it for now since it is so fun to have that kind of control but as soon as VS 402 is available I will go for the harder of those two in 1,8 mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I've been using the 401 for our whole season, and it's been my most succesful season ever, so I'm very happy with this rubber.Although I've already shared my thoughts on this rubber in this thread, I've summarised my thoughts into a complete review of the Victas VS>401 here."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thx for the review, haggisv."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,This tempts me to try the 401 once again.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I tried the 2.0 version and indeed, it was very good for looping, but not controlled enough for chopping or pushing."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Sometimes the chop/push was spot on, most of the times there wasn't enough spin on it (maybe because the ball left the blade sooner than imparting spin was possible for me)."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"If I want a jack of all trades, do I need the 1.8 version then?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,@other users: is there a considerable difference in tackiness between the red and black versions?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I remember I've tried the red version and it was almost non-tacky.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I will probably get myself a 1,8 mm black by the end of this week..."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I use 1.5 for the moment and have a competition tomorrow, after that I will most likely change to 1,8 mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Also, I play with an un-sealed blade for the moment."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I will also seal it, that might do a little...."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Been using 401 for about 4 months now and thought it was a good rubber.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I don't chop with the FH much.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I did think it is not fast enough for my game though.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,And I still think that Rakza 7 has more spin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Was thinking about going back to the Rakza 7 but I'm going to try a sheet of the Donic Bluefire JP03.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I've heard a lot of good things about it.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Well keep y'all updated soon.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I ordered a blade for a friend yesterday who's I guess a US 1700 old fashioned looper (not much of a backhand).
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I had a free choice to order him any setup I wanted in his budget and ended up going with the JO shaped Donic senso carbon and VS 401 1.8mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I was considering both of the 402's but lack of information and reviews in the end made me go with the original 401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Went with magic carbon on the backhand, also 1.8mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'll finally get to try this famous rubber myself as a bonus  .
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I have ordered a 1,8 m black, will try it tomorrow if things go as planned."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"haggisv,Thanks so much for your review."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I have read it once and plan to read it again over the weekend.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I just ordered a sheet of Victas VS>401 1.5mm from a local vendor near my home town for one of my Joo blades.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I should receive the sheet of rubber in a couple of days.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"After reading your review, I couldn't resist the temptation."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For me, chopping with Tenergy 64 is wonderful, when I am in position."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Unfortunately, with my very slow footwork, which is of course inevitable with age, I am out of position way too often."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I need to be far from the table both to allow the ball to slow down and to let be able to chop under to ball to gets lots of backspin.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I am thinking that with Victas VS>401 in 1.5mm I can be closer to the table, and so I don't have to move as much."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Also, the slower Victas VS>401 will give me a little more time to get into a neutral position between shots."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I am not sure if this is a good idea, but it should be very interesting to give a try.Steven"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I hope you can make it work for you too birding&table.tennis!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I finally got to use this rubber on that combo I built for my friend.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,As a total combo its probably the best bat I've ever used and very forgiving.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It reminded me of carbonman's combo which has that same feeling.It was the Donic waldner sensor carbon (Jo shape) with 1.8mm vs 401 on fh and 1.8mm magic carbon on backhand.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The blade is very good, you wouldn't know it was carbon, it has quite a lot of flex."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"This blade is a favourite of the_theologian , he's a guy that has a great feel for a good blade."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Its essentially a donic allround allplay with thin carbon layers just above the core, not a fast blade but the combo was much more potent than my defplay with tg3.."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Anyway hard to say if the awesome was more about the blade or vs401 but the combination was perfect.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Magic carbon is pretty much like mark v like most people say but I felt its a little better than mark v. I'll buy this same combo for myself next season.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Just switched to this rubber 1.8 for the first time.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I've been playing with Xiom VEga Europe 2.0 for the longest time but have had a 2.2mm for 1 month.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Looping/driving was very easy with the 2.2 rubber and spinny.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I had lots of trouble adjusting chops to land on the table as it tends to go long.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Passive chops were also less forgiving with the 2.0.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I was about to switch back to 2.0 but decided to order Victas VS>401 and give it a try.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Played for an hour with it and just a joy to chop with.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I could really follow through without 'babying' it to land at the table.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Thus was getting heavier backspin that mostly landed deep in opponents table.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Loops were much slower but still spinny.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Took a bit more effort too but I didnt mind.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I did try a change of tactic and did a close to table drive/slight top spin and that was very easy to perform and very controllable.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Pushes were easy and blocking was easy and controllable.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I played 1 match i with someone I usually go 5 games with but win.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"This time, even playing with a new rubber, I won easily 3-1 with games 11-6 ."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,HE won first game as I was still adjusting.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,His style is primarily fast with drives and loops.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Did not get chance to test if rubber was sensitive to spin as I didnt have anyone to play last night with spinny serves.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Will try the next few nights.Weight was surprisingly slightly heavier than my 2.2 Xiom Vega Europe even though this was just 1.8Overall impressions , I think I'm switching over and making this rubber my primary forehand rubber paired with my Grass Dtecs."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I found the vs-401 very fast actually.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Its got a very loud crack sound from the sponge when you really give it some.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Granted the blade I was using it on is a least all+ so a faster blade than most you guys have tried it on.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm also used to playing an offensive game with a much slower blade and rubber.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The owner of the vs401 now has a swollen upper lip by the way Lol.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,He went to block a loop I hit with his new blade but it caught the top edge of his (old) blade after it bounced on the table.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"It then continued on and hit his lip, got tingly and swollen."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"This passes my official ""can it give you a fat lip rubber power test"" Tm.My friend isn't a chopper by the way but has always used Chinese rubber for a general allround club game with a very good serve and I had no confidence a normal tensor was going to be the right rubber for him."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I am confident now after using it that vs401 was exactly the right choice.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"He's just like a typical average life long club player, he doesn't have enough power to max out a hard sponged rubber like this but it still served well for him and made good spin when he looped."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Best thing about it for him is that it has excellent control and is very forgiving.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I've just put a sheet of this on my blade and had a practice on my robot.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It feels fantastic!!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Very controlled, with a lot of spin but best of all, it has a really nice feel when you hit the ball."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I'm using it in 1.5mm which probably helps with this, but I don't feel as if I'm losing any speed or spin as a result."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm very pleased with it indeed.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"i play with V>01 2mmi never said this before, but it has same spin like tenergy 05, and has better control."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,(and faster little bit +15%)well played Victas!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Victas V>01 or Victas V>401?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"So im using it for like 2 months now in my FH, strange rubber."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I dnt chop a lot so i cant realy tell how it chops.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Where it realy shines is BLOCK, it does miracles in block."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Where it sucks (my all wood blade dsnt help here either) is the top spin in a chopped ball.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It is excelent for the hits and im still trying to understand where is that spin that everyone mentions.Pushing aint bad .
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Strange you're using a FH rubber that's garbage for two months.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Do you like to torment yourself?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"actually i love the security that gives me in blocks, especially when off balance or not in the ideal position.Is the best blocking rubber i have ever use.Plus aint bad either in service reception (my biggest disadvantage) so i give this tricky F*** some times."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I can't quite understand how you're not getting high spin on loops, because it's one of the spinniest rubbers around."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Brush looping gives you the most spin, but even if I loop it more euro-style, I still get loads of spin."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"To be honest, i also found 401 quite unspinny overall, meaning that in order to obtain the same spin of, let's say, bluefire-vega-baracuda... you have to use much more force, both on cuts and loops.Great control tough..."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I certainly don't doubt your opinion, but it must come down to the different strokes, because I've tried some of these rubbers, and for me, the 401 leaves it for dead when it comes to spin, and I'm not the only one in our region that uses this rubber for it's high spin."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Perhaps the blade makes a difference too?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I don't know, of course it depends from different strokes, but you may also be right about the blades... i tried it on VKM, maybe it works better with harder blades?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I don't really know...
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I sold mine to a blocker that uses it on the BH and it helped his game quite a bit
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I use the CORNILLEAU Gatien Glory OFF Rosewood so maybe it dsnt give a lot of impact time to load spin(together with my crap technique)
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Hi.What thickness of VS>401 do You recommend form me?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I play VKM+Curl P1R 1mm and actually Hexer Powersponge 2.1 which is very hard to chop with.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I mainly defend with both sides, chop in every distance, if my opponent makes mistake I sometimes try to loop or smash."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I think about 2mm and 1.8mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Do you think 1.8 is enough to make loops, mainly near the table?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Won't it be too slowly?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,On the other hand 2.0 could be too fast to chop with.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I use the 401 in 1.8mm, but on a balsa blade, which has a very soft and springy feel, so I found 2.0mm a little had to control."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The VKM does not have such a soft and springy feel at all, so I would suspect on this blade the 2.0mm would give you enough control for chopping, and give you decent attack potential."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"It's an educated guess though, I have not tried it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I ave used 2.0, 1.8 and 1.5 on a VKM."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,To me 2.0 was too heavy and that was the main reason for trying thinner.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,1.8 is the perfect middle way.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,You can loop almost as good as with 2.0 (1.5 is not even close in this aspect I think) and you can chop almost as good as with 1.5 mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,1.8 is much better for chopping than 2.0.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Only problem I had was blocking and counter looping, but that has more to do with the rubber than the thickness."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,For you 1.8 or 1.5 would be the best.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Start with 1.8.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Since Def-attack has actually tried it on a VKM, I'd trust his recommendation better than mine,"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I read the same opinion as Def-attack's one.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,That's why i think about 1.8.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Do you think it will be very slowlier than Hexer Powersponge 2.1?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I don't have to kill by loops, just attack after opponent mistakes  If it will be possible to do loops near the table it will be enough speed for me."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I almost never loop further than 1-2 metres from table On the other hand my VKM is only 83g weight, so lighter and slower than the heavier ones"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I have never tried Hexer Powesponge...
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Def-attack, I found your YouTube and watched some videos."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I definitely chop more often than you.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'll buy the 1.8 VS>401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,If it will be too slowly I will buy 2.0 next time  Thanks for help.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm seriously considering trying this rubber out.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I know that this rubber is very good for digging the ball over the table, in a chop push style, its also good for away from the table chopping."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I tend to use very similar shots to Gionis, when im at the table, I either dig the ball in a pushing rally to set up an attack, or if the ball is returned long enough, I will loop, either a slow spinny loop or a faster more ripping loop drive."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I like to load up on the spin on my serves and attack 3rd ball quite often too.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"When receiving serve, I tend to loop when its long, chop the ball back too, and if I have a short serve given to me I like to flick the ball in an attacking manner.Away from the table I like to wait for the ball to drop a bit and then chop it back, I also like to counter topspin occasionally, but a shot I do tend to do a bit is fishing the ball back when im away from the table too, placing the ball around the table."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Would this rubber suit my style?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I guess its a fairly similar set of shots that Gionis executes on his forehand.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I have been playing with 2.0mm Tibhar Evolution MX-S for the last 5 months.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Would I be best using 2.0mm on the 401?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,My blade is Joo Se Hyuk blade.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Or do you feel 1.8mm would be better suited to my range of shots?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It is a very good rubber for that!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But it is heavy.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"If you chop more than just a few times per match, you might want to consider 1,8 mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,This is very ggod for chopping but also good for looping.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The 2.0 mm version is heavier and gives you more power in attacks but you loose a lot of control for chopping.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,THe throw is high on this rubber so it is not the most easy one for counters.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But control is still good for fishing.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I used it on a VKM-blade, not on Joo, so I really don't know if the throw would be very high on Joo, but on VKM I felt it was a bit too high."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I changed to DHS Hurricane 3-50 (medium), which is a very nice rubber."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Is there any significant difference between the red and black sheets of this rubber?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Or are they identical?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"As with any rubber that's got some tack, the black always has a bit more tack, although with German/Japanese sheets the difference is much less."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm wanting to create a second bat where I chop using a double inverted racket.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,For example Joanna Drinkhall (Paul Drinkhall's wife) uses tenergy 05 on both sides in a 1.7mm and a 1.9mm sponge and she chops and attacks with it.I want a set up like that to see how i'd get on with it.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I'd use a Joo se hyuk blade I think, but I cant decide on the two inverted rubbers."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I currently use Evolution MX-S on the FH so wondered about using that on the BH with a thinner sponge.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,But then I also thought about Tenergy in a thinner sponge for my BH.Then I looked at the Victas VS 401 for BH chopping and blocking and occasional attack.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But couldnt make up my mind at to what thickness of sponge.But then I also thought about defensive inverted rubbers (stiga chop and drive, donic slice 40, super defence etc etc)I can't work out what would be the best way to go for choosing a rubber for my BH that is inverted but I still want to chop with!Any advice appreciated!"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The best way is always,Borrow sample rubber from friends and try it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"And, sorry, off topic,To ""drown"" You further to they way of EJ, these known to be great for chopping style."

4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Other than, obviously, speed, how do 401 compare to Tack 2?Sent from my T1X Plus using Tapatalk"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Alex, can you compare 1.5mm VS>401 to TSP Triple Spin Chop in 1.0-1.3?"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,my trusted fingerometer says the black sheet has a slightly harder top sheet.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It could be that my black sheet is newer than the red sheet.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,No significant differences otherwise.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Are you guys still using 401?.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm playing a little tournament in a couple weeks and only have a 4 year old tg3:P. I built a bat for a guy when 401 first came out and it was amazing so probably go that way unless something more amazing came out since.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Will be my (and out entire clubs) first hit of a plastic ball too.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,We are bringing our best ever team so I hope theres not enough difference to cost us games.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm still using the 401 (in 1.8mm black).The TSP is more tacky and also considerably slower.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I tried the 401 2.0 briefly with Joola CWX blade.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Some have said that it's very spinny, others say, it's not spinny at all."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,For me it felt too slow compared to T05 - the speed difference is big.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It might work better with balsa or other faster or bouncier blades.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"It felt ok to play with, but I was not at home with many shots."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I propably try it with JSH blade later.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Spin was ok, but less than T05."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"After a few years with the VS401 1.5mm on the BH, i switched to a Nittaku Fastarc G-1 1.4mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Main reason for the switch: the weight and a new blade 12g heavier than my previous blade.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The G-1 is a little bit softer and has more bounce, but i still can do my aggressive pushes with heavy backspin."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Maybe a little bit less spin, but enough for most opponents (unless playing with the G40+ ball  )."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,And the topspin is a little bit easier.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I have a question about the speed of Victas VS > 401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For curiosity, I put a two year old sheet of this rubber (1.8mm) on one of Joo blades."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Even though the sheet was two years old, I used it very little, perhaps for just 4 or 5 practices."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The rubber felt surprisingly soft.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"When I performed a simple bounce test, it was just slightly slower than a one-year old sheet of Tenergy 80-FX on another Joo blade."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In other words, the rubber was rather fast."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Since I liked the Victas VS > 401 for chopping on my Joo blade, I order a new sheet, also 1.8mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"This surprised me too, as the new sheet of Victas VS > 401 was so much slower, being only slight faster (using the same bounce test) than my backhand rubber, i.e., TSP Curl P1R, 1.4-1.7mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I am curious if anyone else has seen such a large difference between the speed of old and new sheets of Victas VS > 401.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The softening of the rubber I did expect, based on a post by haggisv, but the change in speed was a big surprise to me.Steven"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I've been using this rubber for several years now, and don't experience that much difference in speed at all."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,There IS however a lot of difference in speed depending on how much you engage the sponge on your loop.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The rubber is indeed quite slow when you only engage the topsheet (like in your bounce test and other shots that only brush the ball), but as you engage the sponge it's got good speed, just a little below something like Tenergy 05, but more than traditional rubbers like Sriver, Mark V, etc.A bounce test on a new sheet always feels really slow, as the tack takes off all the speed, but if you loop harder with it you get the speed."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"haggisv,Thanks also for this helpful post."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For me, the difference was huge for both the old and new sheets at very low speeds."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"However, at high speeds, when looping I could not tell the difference in speed."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,My practice partners said the same thing.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The Victas VS > 401 sure is a very nice rubber.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For chopping, my favourite aspect to this rubber is that it is easier for me to perform heavy chops, compared to my Tenergy 80-FX."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"In terms of the level of backspin, one of my practice partners said that I generate more backspin with the Tenergy, and two other couldn't tell the difference."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"My practice partners didn't notice any difference in consistency between my chops, and one said that my chops are lower with the Victas VS > 401, and the other two said there was no difference."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Also, my impression is that I can control the placement of my chops a little better with the Victas VS > 401."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I still like the feel of the Tenergy a little more, and of course my loops are faster with the Tenergy.Thanks again.Steven"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Would Victas VS > 401 1.8mm be suitable for a 70/30 ration in favour of defense?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I like to vary levels of backspin on my chops (many of my chops are heavy) and use my defense to setup my offense.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"When the opportunity arises, I like to put the ball away within 1-3 shots."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I'm attracted to this rubber for its spin potential, but I'm concerned about its put away power."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I've actually ordered a sheet of this but now I'm having second thoughts.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm tempted to cancel my order and get Tenergy 64 in either 1.7 or 1.9mm.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Does anyone know how much a sheet with 1.5 sponge weighs in at?I have the 1.8 version cut to over-sized blade, and it weighs 53-55 grams."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Anyone have a sheet also cut to oversize that can share the weight?

4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Thanks jok!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Now if only i had recorded the weight of 1.8!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,For me the 401 is soooooo awesome... but a bit heavy if i wanted to used short pips on the backhand as well.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For my current setup of 1.8 + ox pips, the weights stay in the 175-183 range."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,With short pips that can go up over 200 grams!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"But after trying so many other rubbers, for me the 401 is way above the rest."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Great short game control, enough power for looping and the chop accuracy/control is unparalleled when factoring in all its other advantages.I suppose rubbers like tackiness chop or juic 999 elite are good for chopping as well, yet they lack power and spin when doing serves or blocks."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,They make it safer -- for both user and opponent!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I feel 401 raises the stakes a bit and requires each player to be more precise.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"With tackiness chop, I can probably return balls easier, although the variation and subtleties are not as good nor is the spin as high."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I'm wondering how much of those attributes are lost when moving to 1.5.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For reference, I am now chopping or pushing like 90%+ balls."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Classic defense and loving it!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,So would the 1.5 401 be a better match?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I've tried all three thickness.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The 1.5mm is clearly the best for chopping, but you can only really brush loop or hit, powerlooping will bottom it out."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,1.8mm is significantly better for attack but definitely not as easy to chop with.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The 2.0mm is not too different from the 1.8mm, you can just loop harder and it won't bottom out at all."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"For mainly chopping I'd go for the 1.5mm, because it's fantastic for this."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I can chop with all three after some adjustment, so I suppose you do adapt, but the chopping was clearly the easiest with the 1.5mm."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I would agree it's quite unique, not other rubber can chop so well yet attack with so much power."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I like that it's also not too tacky... with the actual tacky rubbers like juic 999 or tsp triple spin etc.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Those collect dust all the time, even just being put onto a counter for a short while."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The 401 is just as grippy but doesnt have the dust vacuum problem!
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Man, victas should get me to be their spokesman -- I'm just spouting off about how great it is all the time!"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I've tested it against tenergy 05, 64, 80 and mx-s, fx-p etc."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Also xiom rubbers and donic etc.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"And for my current blade, the 401 whoops them all!"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Spin on serves alone is quite a bit heavier, but when receiving I dont feel it's any touchier than the aforementioned rubbers."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Maybe the hard sponge helps kill off the pace and control the short game, along with the slight surface tack."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I will say though, I did test it on a slower chopping blade and was not totally enamored with it."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I think that had to do more with the overall feel and my liking for the other defensive blade of mine.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I play with it on a walnut/basalt/spruce/spruce/spruce blade which feels very similar to the old kim Kyung ah blades yet at a higher speed.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,It is very springy... so all I have to do is focus on brushing the ball and the blades rebound handles the speed for me.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I've got 4 sheets of the 401 now all in 1.8, so I may give 1.5 a try when those give out."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Or I get bored one day...
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Much difference between red and black?
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Hello everyone, someone who played with 401,can compare it with butterfly spinart, thank you all"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Hello everyone, someone who played with 401,can compare it with butterfly spinart, thank you all"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I played with both, only for a brief period of time."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,The Spinart requires a better technique and so has therefore less room for error.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,I can't remember more: it has been a while since I played with Spinart.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Spin art feels harder, is faster when applying power but slightly deader when doing passive or low force hits."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"401 is quite a bit slower also, though seems to offer better control and as lorre said, ease of use."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Basically to my feeling, the spin art is closer to a chinese style rubber and the 401 leans a little more toward the euro variety."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"If I wanted to be an attacker, I would go with spin art as I used for a good number of months and 5 sheets worth."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"If I wanted to focus on chopping with an attack here and there, I'd stick with 401."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Or if you wished to play an all-round control game.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thanks to the answers, I use on the backhand to mainly cut and block, but I really like the hard Chinese style feeling, I will try the 401 I do not think of other alternatives to spinart now out of production"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"The 401 has a softer topsheet, which makes it feel softer and allows it to really grip the ball on brush loops or chop."
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Even the spinart has high and spaced interior dots (compared to tenergy) the feeling is not very hard, the only solution is to play it and see how it behaves, alternatively there is also the donic blugrip v1 but it is 50 degrees I do not think it feels as hard as spinart or 401"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,You may like the joola golden tango then.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,To me it felt the most chinese like of the hybrids I've used.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,Took more oomph to get the ball moving etc.
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,As a side note: My understanding is that Spin art is being discontinued (and replaced by Dignics 09C).
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"Thanks to everyone for the advice, I will start to try all this material as soon as it is possible, I write from Italy, the situation to train is still complicated, we hope to start a greeting soon to everyone!"
4,5f6c2215035f29fdaf67ffbe,Victas Vs>401,"I confirm that the spinart is out of production, but I do not think the 09c is its direct successor, to make a spinart 2 (modern version) should use a much harder xsponge, and a geometry of the inner dots more control oriented, it would be a dream for me, but I think it will never happen!, it would sell too little, which I think is the reason why the spinart is out of production!"
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,45 should just have a softer sponge and should be a little bit slower.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,If you think 50 is a little too fast (what blade?)
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,then 45 should be a step in the direction you want to go.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"Of course, I've never tried either rubber, but they're probably similar to dozens of others from the same manufacturer and in the same hardness range."

5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,I find in general that soft rubbers have less control.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"Bouncier on low impact, less power on high."
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,Less linear.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"I tried and use rhyzer 43 max, rhyzer 48 max and pro 50 2.0."
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"I never tried pro 45 because someone knowledgeable told me pro 45 is between rhyzer 48 and pro 50, not sure if it is true."
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"I also find pro 50 bit hard and fast, but when boosted it plays better for me on a slower blade."
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"Boosting softens it up and faster, and they last a very long time."
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,generally I would agree with you e.g.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,"Xiom Euro and Asia Df, and worst of all Rhyzer 43."
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,Then I found Rasanter R42 in 2mm which is linear and not bouncy at all.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,Slow when you push but fast when you hit with huge control on all shots - feels firmer than 42° would suggest perhaps the top sheet is medium hard.
5,5f6c2223035f29fdaf67ffc6,Joola Rhyzer Pro 45 vs 50. Review anyone?,Easily the best Intermediate player rubber i have used.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Where can you buy the soft skyline?
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Is this the wu yang version?
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Skyline 2 neo has a harder sponge like H3 neo and a very tacky top sheet.Skyline 3-60 mid hard (37-38 degrees) has a softer sponge (like Tin Arc) but the same top sheet although some says the top sheet is less tacky than skyline 2 neo.Skyline 3-60 soft (34-35 degrees) has even softer sponge than Skyline 3-60 mid hard but the same top sheet
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Do you know how the 3-60 soft and mid hard plays compared to the 2 neo?
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",With skyline 2 neo you have to play with proper technique.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Blocking becomes difficult if not boosted properly.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Due to the tackiness you cant play with european counter style.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",You have to provide a little top spin like action to get the ball through.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Due to the high throw close to table flips and counter top spins away from the table is superb.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",But remember all these depends on your technique.3-60 soft and mid-hard does not have much difference except for the hardness of the sponge.The softer the sponge the more the ball digs deeper and expect more catapult effect due to the neo sponge.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",But if you have used DHS National or Tenergy rubbers don't expect these commercial DHS Neo sponge to be as good as them.3-60 soft and mid-hard will help you to lift the ball easily and spin quite a bit but remember the tackiness it will grab the ball and hence you have to open the face of the blade little more and give extra power.Hope this helps.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",The opinions might differ from person to person.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",I find the TG2 Neo a much better spin+speed rubber compared to TG3-60 Mid-hard.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",TG2Neo is definitely on a lot harder sponge than TG3-60 and much more tacky topsheet.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",TG2Neo is for the loop/loop-drive player.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",It plays well either boosted or unboosted.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",And works fine with plastic ball.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",TG2Neo is not very forgiving so having proper stroke and game is important.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Skyline TG3-60 Mid-hard is like a softer version of Skyline TG2 Neo.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","Same tacky, bit faster than TG2Neo."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Skyline TG3 Neo is NON-TACKY.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",But it has tons of control.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Plenty of Euro-rubber Grippy surface.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Boosting is simple.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Precautions while boosting: 1.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Some rubbers react adversely to boosting.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Watch out and test on a cut off piece before boosting.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",2.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Some rubbers NEED a very thin layer of water-based rubber glue BEFORE you start applying the many layers of booster.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Apply evenly from the sponge center spreading evenly outwards with the applicator brush given until you have a thin even film of the oily booster glue-like substance.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Best effect if you can apply the booster and press the rubber in-between a glass plate.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",2 - 3 layers should do for most rubbers.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","From what I've seen stuff like Donic Bluefire doesn't boost easily, you end up with a taco and topsheet either separates and comes apart or you end up with bubbles where the pips got unglued and now you have giant or tiny bubbles on the topsheet."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",So have to be extra careful.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Tenergy becomes unplayable like a trampoline on drugs after more than 2 layers.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Glass-plate drying is the best effect for boosting.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Sealing boosted rubbers in Zip-Loc bags helps keep the booster in while letting the rubber calm down after several heavy layers of boosting.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",I get the best feeling after 1 or 2 weeks of not disturbing the rubber.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Immediately glueing boosted rubbers tends to feel uncontrollable and weird to play.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",But TG2 is a very slow rubber and meant for boosting.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",After 6 months it was too slow and so I boosted the TG2 and got it almost as fast as a H3 Neo sheet.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",But I felt at the time that unboosted TG2Neo is faster than H3Neo but I dont know why I had that impression.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","Skyline TG3-60 is like a softer and a little bit faster than TG2Neo so I would first get TG2 original, play with that, boost that, play some more, then once TG2 is gone, buy TG2Neo play more, boost, play and then finally buy TG3-60 and don't worry with boosting it, play lots and lots, finally when its dying boost the crap out of it, the effect doesn't last more than 1 month on the TG3-60 is what I feel."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Boosting TG2 series of rubbers is a hassle.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","Boost to minimize having to buy new rubbers, play loads more with all the rubbers until you have your techniques grooved into you."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",After than I dont think it will matter what rubber you choose as it will be mostly a personal choice / feel / preference.I haven't reached any level of consistency yet.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","Try to see how much tacky the rubber is afterwards  When you take off the stuck on non-tacky rubber protector sheet, your topsheet should look almost shiny, very uniform and if there are no watermarks it is likely that the topsheet has gained some tackiness."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Reason I am asking is becos for some reason I clean my rubbers this way and seal them.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",Almost always the tacky rubber gets back the tack!
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",After play I repeat and I don't notice any decrease in tackiness.Most of the guys whom I have built their rackets also follow the same maintenance and their MarkV rubbers are still almost brand-new even after 2 years of continuous play everyday.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",The only damage on their rubbers is where they hit the rubber on the table.

7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","Did the OP ever get a chance to try these rubbers yet (TG2 Neo and S3-60)?I use both, TG2 Neo on FH and S3-60 in the BH and I am really enjoying them!The characteristics between them are quite different, so I think they specifically serve better as FH (TG2) and BH (3-60) rubbers for my game."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo","-S-360 has a much higher trajectory/throw than TG2 Neo, and I’m assuming it’s from the extra grab when the ball sinks into the softer sponge."
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",-The tackiness of TG2 Neo is a bit more.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",-Blocking on the S3-60 is a bit more lively.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",You can’t be as passive with the TG2Neo.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",-Flat hitting is a bit more possible on the 3-60 compared to TG2.
7,5f6c267e6d99ef02106d7253,"Skyline 3-60 soft, mid-hard vs skyline 2 neo",-lower % shots s3-60 is a bit faster but has a lower ceiling before bottoming out compared to TG2 Neo.

9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I've tried MX-P and I've tried Rakza 7 (and Rakza X).
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I didn't think any of them were too fast or too slow.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,But then I don't use a Viscaria.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Iskandar
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"Below is the list of Tibhar Rubbers branded as Aurus:Aurus PrimeAurus SoftAurus Sound <--- I have used this rubber before and it is very very soft, high spin, high speed ( vs Rakza7 )Aurus SelectRakza 7 is a mid-hard Yasaka Rubber that is ESN made ( Tensor ) with high control + high spin + medium speed."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Rakza 7 Soft is the softer sponge version of Rakza7 and is noticeably slower but with even better control than Rakza7.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Aurus Sound is softer than Rakza7Soft but has slightly higher spin and speed ... but it is possible that control is degraded on Aurus Sound when compared to Rakza7Soft but feel Aurus Sound is better for better players but not for beginners.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"Hi vishal,I don't play with inverted anymore, but when I did, I have used Rakza 7 Soft, Rakza 7, Aurus Sound, and Aurus (briefly).From what I remember, both are in the same vein and there is nothing you can do with 1 that you can't do with the other.For minor differences, the topsheet of Rakza is harder and grippier than Aurus, while the Aurus sponge is harder."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Rakza has more spin while the Aurus is faster.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"But the differences are not night and day.About the soft versions, I agree with man_iii that the Aurus Sound sponge is very very soft."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,But I find the Rakza 7 Soft to be the faster and grippier of the 2.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"In fact, I would say the Rakza 7 Soft is faster than the regular Rakza 7 (on the low-mid impact range)."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Maybe the Aurus Soft (not Sound) would be comparable to Rakza 7 Soft.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,what is the purposes of using soft and very soft rubbers [less than or around 40 degree of ESN hardness ]....can these kind of rubbers be a very good combo for bh/fh if i paste this on viscaria [which i think is a OFF+ and quite hard blade as per my experience] since spin is great from these rubbers and on the other hand speed of the blade is great.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Soft rubbers tend have good feel on the ball since they are soft and the ball will sink into the rubber a lot.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I use soft rubbers because most of the time soft rubbers are very lightweight.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I have seen some modern-defenders using soft rubber due to ability to chop-block and FH chop combined with ability to topspin and surprise attack.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Also the soft rubber is very good for cut-serve or heavy-spin serves and returns that the opponent is not normally expecting.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,Depends on your game a lot.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,One of my colleagues uses H3Neo for SMASHING heavy-underspin... which a lot of people will say it is not possible....   ... but for him it works ...
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I just re-read your post.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"If you are fine with the hardness of MXP and MXS and want something slower, go with the Rakza (not soft)."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"Not to pick a fight, but (to me) harder rubbers have better feel."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"More direct, linear feel, predictable, faster on the high end but less bouncy on low impact, better control."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"yes i can control/vary my stokes to handle the speed which comes from the hardness of the rubber but i want to avoid bounciness of the rubbers[like mxp] which is unpredictable..i can understand that aurus and rakza both are medium-hard rubbers and speed [both are not bouncy] is almost same, which will be good for me.But among the two which one is better in following things  1) generating more spin,  2) lifting the underspin, 3) feel and control of the ball."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,4) durability.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,5) smashing/flat hit [which i suppose in turn depends upon the grip of the topsheet]
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"generating more spin - Rakzalifting the underspin - Rakzafeel and control of the ball - Subjective, Aurus feels more ""direct"" which to me = control, but also faster, which = less control to others.durability - Rakzasmashing/flat hit - Aurus"
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,thanks for such a crisp feedback  anybody else would like to share his/her experience?thanks in advance.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I would agree.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,For me more speed means a loss of control.
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,I guess you wouldn't want MY feedback..
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"In short, they ALL work, more or less..."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"The Rakza 7 felt slightly softer than the MX-P, but for me the difference was subtle."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"(Also, I didn't exactly test them back-to-back - the Rakza 7 went on about a year after the MX-P came off)."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"Pushing was OK, topspin drives were OK, loops were OK, blocks were OK, lobs were OK, player wasn't that OK..  - maybe it was the blade I use (blades seem to make so much more of a difference than rubbers do), or maybe I'm just not very sensitive about rubbers."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"On the bright side, that means I don't have to spend much money buying rubbers, on the flip side it makes ""reviews"" very boring because I can't think of anything interesting to write."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"I got the MX-P because I wanted to see what a super duper fast rubber was like - maybe it was like they say on the packet, it's too fast and uncontrollable unless you're a pro."
9,5f6c26a56d99ef02106d7266,aurus vs rakza 7,"Horsefeathers…  It might be if you're using a fast carbon blade, but definitely not if you have a ALL+ wood blade."

10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I am interested in the Spin version too.If u play the rubber the first day when they are new they are so tacky.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I love it!

10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,How can you bring the tack back?I had a tip from Jim Weiland....
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"When I was playing last (around 1998-2001 or so) fingerprints were BAD - people said to avoid touching the rubber, because the oils your fingers left behind would hurt the surface of the rubber."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,So part of rubber maintenance was to use dishwashing detergent to remove the oils.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Now, the consensus seems to be the opposite - some people actually wipe oil ON the rubber (or the sponge) to soften it or to ""boost"" it."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Fingerprints are actually GOOD, and dishwashing detergent is BAD."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Go figure..
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"In any case.. the trick, apparently, is to get some of those sticky rubber protector sheets."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,These are supposedly ONLY to be used with non-tacky rubbers.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"If you use them with tacky rubbers (mainly Chinese rubbers), they leave some of their glue behind and make the sheet really, really tacky."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"(This, by the way, is how I think tacky sheets are made tacky - they apply glue to it, and the glue rubs off, which is why the tackiness goes away!)"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Never actually tried it myself, except - well, I bought some shelf paper."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"This was Made in China shelf paper, with a sticky side."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I thought I'd try this as a tacky protector sheet.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,The rubber?
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Well, Yasaka ZAP (made by Palio and sold by Eacheng) is SUPPOSED to be non-tacky, right?????"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"The result is... well, that's what the video was."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I had great fun with this (see the comments section - someone asked what rubber it was.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Hurricane 4, of course....  )."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Yikes!
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Recently i used lemon oil on a red h3 original topsheet and it became faster ... not much difference in tackiness.Not sure why it dint become super tacky, maybe becos lemon oil either penetrates too fast or evaporates in seconds?"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,The two Bloom sheets arrived.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,It'll probably be a while before I take them out of the packets but it's worth mentioning the packets!Are we SURE these are 729 rubbers????
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,They're VACUUM PACKED!
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Like Yinhe used to do with Mercury II.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,729 NEVER used to sell rubber packed like this.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Ironically Mercury II is now sold in a foldover cellophane bag with a sticky strip - the sort of packaging used for, say, Batwings and Reactor Corbor."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"And, how does the spin version play?"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Did you like it?
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Is it a lot slower than the power and is the spin almost double?
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,The new Batlle II bluesponge is also vacuum packed....Greetings
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,They will remain in their packets for a few weeks yet..
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I still have to use up my AK47 Blue and Rakza 7 before I try them.Go order a sheet - I think you can still get them for $11-12 including shipping.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov, I want the opinion of another EJ.......  Maybe I'll try the spin version.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I think you can chop well with it.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Only problem is they are not allowed yet I think.Greeting!
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Unfortunately, I'm a big disappointment as an EJ..  To me most rubbers just work the same."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"For the life of me I can't figure out what to write about them, they all loop OK, they push OK, they serve OK, they produce spin OK, and I play just the same with pretty much any of them (and only get dissatisfied with them when they get old and lose their grip)."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Other than outliers like Ckylin, H3 and 999... or long/short pips.."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Spin and Power ARE in the LARC, so they should be allowed."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Don't know what the plans are for the other ones.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Kind of the opposite of Butterfly, don't you think.. in the LARC there's Butterfly stuff that hasn't been released yet - Tenergy 05N, Tenergy 09C, Dignics 05, etc."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,while 729 releases rubber that's not in the LARC yet.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Oops..
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"I just checked... You're too late, the price has gone up to about $20 across the board (and only the Eachengs have them)."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"The cheapest price is here:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2018-NE ... 20723.html$18.59 a sheet for the next 3 days...  Haven't checked ebay yet, it's worth checking because Eacheng runs two accounts there and prices are sometime lower than on AliExpress."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Hahaha, WTF  3 days ago they where half the price........  Why?"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Keep watching...
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"It'll probably drop again...  Chinese New Year is coming, incidentally.. prices may or may not drop because of it, but it would probably be best to avoid buying around that time.. unless you don't mind waiting a long time for it to arrive.."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I'll have to say.. nothing like a sudden price increase to make you realize that you really DID want something after all ...  Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I see $10.76/piece for the next 3 days: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2018-NE ... 79765.html
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Yup..
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I thought that'd happen.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Better order quick before it goes up again.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Just be aware that Chinese New Year is around the corner (5-6 February), the whole country shuts down for a couple weeks... order NOW and you might get away with it."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Happy year of the hog...  Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Ordered one spin version.......
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"I got sheets of Spin and Arc the last time they were on offer - $11 a sheet, shipped."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Crazy prices.They're great rubbers as well.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Tacky, good sponge, excellent spin."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Arc's topsheet has the most amazingly short pips - they're almost invisible.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Never seen anything quite like it before.They don't have the ITTF stamp on them though, which probably explains the low prices."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Which means I can't really commit to using them full time.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"No, that doesn't explain the cheap prices."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Normally these are $18-20, and they're that price on the other Eacheng stores."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Yeah, the same company sells the same rubber for different prices... and the prices keep changing!"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,I think I'll repeat last year's experiment - order some rubbers and blades right before Chinese New Year and see how long it takes them to arrive.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Surprisingly, last year it only took two weeks!"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"I think I'll order another 2 or 3 M-8s, (they're down to $6.50 each now, and less than $6 if you buy two or more...), a sheet of 863OX (don't ask..  ) and a sheet of 802-40OX."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Two different vendors (XVT for the blades and Eacheng stores for the rubbers).
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,My spin sheet arrived yesterday.I'll glue it this afternoon and play with it tonight.I hope I can give a lot of backspin with it when i push and chop.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,If I also can attack with it ill be happy.Greetings......
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Is that M-8 so good?I think its a little slow or not?
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"It is slower than a N11 (which is why I went to it) or, say, a Yinhe Kiso 7."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"I don't think it's any slower than, say, a Stiga Allround Classic."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"The fact that you can get one for $6.50 including shipping ($5.85 each if you buy two or more  ) is a really, really nice bonus."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"I ordered one two years ago because the picture and the price caught my eye, I play with one (actually, more like four) today because I tried playing with it and really liked it."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Then again I'm not one of those people who stand 7 feet back from the table and whale away at the ball...
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Nuts... no one sells 802-40 OX..  And the rubbers and blades I ordered over the weekend are ""awaiting shipment"" (which is what I expected, Year of the Hog and all..  )."
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Iskandar
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Played 2 training sessions with the Bloom spin version.It played very different than the Power version.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Obvious less speed therefor more control.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,The rubber makes an old glue clicking sound when I block a hard topspin or hit hard myself.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,My training partner thought there was something wrong.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Also the arc is a little strange when i blocked the ball.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,It goes a little up and then fast down.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,It's very easy to block tho but with a strange curve I've never seen before.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,Maybe a little spin sensitive??

10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,!Hope it stays good the next few weeks.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,The power version was great the first weeks but became less the more I played with it.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,All parameters as expected only the blocking part is a little strange.
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Maybe because the rubber is new.Greetings,Gido"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Thanks Gido,So did it stay good and for how long?"
10,5f6c26db6d99ef02106d7286,729 Bloom Power vs 729 Battle II vs H3 blue sponge prov,"Jip, actually I play every week with it for the last 3 months or so."
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,I know T05 and MXP very well.
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,"I can pick up one paddle with Tenergy, then switch to the MXP and not change a thing."
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,Some say T05 has more spin - I personally don't feel that it does.
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,I do think MXP is faster...
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,"It's probably T80 fast, maybe even T64 fast and this gives it a slighly flatter arc.There are other rubbers you should consider."
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,"In Japan rubbers such as Fastarc G-1 and Victas V>15 are widely used, maybe even more so than the Tenergy."
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,"I've been using V>15 for 2 or 3 months and I can attest that it has similar spin, speed, arc, etc etc."
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,It doesn't feel 100% the same but it's so close that I don't have to adjust my strokes when I play it.
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,Never played R47 but played against it once.
11,5f6c26f96d99ef02106d7298,Razanter R47 vs Evo MX-P vs T05,I thought it was pretty spinny but nothing outrageous.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"I bought a sheet to try and would say this, in play the rubber is quite good and like it was posted above pretty comparable to H3."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,But what made me go back to the h3 was spin on serve.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I couldn’t get enough with the Burst.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Just to complete the Burst review.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Played yesterday against partners and my previous comments stand.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"From the partners' perspective, there was little difference between H3 and Burst/Thor in terms of spin and the famous dip after bounce."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I did intentionally close my blade a bit more with the Burst to offset the higher arc but that was the only modification made.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Blocks against power loops and slow topspins were about equal.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,There was one difference re: previous post on serve.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,The Burst/Thor was as spinny--if not more--than the H3.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"My serves, however, are graze-thin and, when effective, both rubbers were dangerous on the serve."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Considering the higher tackiness on the Burst, this may not be altogether surprising.Conclusion: this is a great H3 alternative."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Since the USD price is only $4.50 between them, any preference would be justified by the push/flick difference in your play with the proviso that going from H3 to Burst will require a slight close on blade angle (or more forward stroke)."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks for the review Epictetus!
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,One question for you: what about the weight?
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Burst with Thor's sponge vs H3 neo?
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I looked for something slightly more dynamic than H3Neo and tested the Nittaku H3 Pro Turbo and that rubber was SOOO heavy.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks !
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,..
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Funny, I am using Burst Thors Hammer and H3 Neo on 2 defplays.The Burst was really good, but the throw angle was higher, particularly on drives and blocks."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"On pushes the high throw was problematic at first, but in the opposite direction because it's a push, your pushes go into the net."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"After some adjustment time, this is manageable, but your room for error is less."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"The Speed is far more on the Burst, so less effort for loops, blocks with more speed, but more care needs to be taken on pushes and chops."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"The H3 is definitely spinnier on just about everything, particularly on serves, and even more so on short serves.Both chop well, I prefer the H3 because of the lower throw."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"If it weren't for the difference on service, I'd likely prefer the Burst as it's more Euro feeling with the Thor's Hammer sponge.The H3 is tackier, even though it is older and more used than the Burst."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,We'll see if the Burst increases in tack...the H3 did.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Great info...
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks!What about weight difference between both?
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"I didn't weigh them on a scale, but the Burst with Thors is definitely lighter."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I'd say quite a bit lighter.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Good rubber, great value."
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Awesome.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks!
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I saw that Gambler recently released the Burst with the Gearz sponge.
12,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Anyone know what this sponge is like compared to the Thor's?

14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Thanks for the review BrummyRob!
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Comparisons to another rubber are always the most useful!
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I would also be interested in hearing from anyone who can get around the restrictions without having to physically buy them in either Japan or possibly Malaysia / Singapore.I was recently over in China and on my way pack via Hong Kong picked up a DHS Skyline 2 Neo for around €12.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Put it on a backup blade (IF ZLC) and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was and compared to the max Tenergy 05.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Skyline 2 neo gave a great sound when you hit with it.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Still missed the pronounced arch I get off the Tenergy but it was nice having a play with something different.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Cut weight was 47 grams and that was the neo.I've been buying my Tenegies from ta-q for around €38-€39 so it was a no brainer compared with the €33-€40 I was paying for Tibhar / Donic rubbers.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I did put an order in with tt-japan on the 30th of April for a load of butterfly stuff and was disappointed to discover than the order was cancelled on the 3rd of May.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I'm in the dilemma of not wanting to pay €60 for a sheet of Tenergy I will be seriously re-visiting other rubbers that will be costing less than €40.Checking tt-tapan they have the G1 for less than €32 (on the basis of not being caught for import duties) .
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I'm also going to be looking at the DHS Tin Arc 3 and will have accept that the most I will get on a replacement for a T05 is 80-90% of what I currently get.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Import duties will always be a risk, although some are willing to mark them with low values, which probably improves your chances of getting it through.€60 for Tenergy is certainly a little steep!"
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,To-date I've been using couriers from ta-q and I've been OK.  My team mate using standard post with tt-japan got caught and had to pay the duties otherwise they wouldn't realise the goods - customs didn't believe the low values.Inters pl are now charging €60 and teesport UK are charging €50 which converts into €61 at current exchange rates.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Local supplier in Dublin does them for around €58 when he has stock of them but says that he makes very little on them.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,If anyone else knows where I can get them any cheaper I would be very appreciative if they could share.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,My thoughts are that when the new poly comes official - reckon it may not be until 2015 - I will probably look at tacky rubbers for the FH so it will be a shift away from T05.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Update on Fastarc Price:Table Tennis 11 do Nittaku Fastarc G-1 for about £31 per sheet, which is the cheapest I can find so far."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,You need to buy 2 sheets then there's no shipping charge.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,From where I'm based I'm getting a price of €47.90 for the Fastarc G-1 but there is a €10 discount coupon which would easily cover the post for orders over a certain amount (I think it's €50).
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,http://www.tabletennis11.com/other_eng/ ... 20o84ZwbZ4Maybe it's appearing as a special on your access ?
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Yeah, that's weird!I just went back in to check the prices and it shows as 39.92 euros per sheet.Anyway an update on the G-1 as I played last night with it:Really getting to grips with it now and you definitely feel the ball more when you hit it compared with the Tenergy 05."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"For me this has meant that I'm getting better timing when I make my loops and topspins, and they are much more consistent, and still just as spinney as the T05."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"in fact I had a great night playing with it and my shots felt just as fast but more controlled and better than in a long while by the end of the evening.I do like the Tenergy and its a great rubber, but I think I am playing better with the G-1 so I've decided to put this on my new blade (Nittaku violin) and see what the combination is like (I'll come back on that).So a thumbs up for the Fastarc G-1 and I'm going to go with this over the T05."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Hi Multispoke,You're right."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Tax gets added on a little later when you put the shipping address in so it bumps the price up to 47.9 euros per sheet, but take off the 10 euro coupon and we get £70 for the G-1 setup vs £100 for T05."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I'll still go with that
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,Great review and comparison BrummyRob!
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I agree with all of your findings.I have also recently switched to G1 on the forehand.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"The G1 is very controllable with the harder sponge, very spinny loops (once you adjust to harder sponge) and serves, plenty of power on tap as well."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"A very predictable rubber with no quirks as far as I can tell.I find T05 to be a very one dimensional rubber, G1 is easier to produce pure side spin shots, chop, and receive service.The sheets I received were old-ish stock and the factory tuning wore off pretty quick."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,They felt quite dull and lifeless after this.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"I reboosted with Falco Long and they came up a treat, play beautifully."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Glue removal is easy too, tough sponge."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Weight of a sheet in Max is approx 48g on a standard sized blade, so same weight as T05."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"G1 has a very durable top sheet.I have been trying it on the backhand recently, liking it there as well."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Has great feel, arc and ball placement.Two thunbs up from me"
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Since some are already liking the G1, I guess the natural next step is to try out the C1 I have been using the C1 and G1 for about 1 year, but currently not using tensor for the forehand - using natural Chinese rubbers."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,These Nittaku tensor rubber models are suitable for the forehand and backhand.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"The S1 seems ok too, have this set up for the backhand of an up coming racket."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Can you say more about C-1, maybe also in comparison to G-1 and T05?"
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"I have played S-1 and I do like but I am thinking the C-1 might be the better choice for me,"
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,C1's sponge hardness sits in between that of G1 and S1.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,It feels more controllable for slower loops than G1.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,It is fast but it can't match that of G1 when you drive it hard.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I find both rubbers to be very consistent.I find G1 to be the better choice for the forehand and conversely C1 for the backhand.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I see these two as complimentary of each other.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"As well, I find C1 to be quite good for backhand pushes.I have limited experience with Tenergy, but for what I have experienced, I find it is easier to produce spin and speed with Tenergy - this is not at all to downplay the Nittaku Fastarc series at all."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,I have played couple of times with G1 and I agree with findings above.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,G1 might be the most controlled FH rubber I have tried - the high arc net clearance with slower speed + great grip + dwell + spin/speed ratio lands more shots than ever.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Shots and serves are also very precise, thanks to the grip and hard sponge."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"And when you stard pounding, there is also good speed.In the last tournament I played With Joola Rhyzm and I won both under 2200 and under 1950, so games went great."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"Rhyzm is very dynamic and bouncy, so in chopping and fishing it's quite wild to use."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"And when opponent stard really pounding to my FH, my FH defence is clearly the weakest part of my play."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,With Rhyzm defence is often all over the place.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"So, that's the part of my game I hope improve most and I hope that G1 is solution."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"The Rhyzm gives best possible ""juice"" and sidespin in fishing defence, but on the other hand control is lacking."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"I have been trying to solve my FH defence problem with slower blades, but with no success."
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,With slower blade BH Dtecs becomes too toothless and the control of FH has not been that much better.With G1 I feel really good confidence in my FH in alla kind of shots.
14,5f6c27206d99ef02106d72b0,Tenergy 05 vs Nittaku Fastarc G-1,"In the saturday is 2. division tournament with lot of matches, so the real test is coming soon.PS: If you are planning to do your looping record against block or pips block, G1 is the rubber to use!"
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,There's Apollo 5 now???
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I thought it only went up to 3.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,Have to go check.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I always thought Big Dipper was non-tacky - doesn't even have a sticky-carrier sheet.Don't see Apollo 5 at Eacheng... Iskandar
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,If it ever gets to Apollo XIII it will be a disaster.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Has anyone tried Apollo 5 yet?And yes, Big Dipper is tacky."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I remember reading a review of Apollo 5 on the MyTT forum which is part of a larger review...http://mytabletennis.net/forum/forum_po ... re#1022077Hope that helps
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Thanks, I've already read that thread.What was said about Apollo 5 in the review is more or less applicable to all hybrid rubbers, I think."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Similarly to the OP, I'm more looking for a comparison between BD and A5: both are tacky hybrids with similar sponge hardness options available, so it'd be interesting to learn about the differences between them."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Last time I checked with Yinhe, they said they were no longer making the Big Dipper."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"This would not surprise me, as they have a habit of discontinuing old rubbers and coming up with new ones instead."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Probably new ones sell better, because people will always want to buy the latest."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"They do the same with their blades.The problem is that if you find something you like, you might not be able to get it next time... not good for the customers..."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I'm pretty sure the sheet of Big Dipper I got wasn't.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"It didn't even have the plastic ""protector sheet"" that you have to pull off tacky sheets."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,The packaging is also totally unlike the usual Yinhe vacuum pack.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,So much for God's Crossbow Sponge..  Haven't checked out Yinhe in a LONG while.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Do what I do - if you like a blade, get 3 or 4 weight matched ones."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,Just in case... Iskandar
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,Just had a quick peek on AliExpress.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Apollo II (the non-tacky one) is still there, Apollo III is NOT (very interesting!)"
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,and Apollo V isn't either.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Apollo II and III shared the same topsheet, wonder if Apollo V does as well."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Since there's only one entry for Apollo in the LARC (49-001), it must."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Big Dipper, in several variants of sponge hardness, is still available."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"There are three new rubbers - 49-005 ""Max Tense M. Star"", 49-006 ""Max Tense E. Moon"" and 49-022 ""Max Tense Venus""."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,This is interesting because 1) Big Dipper is 49-007.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,Did Max Tense M. Star and Max Tense E. Moon replace earlier rubbers numbered 49-005 and 49-006?????
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"There is also an unnumbered rubber called ""Venus"" (sold as Venus II recently and not being sold by Eacheng any more on AliExpress)."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"DHS is having a renumbering exercise, replacing old, unnumbered rubbers with numbered versions with the same name (e.g."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"666 with 24-016 G666), maybe Yinhe is doing theirs, too, slowly."

15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,Apollo V was released in 2018.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"From what I have read myself, this is the new version of the rubber and has retained the same LARC number as the previous Apollo rubbers?http://mytabletennis.net/forum/forum_po ... re#1022077"
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"Oh, thanks, that's good to know."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I guess I'd better not get used to BD as my primary FH rubber then.Mine was pretty tacky (was able to hold the ball for ~10 sec) and had plastic sheets on both the topsheet and the sponge.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I don't remember if the packaging was vacuum-sealed but the rubber's smell was... let's say intensive and it kept like that for good two weeks.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"While I realize that you joined the board well after I made my post, that has to be one of the longer penny drops for one of my quips"
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,That what I get for not checking the date of the post  .
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"I was viewing it on my cell phone, noticed this thread near the top of the inverted rubbers forum and didn't realize it was an old thread with a few recent comments."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,I just realized this isn't that clear.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,"The new ""Max Tense"" rubbers aren't on AliExpress, they're new entries in the LARC."
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,In which case it uses the same topsheet.
15,5f6c27216d99ef02106d72b1,Big Dipper vs Apollo 5,Iskandar
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,I'm interested in this too.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Alex's store doesn't seem to have an option to select sponge hardness, so I thought it may be random / unmarked or something."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I was also looking at 29 Battle II as it's supposed to be just as good, just a little harder and more chinese."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I've read on other forums that 40 deg Big Dipper doesn't play too well, too much ball slippage."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I'd be willing to believe that, because Big Dipper uses the soft topsheet plus tackiness to spin the ball, instead of 'grab' from the pimple structure that a lot of European or Japanese rubbers use."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,I've played with Big Dipper 38 on a few different blades.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"It's great on my Avalox Ruiba, which is mediumish speed and fairly stiff / linear (no real spring)."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"As you said, the sponge gets really soft after it breaks in."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Still has heaps of speed, but the throw is a bit more dynamic than I would like."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,Drives are a lot lower than brushes.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,It gets more dynamic as the sheet gets older.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,It's also pretty good on my KTL black coffee.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Because the blade is fast and springy, the sponge of the big dipper actually feels harder."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"The ball doesn't penetrate as much, as the blade has a slight deform."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"At least that's what it feels like, what's actually happening may be different."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,As a result the throw angle is less dynamic and slightly higher in general.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"If you don't like the harder versions of Big Dipper, consider trying it on a different blade, it may make a difference.I've also tried in on my Galaxy W-1."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,Doesn't work.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,It's really slow and dead.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,I think Big Dipper requires harder blades.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,I'm using Big Dipper on a Dr N Magical Touch blade.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I like the feeling (especially before the rubber broke in), and my SP on the BH side also feels good, which is not always the case, as I learned recently - FH rubber impacts the BH feeling a lot.As you said, Big Dipper became more soft and dynamic, and I've only been playing with it for a couple of weeks."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Will it keep getting softer and softer?Cole is saying he's got all three versions of Big Dipper: 38, 39, and 40."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I'd like to try Battle II, too, but it seems to be hard to get it here in the US."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"It probably won't get much softer, assuming you've put 10 or more hours into it, and you've engaged the sponge a lot in that time."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"If you're getting it from Cole, you can specify the sponge hardness, which is great."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"After it has broken in, it does last quite a long time."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"You don't notice the drop off in performance, it happens slowly over a long period of time."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,Played them both.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,Right now i'm playing 729 bloom power.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,I think it is better than big dipper or 729 battle 2.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,Bloom power is softer and faster than Battle 2 and grippier than Big Dipper IMHO.Played them all in red.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Oh, thanks for mentioning, I learned about the Bloom series just now."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Although there are 5 rubbers in it, only two seem to be certified with ITTF.Why did you choose Bloom Power over Spin?"
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Do I understand correctly that it isn't a hybrid rubber, i.e."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"doesn't have a ""tensor"" sponge?"
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,Did you boost it?
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I played with Big Dipper for a while, and didn't notice anything about it getting softer."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"I don't remember the hardness - Yinhe has, in the past, gone from stating degrees to simply marking the rubbers Hard, Medium, etc."
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,and maybe they've moved back again.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"It's not expensive, between $15 and $20 a sheet if you search on AliExpress, so why not try different hardnesses?"
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,You'd probably feel a difference between 38 and 40 but 39 would be pretty close to either one of the other two and you'd have to really concentrate to feel any difference I think.
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Then again I had Rasant on another identical blade and I couldn't tell much difference between Rasant and Big Dipper, either, playing them back to back...  Iskandar"
16,5f6c27256d99ef02106d72b3,Big Dipper 38 deg vs 39 vs 40,"Well, I'd definitely be able to tell the price difference"
17,5f6c272c6d99ef02106d72b9,Rasanter R37 vs Fastarc S-1,Why these two in particular?

19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,To be honest.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,What is your budget?
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"I like the MX-P over T64, it has been a while since I have used the T64."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,I don't think that there is that much of a difference to warrant the price tag of the T64 over the MX-P.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,I am more then happy with the MX-P I have on my blade at the moment.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Im my experience with both, mx-p its more similar to T05, t64 have a very soft topsheet and a hard sponge resulting in a soft felling overall, and mxp have a hard topsheet and a harder sponge."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"what the man said...mxp is harder sponge rubber, more similar to t05...if you are searching for a t64 substitute try softer evolution series...http://blog.tabletennis11.com/tibhar-ev ... ers-reviewviewtopic.php?t=29744"
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,My budget is 100$+ and i think that would be enough.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,So like your set up right now is that good as an alternative for the tenergy rubbers?
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Personally, I think it is."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Like I mentioned before, my experience with Tenergy and the Evolution Rubbers, there is not a great deal of difference for me to spend that much more on my rubber sheets."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,You'd be better off getting the Tibhar rubbers and spending the rest of the budget on a training session with a good coach.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,I have a lot of experience with these rubbers including Tenergy 05.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,I think 05 and 64 is still one class ahead vs mx-p specially if you are using the right blade.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"However, my complaint with Tenergy is that it tends to lose its power ( or boost? )"
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,after a month of continued use.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,Aside from the price of cource.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,My current set - up Gewo Hype EL feels almost the same with MX-P.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,I will revert back to MX-P once my current rubber is worn out already.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Used to use both T64 and MXP, both on a defensive blade, BTY Joo Se Hyuk."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Overall I found T64 was considrubly faster, but weaker on the spin side."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Both great rubbers, but depends on what your looking for."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"T64 to me is something else to MXP, much stronger in most aspects."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"I prefer it's balance of speed-spin, but it's your choice."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"If you like spinny, still well paced rubbers, MXP is for you."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"If your much more aggressive, needing extra power, then go for T64."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Again, both great rubbers, quite similar, so go for what you think."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Not a comparison with Tenergy but I've been playing with MX-P for the last few months - read about it here:viewtopic.php?f=44&t=25211&start=375#p339783It's getting pretty grotty, and it's shrunk yet again."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Been through about 3-4 boost cycles, and it's time for another one."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Actually, perhaps it's time to try something else, too."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Maybe it's time to find out what all the hype about Tenergy 05 is all about (boy is it expensive, though....).."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"I mean, the stuff's almost TEN YEARS OLD and it's still referred to in hushed tones, leads the pack in the number of international pros using it, AND is what everyone refers to by way of comparison."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,Maybe it'll be unusable by a lowly player like me.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Then again, maybe not...  Iskandar"
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,I have been using a red sheet of used MXP rubber that I got for free.Would have to be the fastest rubber I've ever used.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,Seems slightly faster to me than the various Tenergy rubbers.It's feels - like the sponge or rubber holds the ball for a split second before catapulting the ball super fast.
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Sort of a clicky,speed glue sound.It's also good for lifting heavy chop.I missed a lot of forehand drives with it on my first session but I'm still not quite dialled in to the angle of bat it needs.I really love the feel of this rubber like no other."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"05 feels a bit harder to me than this rubber,64 feels softer."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,"Somewhere in between perhaps.I put a lightweight Omega 7 on the other side,my backhand and my MXP played a little slower.I then put my favourite though heavier Stiga Genesis back on - and I found another gear for speed with the MXP.It's a heavy rubber so I would not use it on a blade more than 85g."
19,5f6c27486d99ef02106d72c8,Tibhar Evolution MX-P vs Butterfly Tenergy 64,My Stiga Sense 7.6 weighs 82g and my bat is now as heavy as I can handle.
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,"You need to select one of the Xiom rubbers marked ""df"" for improved grip for the Poly ball."
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,I am using Vega Asia df and it really does grip the ball well especially on serves and I much prefer it to Japan which did not suit my all-round medium pace game style.
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,Thx for anserw.
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,"You think Asia DF is it appealing to Japan when it comes to speed, controls, and hardness?"
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,"No, Asia DF is more like the old original Vega Europe in hardness and catapult, definitely softer and easier to play than Vega Japan but can be a bit bouncy in the short game."
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,"Japan needs hard strokes to get the best out of it, lacks feel and can be a bit slippy with the plastic ball.There is however two brand new Vega series rubbers DEF and TOUR both of which claim to be designed for the plastic ball."
20,5f6c276b4272aba9ab775676,Xiom Vega Japan vs Xiom Vega Tour ,It sounds like the new Vega Tour might be what you are after as t will be more like Japan in hardness in fact some initial reviews indicate it is more like a hard attacking Chinese rubber than euro.https://www.tabletennisdaily.com/equipm ... our-rubberhttps://www.tabletennisdaily.com/forum/ ... our-Review
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,People tend to obfuscate fact with their own opinions when talking about the difference between Chinese and Euro/Non-Chinese rubbers.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"From a factual perspective (at least, generally), Chinese rubbers are:  - Harder Sponged - Softer, Tackier Topsheet - Lower Quality control so bigger variance between sheetsWhere it gets mixed up is where things ""work"" for some people with one type of rubber, and not with another."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"This bleeds out, thinking one is just good for one thing or better than the other, but in reality they're just different."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"It does depend on level, with Euro style tending to work for the ""middle"" of the bell curve and Chinese for either end."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"BECAUSE of the rubber properties, you'll find new players will often say that they find chinese better for everything, and as they get better keep finding they make mistakes -try a euro and voila!"
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Miracle!
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"The main difference for you and the direct answer to part 1:  - Chinese rubbers, as they are hard but soft and sticky topsheet, Use this topsheet as the main reagent in spin creation are generally considered better for service, service return, and pushing - Euro rubbers, which are soft sponged in comparison and non-tacky, with a matt or ""grippy"" feel on the topsheet - are generally better for high spin loops, lobs, and loop drivesSmashes and ""No spin"" you might find easier with Chinese, but not necessarily more effective."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"The difference between the chinese and euro loops are technique based, rather than rubber specific."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"the chinese ""straight arm"" loop works well for chinese rubbers, because the hard sponge/tacky topsheet really needs a lot of power behind it to make the most of the shot."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"This is why you hear people talking about ""gears"" etc being more available to you with Hurricane etc."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"The loop is generally a bigger swing, with a softer ball contact, but hitting much ""harder"" to really activate the spong."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"The ""euro"" loop, due to the relationship between softer sponge and topsheet, does not need as much brute force to get maximum power."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,it's a bit more of a catapault/spring effect.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"It means you'd find soft and spinny, slow loops easier - you can still get to high power - but instead of brushing and hitting at full pace, you need to angle your bat to close the topspin."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"All in all, what you use comes to preference and what you like to do."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I personally used chinese when i was at the peak of my game.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Now I'm still training, but have gone to an almost hybrid rubber, as I tend to value my short touch game but need the ability to ""spin up"" when in Defense."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Slogans for each rubber: Chinese: You get out what you put in!
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Euro: Wow, I didn't know you could loop that?"
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Dan
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"The difference is in that one type of loop (if done properly) produces more bat speed than the other does, at the expense of longer setup and recovery times."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Also, it's not just bat angle but also the direction of bat movement, since the contact is NOT instantaneous, despite what a lot of people say."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,It takes time (if only milliseconds) for the rubber to compress and then rebound.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"If the rubber does not compress then rubber hardness is irrelevant, and we all know it is not."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Iskandar
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I'm guessing that any high level player with a Euro loop would generate a lot more bat speed than the rest of us chumps regardless of what type of loop we do.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Thats why I'm thinking style is irrelevant, its just bat speed.So are there any Chinese rubbers that are quicker out the pack than tensors, based on an intermediate swing or do you need that bat speed to get the most out of them?"
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I think that the chinese loop technique is not only a question of bat speed in the ball hitting phase.It's also a question of blade direction and lifting the ball.European style is more like lifting the ball with the bat while hitting the ball.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,You get a bit more force upwards and more curve and a slightly slower ball.Chinese style is more lifting the ball with your legs and the bat forces the ball more foreward.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,this results in a slightly flatter curve and more speed.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"You're right, then again I don't think it takes Ma Long level looping to be able to take advantage of Chinese rubbers."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,While it probably wouldn't make a difference to me there are probably lots of 2000+ rated folks on this forum who swing hard enough (or have the potential to swing it hard enough) where it might.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Iskandar
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Note I did a search as I expected the to be other similar posts but nothing came up.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Just noticed i spelt my search wrong hence now we have another one of these threads.Oh well, nothing like covering old ground."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,After all this forum survives on what bat should I buy threads.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,One main thing that Chinese sticky rubbers do well is the is the topspin counter loop which is very popular in recent years lead by Ma Long.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"With the sticky topsheet the counter loop can be done at very low height, even below table, and still have power and pace."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,You can't do that with a Euro rubber for sure.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Funny you should mention that, because as a 'long time' sticky rubber user, I always found this to be one of the hardest things to do."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Because the surface grip is so high on tacky rubbers, the balls grip so hard I always has trouble keeping it on the table.. most loops just went over the end due to the high incoming topspin."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"You need to close the bat angle so much to keep it on, that the margin for error was too high for my technique.No doubt the ball will be loaded if you do manage to counterloop."

21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Ive switched from a DHS Neo 3 to Xiom Vega Europe, recently - I don't counter loops, too often."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"However, I find myself doing it a lot more, that too with decent success, ever since I've switched to the XVE + Defplay combo.. Not sure if it's the rubber, or the blade, or a. Combo of both..I don't have a brushing action, when top-spinning, so I feel, the XVE(most Euro or Jap rubbers) is better suited to my style, compared to the NEO 3; at least on the FH."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"I find this style of rubber to be more forgiving, and requiring less effort to generate speed/power.."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Better at lifting back-spin..
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Blocking, on the other hand, I feel, was much easier/better/more effective, with the Neo 3."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Same with over-the-table pushing, and even chopping, to an extent... Flat-out hitting too was better..."

21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"@haggisv, I think you do close the bat angle a bit more compare to looping underspin and blocks but the key to me is precise, strong, explosive footwork."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Tired legs is not a good match for Chinese rubbers.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,What helps me the most to get the right feel is lots of multiballs.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"@carbonman, if you take a look at the recent match of XX vs Frankziska in the wtttc final you will see my point."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,XX is topspining the ball below the table half of the time during counter loops and killing his opponent.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,It's very difficult to finish a point below the table if you are not using a Chinese rubber.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Euro rubbers are too fast and doesn't ""hold"" the ball well to get that kind of trajectory."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,tt4u - why do you assume the telling variable to be equipment and not technique?
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,XX has a huge swing and generates enormous power whereas Franziska has a far more economical swing.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,If XX used Euro rubber and Franziska used Chinese rubber do u really think there would be any significant change?
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Look at players like Rye Seung Min and Kim Taek Soo.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,They used Euro rubbers and could loop powerfully from anywhere because they had powerful technique.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Even back in the day, players like Jonyer could hit blindingly powerful loops from low balls using Sriver."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"At a slightly lower level...If you have some strongish loopers (say above 2400) at your club get them to show you how to loop powerfully off low balls with Euro rubber, its not that difficult."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Really???
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Weren't Jonyer et al.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,doing this back in the 1970s using plain old Sriver??
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Albeit with speed glue.Huh.. just noticed that Carbonman posted the exact same thing..  Iskandar
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I've got a bye next week so will take the chance on Saturday to have have a little experiment with my rubbers.Last week at practice I used my Gewo Robles OFF- with Flexxon Soft 1.9mm.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Then I switched to Yasaka extra with Haifu whale and did instantly tell it was slower.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Not sure if more or less spinnier, though loops were hitting more the middle of the table than the end but this could also have been due to speed.This week I'm going to play with them the same for a bit then so the two rubbers to see if it makes any difference."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I'm wondering if the Robles week so be faster or even if the gap is bridged a little.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Will help me understand good things work.I wonder what I'll find.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Mount a Chinese sheet on one side and a Euro sheet on the other side.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Twiddle and try the same stroke.Iskandar
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I'd actually written about that but deleted.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,My Backhand rubber is fairly new and nicely cut so don't want to disturb it and possibly shrink.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,lol...and Jonyer and co only started using glue in the LATE 70s.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Before that the big shots were produced with just humble unassisted Sriver.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,If the backhand is a Euro rubber put a Chinese one on the forehand or vice versa..Iskandar
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I’ve seen (and heard) Surbek hit it heavy in the pre-speedglue days.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Plain ol’ Sriver, thick-sponged."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I think that sick sound is what “sound” rubbers seek to provide.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"I was not comparing players but merely ask you to see XX loops due to use of Chinese rubber, because he, and likewise a young ZJK, covers a lot of territories with their forehand."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"If XX use a Euro rubber on the same blade his percentage would be way down, which would make the rubber useless."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Given the same blade and same fitness level I still say a sticky Chinese rubber is better at loops and counter loops low balls.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,I haven't seen Jonyer in action so I can't comment.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"The curves on the loops of RSM and KTS looks very different than XX's, especially the footwork, but it's just me."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,RSM and KTS didn't looked to finish points at such low height.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,Just wondering how you know this.
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"Give Xu Xin a racket with Tenergy 05 on it, let him practice with it for a week and I'll bet he'd be looping just as well as he ever did."
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,The Chinese use H3 for the control over the table ( the short game) rather than added power in the loops.Iskandar
21,5f6c277d4272aba9ab77567f,Chinese vs Euro,"More and more I think that ""hard"" in hard sponged Traditional Chinese Rubber is a misnomer.Should be called ""damp"" instead."

22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,Back when we were using 38mm balls the usual advice was that beginners should start with 1.5mm sponge.
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,Most of the better players (the loopers anyhow) would go to 2.0mm.

22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,Enter the 40mm ball.
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,Suddenly many rubbers (ESPECIALLY cheaper Chinese beginner rubbers) are ONLY available in max sponge.
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,Beginners now actually start with max sponge.
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,"The way I see it, these days, thinner sponge is for special purposes.. choppers (though most choppers also loop a lot these days and opt for thicker sponge), pips-out blockers, balsa blades, etc."
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,"In fact, you should be able to use even thicker sponge, the current max isn't the upper limit in terms of ball control in the short game."

22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,"Using thinner sponge would help with control over the table, but if you rely on topspin drives you will lose control when the rubber bottoms out, especially if you use softer sponge."
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,"(In the old days no one ever mentioned ""bottoming out"", maybe because the ball was so much lighter."
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,")So in short - thinner rubber gives you more control for pushes, blocks over the table, chops, because it's slower (this is with inverted rubbers, I'm not going to get into sponge/no sponge when it comes to long pips, which I know nothing about)."
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,"At the same time, you can't generate as much spin with thinner sponge unless you're doing brush shots."
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,"This hurts when topspin driving - you won't be able to loop the ball as hard because you get less spin, and it's the spin that causes the ball to arc/dip and hit the table."
22,5f6c278d4272aba9ab77568a,Sponge difference 1.7 vs 1.9 vs 2.1 inverted,You also lose control sooner due to bottoming out when looping.

26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I think it depends a lot on personal preference.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"For soft and slow balls I find it easier to load up the spin with tacky rubbers, but for other parts of the game it seems just as spinny, and the non-tacky tends to be a little less sensitive to spin.If you're going to loop as well, real tacky rubbers seem not as spinny, but with mildly tacky or non-tacky I seem to be able to get plenty of spin."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Would one of the specialist Victas rubbers which is designed for chopping meet what you're looking for ?
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Agree with haggisv, it depends on personal preference."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I find chopping with tackies a lot harder compared to something like mark V or Joola Mambo.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I am considering Hurricane 3 to replace my joola rhyzm.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Also, tacky rubbers tend to be unusable when it is so humid."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Is this correct?
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,729 gets slick but 999T is pretty usable even when it's humid.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Don't have data for anything else.Iskandar
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Changing from a typical medium soft rubber to a H3 could add another 10 grams to your setup and it could make it uncomfortable to use.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,It can also result in wrist tendonitis.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,This is a really good point.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I played with a heavy double-inverted blade that I borrowed for a few days, when I stopped using OX LP on a very light blade."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"The difference in weight was significant, and I immediately started finding that my wrist hurt and I tired quickly."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Maybe that could be overcome with exercise and physio, but I consider it a risk with heavy kit."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Tacky will have a slight lag in ball take off, a hold and release feel."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,If you use tacky you get used to the timing of that little hold or grab feel.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"This also happens on serves, tacky being especially a little easier to generate low short and spinny serves (to me anyway) ."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Thank you on your insights.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I might give it a go.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,But I think I can't handle additional weight anymore.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I see the weights in your signature and smile.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I would need to use both arms to swing a 183 gram set up!
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,My current favorite is 160 g.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I have not tried weighing my primary set-up.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I am used to using heavier set-up but I'm feeling the effect in my wrist.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I think at least somewhat tacky helps with both looping and chopping, as well as serving, but requires reading incoming spin better."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I could never loop at all with the Donic rubbers because there was no tackiness to help grab the ball initially.My current setup with 0X on one side and Tacky MAX Grip-S Europe soft on the other with 1 mm edge tape and handle tape weighs in at 158 gr, which is at least 15 gr more than the same setup with 1.8 mm Rakza 7 Soft, and it is noticeable."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"It is also noticeably slower, but might ber fast enough to attack with the right strokes, and does chop well because the chops have tremendous spin."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Any kind of slow rubber is better for chopping.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,There are a number of dedicated defensive rubbers that are easier to chop.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Some of them are tacky, mild tacky or non tacky at all.Many modern Chinese style rubbers are as light or lighter then some modern Euro/Asian style rubbers."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Red Lion said in the beginning he wanted something that could chop, but not limited to chopping.What Chinese style rubbers are lighter?"
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"All the ones I've had have been very heavy.I would like to find something very spinny that has enough tackiness to help get lots of spin on serves, that is also pretty fast, but not heavy."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,If I had to describe it it would be a tackier Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft or a tackier Nittaku Narucross GS Soft.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Those both have excellent mechanical spin, and are reasonably light, but don't have a lot of tackiness to get the ball spinning fast on serves.IMO, the ""chopping"" rubbers I've tried are just too slow to hit successfully with.The Tibhar Grip-S Europe Soft is borderline speed wise."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Its quite heavy, but is at least somewhat tacky and gets great spin on serves, and after I cut down the blade to closer to normal sized yesterday, I was able to hit a bit better with it."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,It is still pretty heavy though.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I'm at 144 gr with the Grip-S, which feels quite heavy to me, and does slow me down, but was a lot easier to swing than the the 157 gr anchor it was before I trimmed down the size."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"It will be a while to adjust to it, though."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Every time I change something it takes weeks or months to adjust.I am very interested to hear of any rubbers that are very spinny, somewhat tacky, reasonably light or at least not heavy, and fast enough to hit with, but still good at chopping, Chinese or otherwise?"
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"By far the easiest to chop with inverted rubber I have ever used was this:KOKUTAKU BLütenkirsche 868(TENSION, SUPER-TACKY)."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,It is less than 12 US dollars at eacheng.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Now other strokes are a totally different story, but if I was going to play a pure chopping game this would be it."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,the sponge is hard as a rock and dead!
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"The Victas VS 401 fits this criteria, except that it's relatively heavy."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,It's tremendous for chopping though and has plenty pf speed for hitting.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I tried it in 1.8 thick red, and the VS>401 does chop very well, but yes, it was very heavy, and trying to hit with it was a failure due to both weight and speed.Since then, I got some Grip-S Europe 1.8, and it chopped very well, too, but was also to slow to hit with, so then I decided I NEEDED faster rubber, but also a lighter setup, so I got some Grip-S Europe Soft MAX, and THEN I filed down the blade to 1/2 way between its original size (was same as my 1976 Butterfly Secretin-K) and my Yasaka Extra."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Its still about 160 x 163 but that reduced the weight by 14 grams down to 144 gm with edge epoxy, edge tape, handle tape, and all, and now its just barely light enough that I can swing it faster, and am now trying to learn to hit again instead of just chopping everything under the sun."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"That also has helped my inverted chopping vs big loops because I can get more racket speed on the chops, which is needed or I pop the ball up."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"People think I'm nuts, LOL."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"You ought to try LKT XT Pro, light, tacky, very spinny, great for chopping, blocking, serves, hitting and top spinning!Oh and cheap!"
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I think tacky for backhand is a bad idea, and you can see that if not all, most Chinese Nat Team use Tenergy 05 on the BH and Tacky rubbers on the FH."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Why is this?
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"It's because to get a lot of spin, you need a fast and big swing with tacky rubbers."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,They're also much more sensitive to spin -- not good for BH.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,They also not nearly as good for blocking.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"With Tenergy, you need a mere micro wrist movement to blast the ball with loads of spin.Donic Slice 40 and Tackiness Chop 2 are quite tacky but not Chinese tacky."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Also add Tibhar Super Defense.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,The Donic was pretty light.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,I always thought the reason they used Tenergy on the backhand was because you get less power on the backhand and H3 requires a lot of power to be used properly.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I honestly can't tell between tacky and non-tacky rubber most of the time - tacky would be most Chinese rubber (including the Dragons I like to use, and what I'm playing with mostly these days which is Apollo III) and non-tacky would be Shark, Yasaka ZAP and that Tensor I bought."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Currently I'm using 9000 on my backhand, its fairly tacky."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Nothing I've come across is as tacky as 729 back in the 1980s - that stuff would pick up a ball (albeit a 38mm one) when just cleaned.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Tackiness Chop would also, though it wasn't near as tacky as 729."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Back then we thought 729 was fast (mainly because it had hard sponge) and beginners were warned it was hard to use.

26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers, Exactly how I feel.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"With a purpose, if I use a tacky rubber (999 or H3) I will remove the heavy tack and get to be only mild tack."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Gives me best of both worlds in summer.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"Not as reactive to spin, and resistant to moisture forming on topsheet."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,The easiest short explaination I can say for what defines tacky and grippy is that tacky is sticky.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,it gets its spin from a hard hit thorugh slightly off center and the stickiness combined with the bat accelleration struck just off center hit gives the heavy spin.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"On the same shot, a grippy rubber is not sticky, but the topsheets tend to be a little thinner and more elastic and on impact, the topsheet wraps the ball more to get the adhesion required and the rebound of the deformation of topsheet/sponge combined with the speed/accelleration (usually ball struck with a slightly more closed angle) gives the spin.Looking at that explaination, I can see why we would still be troubled about what is different."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,"I suppose it would be the role of how the topsheet is engaged.I usually tell people tacky rubbers are sticky and grippy ones are not sticky, but still have decent adhesion if enough of the topsheet can contact the ball."
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,Reviving this old thread.What would be better for slow spinny loops?
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,The ones that you barely touch the ball and it travels over like slow motion.
26,5f6c281f4272aba9ab7756de,Tacky inverted rubbers vs non-tacky rubbers,You know your opponent is in trouble (at my level) and sure enough the ball sails long of the block.Tacky or non-tacky?This is a shot i seem to have lost since going to Euro tensors but my stroke has also changed.

29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"As for fast/slow, that's pretty subjective, and is a function of how you play your strokes, the sponge thickness and type, the topsheet, and also the blade.On the whole, I think that many amateur players generally use equipment that is much ""faster"" than they need."

29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"I'd say this is generally a ""fast"" setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,His loops and counterloops are blistering.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"However, he can't serve short, and he can't touch short."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I'm pretty sure his serving and touching technique is good.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"When he served with my old coach's 5 ply blade, with H3N, his serves were much much better, and his short game was far more controlled."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Sure his loops weren't as ""fast"" and he needed to put in more effort, but I thought he played better with the less fast setup.I sometimes play weaker players using my hardbat setup - 2 x Dr Evil on a Tibhar Defence Plus."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Now this is probably about the slowest setup I have ever felt.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"To get the ball full length on a FH or BH drive, I need to exert much more energy than with my usual setup (1.8mm short pips on an OFF blade)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"However, within about five minutes, my brain/body has corrected its expectations, and I can play the balls short or long, with plenty of control."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"When I need to hit the ball hard and fast, I can."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If there's a weak ball and I smash it, it goes very hard and very fast."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"This is with no sponge, on one of the slowest blades on the planet."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I don't lack penetration - I just need to place the ball well and get the timing right.My team mate is a top division two player.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Probably good enough for division one.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"He has superb control on his FH and BH, and can roll and place the ball accurately."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Against even slightly high balls, his FH is explosive, yet accurate."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"He hits the ball very very hard indeed, with masses of spin, and can hit through most defenders at this level."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If you watch him playing, you might think he has a very fast setup indeed."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Nope he uses an all wood, ALL+ blade, and 2.0mm Sriver on both sides.What's my point?"
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"There's a lot of gibberish spoken about ""fast"" and ""slow""."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Clearly there are measurable and experienceable differences, but on the whole an amateur player can do pretty much anything with pretty much any setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"In general, faster setups should probably be eschewed until a player can demonstrate control and mastery of all their strokes with an allround setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I'm not sure that I do understand the question correctly.Do you ask for the advantages/disadvantages between going for faster rubbers but thinner sponges compared to softer or slower rubbers with unchanged or thicker sponge viewed from a certain starting point?
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Usually thin (sponge) means less speed, so I wonder what you're asking about."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Same with blades - thin blades are usually slower than thick ones.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Iskandar
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"IMO Speed is less of a consideration as there are a lot of slower thick blades (309 chop, defensive balsa), and plenty of of slower thick rubbers (Reflectoid, tack chop, etc)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Also plenty of fast thinner blades (Carbon) and thinner fast-ish rubbers (Yanus, thin Yasaka Mark V HPS, thin, tenergy, thin Vega Asia)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"The thicker you go with Reflectoid/P-4/Tack chop/FL3, the SLOWER and more dampening they become."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"To answer the OP's question, it's mostly about feel and preference."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Some of the thicker blades just feel different, depending on the type of material they use."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,It also causes stiffness and the amount vibes are change.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Weight could also be a difference, but that largely depends on the type of wood.Thin vs."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thick rubbers.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thickness/Thiness gives you consistency for very specific shots.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Thinness on the same rubber usually gives you less grip, and particularly for chopping it makes dealing sidespin loops more managable (this goes for both pips and inverted)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thinner rubbers are also easier to flick with because of the same spin-insensitivity.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Generally, the thinner the rubber, the more spin-insensitive it is (always comparing to the same rubber but different thicknesses).Thickness gives you conistency of throw angle when you block/drive/smash, and ensures that you rarely bottom out your rubber which will always (and suddenly) change your throw angle."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thicker rubbers also give more mechanical grip as they tend to envelop the ball and thus more surface area is in contact.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"So if you wish to generate more spin with your bat movement, thicker is generally how you do it."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"The feel is also different, so people who have styles that rely on touch and not power so much often prefer thinner rubbers for more feeling."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If you are all power all day, thicker is generally the preference."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Sorry for the vague question.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,An extreme example of what I meant would be 1.5mm Tenergy (I know this doesn't exist) vs. Mark V max.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Sponge accounts for a significant portion of the bat's weight, so I guess the thinner sponged rubber would yield a lighter setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,This would be at the expense of spin capability on high impact shots.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If you have a weak wrist and a fast loop is not in your repertoire, thin sponge on a fast rubber might be your cup of tea, if you can find it."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Most likely, you'd lose more than you gain."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"I knew exactly what you were asking, and that's what I was responding to."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I am actually looking for a fast-ish thin rubber for Classic Chopping on the FH.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I think you would have the advantages of a thinner rubber (insensitive to sidespin) but a little more speed to help get the ball back without too much forward motion.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If there is decent grip and/or tack to the topsheet, then service should be fine."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,that largely depends on the type of wood.จีคลับเข้าไม่ได้
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"And yet another alternative, thick and fast on a slower blade.In any case, to answer the actual question asked, I would argue that thicker is better for offensive minded players."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,The feel is better.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I would also suggest perhaps something a bit harder.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thick sponge is necessity for power loop with both speed and spin.Choppers prefer thinner sponge for maximum underspin.The overal rubber speed is less important.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Well, I can tell you very thick, very slow rubber is pretty disappointing."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"My first custom racket had Tackiness Chop 2.0mm on it (this was back in the day of the 38mm ball, 2.0mm was considered quite thick, beginners started with 1.5mm)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Way too slow for any kind of attacking game.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Iskandar
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,It would require very good technique.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,But i have seen people attack with it very effectively.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Honestly, you can adapt to anything."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Even I can attack with 1.0mm Reflectoid.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,That is about as non-offensive as you can get.
30,5f6c28874272aba9ab77571e,Mark V vs. Stiga Mendo,They are classic and very similar.
30,5f6c28874272aba9ab77571e,Mark V vs. Stiga Mendo,You really can't go wrong with either.
30,5f6c28874272aba9ab77571e,Mark V vs. Stiga Mendo,mark V is still a best seller for many websites.
30,5f6c28874272aba9ab77571e,Mark V vs. Stiga Mendo,"If you have been playing with Mendo, I can't see any advantage to switching to Mark V."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I've used both DHS tacky FH rubbers (Skyline 3, Hurricane 3), and European Tensors (Andro Hexer), and recently Tenergy 05."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"My observations tend to be that in practical terms Skyline/Hurricane is slower, because the rubber isn't in any way tensioned or springy, and the sponge is quite hard."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,This has the effect of allowing you to swing at the ball faster without worrying about whether the ball is going to land in the next room.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,The second observation concerns the way the rubber spins.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Hurricane/Skyline are sticky/tacky rather than grippy.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"It feels to me as if I get more spin on a serve with a DHS rubber than a Tensor, but I find spin generation on FH topspins more effortless on the Tensors.Personally, I really like using Hurricane and/or Skyline."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"It's solid, predictable, offers good control, and plenty of speed, and seems to be linear in terms of you getting out of the shot what you put in."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,It may actually do your game some good to drop back to a rubber like ths for a while Cobalt.It would give you a chance to develop your loop technique and make it more consistent and focussed on spin and placement without the speed factor in there so much.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"There are some who prefer to loop with Hurricane as their fulltime rubber, but most of those I know have a power loop game that doesn't need a faster rubber."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Most would step up from H3 to a tensor once they've honed their loop...which would always be an option for you again of course.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Just repeating what I've read here on the forum - Hurricane 3 is quite slow, and that slowness helps in the short game."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,The slowness comes from the tack of the topsheet.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,But if you put some muscle into the drive you'll get plenty of speed out of it.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"To me is sounds much like the ""exponential"" (as opposed to ""linear"") control mapping that model fliers use - move the sticks a little, the flying surfaces move a little and so you've got a fine degree of control over the middle of the range."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"However, bang the stick to the full extent of travel and you get full travel, so you're still capable of doing violent maneuvers or have the use of full control surface movement if you need it."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,It's also interesting that the top Chinese players use it on the forehand and use something like Tenergy on the backhand.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,And they flip the racket around if they're hitting lobs.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I just bought a sheet of it myself (got it for quite a bit less than the Eacheng price from the DHS booth at the WTTC), I plan to put it on one of my N11s and find out for myself."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I also do plan to Seamoon it to see what the effect is, after I've tried it in the natural state."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I don't expect much - I've seen mention that a lot of Chinese tacky rubbers behave in the same way, except they're not as tacky as H3 - and to be honest, I often can't tell one rubber from the next."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Of course, this isn't the same rubber the top players use - the sponge isn't the same color!"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Iskandar
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I think it's going to feel very dead compared the Victas...it's a completely different rubber.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"H3 also varies a LOT from sheet to sheet, H3 Neo as well but not to the same extent."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Not sure if you were referring to H3 or H3 Neo?
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I recently switched one of my rubbers to Xiom Sigma.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I thought I'd be using it on my forehand to loop with as my FH is my dominant stroke considering that it was a tensor.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I thought it would be better for looping and tried it on for a few games.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Now I'm back to using H3neo on my FH.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,It felt like I could give my stroke a lot of effort on H3 and still be able to land it while I couldn't say the same for Xiom Sigma.I guess it would still really depend on what kind of tensor you intend to get.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"As with most cases, the best way to determine the answer to your question would be to try it for yourself hehe.It's just great that we got a lot of good people in the forum to help guide you with your decision."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Today I tested Hurricane 3-50 mid 2.1 mm and Victas VS 401 2.0 mm on the same blade (DMS Destroyer, all+ carbon blade with low throw)."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,They were both well used and I had just tuned the 401 while H3-50 was tuned like 6 months ago (still soft though).
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I wanted to see if the throw was similar, and they were, perhaps a little higher on 401."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Speed on loop against loop (against the robot) were a little more on 401.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,But the difference was not very clear.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,But the feeling is different.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,And even though it has a hard sponge it still feels softer than the H3-50.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,And looping technique had to be a little different.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I was not able to test loop against backspin, maybe later."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Will dead be a bad thing though?
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I'm thinking of heading this way for the next 6 months to a year, can't see it hurting."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"If in that time I've not taken a step forward then after that it probably doesn't matter as I've given it a good shot.Next question could be H3, H3 NEO or some other variant."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Perhaps a better way to ask is which one is most like Haifu Whale II which I like (apart from the weight).
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I've asked this same question - what's the difference between all those H2/H3 and TG3 variants, and it's hard to get an answer without lots of hedging!"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"And I think the reason is that, although there are differences, the differences are subtle rather than huge."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"You'd have to mount them on identical blades, then test them back to back while really concentrating before being to write a few lines about how they differ, and a lot (most?)"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"people would probably fail when asked to identify which is which, blind."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,So I'd just buy whatever's cheapest at the time!
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Iskandar
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I've spent a lot of time with DHS rubbers, and my old coach used to import and sell DHS rubbers all over Europe, and we've discussed it at length, so I can speak with some experience."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I'm confining this to the 8 variants of Hurricane and Skyline, before the newest generation came out.The Neo rubbers (H2N and H3N, and Skyline Neo TG2/TG3) simply refer to the next generation of the rubber of equivalent name."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,So Skyline 2 Neo is just the next generation of Skyline 2.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"All these rubbers are designed for a post-speed glue world, and are a little faster, as they are tuned."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"They come in a vacuum-sealed pack, and have a somewhat softer and more porous sponge."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"However after a month or two the tuning wears off, and they slow down, and need to be reglued."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I've never boosted, so I can't speak to that.Hurricane 2 is the oldest of the family, and dates from the time of the 38mm ball and speedglue."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Hurricane 3 is basically a Hurricane 2 designed for the 40mm ball.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"The Skyline family weren't designed as 'mass market' allround rubbers, and are much newer, coming out in 2007, and designed for the short game (Skyline 2) and continuous looping (Skyline 3) that was characteristic of two of the top chinese players at the time (Ma Lin and Wang Hao)."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I had a chance to speak to my old coach this morning, and he said that Skyline 2 is best for playing close to the table, and Hurricane 2 is good away from the table if you have a big and powerful loop.In today's game the only people I know using non-NEO Hurricane or Skyline are either people who haven't changed their rubbers in ages, people who still glue, or defenders, as the characteristic of, especially, H2 is that it works excellently as a chopping rubber.If you want to go this way, I would look at Hurricane 3 Neo, or, maybe one of the latest generations such as Hurricane 8 or Skyline 3-60."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Personally I think Skyline 3 Neo is a stunner of a rubber, and much underrated."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,H3-50 mighy be worth a try.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I have read several people that love the h3 or h3 neo don't really care for the h3-50, but I have found that it suites my game and it's a little more forgiving."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,It's seems one step towards a euro rubber while remaining closer to what dhs Chinese rubber does best.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"It's great in the short game, it's spinny, counter looping with this rubber feels great."

31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"This was at the DHS booth at the WTTC:I got the ""ordinary"" H3 for RM60 (about USD13.50), which was a really good deal."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,But I'm wondering now if the Neo (right next to it) was the same price.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"They wanted RM100 for H8, and RM75 for 3-50, Skyline 3-60 was also RM75."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,These were all good prices (especially when you see what H8 goes for online... Eacheng wants a whopping $79!)
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"but I wasn't in the mood to spend large amounts of money just to compare Hurricanes, based on the tiny differences I've been seeing between rubbers in general.They had ""National"" for RM270, but they sold out by Friday!"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Also a variety of other rubbers - Tin Arc for instance (anyone know what it's really for?).
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Iskandar
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I haven't used Hurricane 3.I just recently switched from Donic Coppa X1Turbo to Hurricane 8.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,H8 is much better with control and has many gears.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I would suggest it.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Some of Chinese National Team are using it now.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Their version top sheet is the same as everyone can buy.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,The hurricane rubber line works better when you pair it with a blade that has harder outer plies in combination with the hard sponge DHS uses on their hurricane line.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Presently speaking more people are interested in hurricane than they are in tenergy.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I prefer hurricane 3 because of the better you control you get over tenergy even though I really like tenergy I feel on service and defence hurricane gives you more options on how you want to use the rubber tenergy always will spin the ball in one trajectory mid - high every single time and if you are not playing 5 days a week you cannot change that.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,DHS have successfully made hurricane 3 a commercial rubber at different price ranges as well as a professional rubber at different sponge hardness and boosted or not boosted.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,DHS is probably the most talked about rubber at my club if we discuss equipment because there are a lot of types and sometimes hurricane 3 types have no differences between them and the price of DHS can go through the roof.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,One problem with DHS equipment is their quality control.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,You can get two sheets of hurricane 3 commercial and they will play completely different.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Butterfly do not have this issue and all their equipment they produce feels identical to one another.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"No real winner here, though personally I think Hurricane 3 is the best rubber on the market."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Iskandar I tried tinarc five and it doesn't feel that much different from usual hurricane 3 I think it is marketed for westerners but even then I used it on a blade that had soft outer plies and it was really slow and lacked topspin.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Tin Arc is probably a softer version of Hurricane 3 topsheet or sponge.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I think .
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Only saying this because Hurricane 3 Neo, Provincial, Blue, Orange are the same rubber but they vary from one way or another."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,The main difference is boosting with Hurricane 3 and the sponge they boost with a better quality topsheet from the factory.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,They work off a number on the back but they make so much DHS hurricane 3 quality control lacks and some people have bought normal DHS3 and said it was better than a pricier hurricane 3 blue provincial.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"What I wonder, though, is if the various Hurricanes are really all that different from some of the more expensive offerings (or even the cheaper ones) from Yinhe, Haifu, Sanwei and 729."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I've resisted buying Hurricane until now because it IS relatively expensive - $25-30 or so including shipping from Eacheng.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Yeah, the Chinese national team uses it, but that's likely because they're willing to tailor the sheets to the needs of particular players, and maybe it's got some tiny advantage over other sheets."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"It's probably the biggest seller in China because the CNT uses it, rather than for any other reason."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,One wonders what regional teams use - surely there are some who are sponsored by the other companies and use their rubber.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"As for me, I find it hard to tell one sheet from another, sometimes!"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I'm hoping against hope this sheet of Hurricane 3 I bought will at least feel different... Another reason why I've not gotten any DHS rubbers - back in the 1980s I bought a sheet of PF4 - and the topsheet proceeded to come off quite soon after I bought it.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Iskandar
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Hurricane 3 lasts a very long time and it is pretty good when boosted.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,DHS are in a contract with China Table Tennis and have been given money for their research and development of the rubber that is why the provincial and above is expensive.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,In addition DHS is a manufacturer and it is left to distributors and supplies to sort out their product and how much their willing to sell at what price.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I'm more cynical.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I think the National and Regional sheets are expensive because that's what the market will bear.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"In other words, there are lots of gullible people out there who will pay through the nose for them."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"They probably don't cost any more to make than the normal non-National sheets, though they might be a little bit better in some way."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"The REAL National versions, incidentally, are supposedly tailor made for particular players and are marked with their names."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"As such, sheets for one player would be different than those made for another."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Somehow some of these sheets ""get loose"" - the players have extra, so they sell or give them away to others."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"It's even gotten to the point where other companies are putting out ""National"" versions of their rubbers complete with blue sponge and simplified covers (never mind that no famous Chinese National Team player actually uses them..)."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,We haven't even mentioned the counterfeiting phenomenon yet..  Iskandar
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I think I share you cynicism iskandar taib
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I'm slightly more cynical about the newest range of rubbers, which claim to be optimised for the new ball, but that said, now I'm used to the new ball, I can definitely tell if we're using an older one."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"It's noticeably smaller, and faster and spinnier, so maybe there's something in it.However, given that a standard H3N can be picked up for about £12, I think it represents very good value for money."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I've not experienced any quality issues either.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Off topic but since it's my thread.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,...The robot was out at practice on Monday with balls flying around everywhere as usual.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,We normally use Dhs 3* celluloid on comp nights but last night someone had gone and put balls out of the robot out for use on comp night.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"We had all sorts of things out including Dhs 3*, Andro 3*, Double Fish 3*, Dhs 1*, Chinese no name rip off 3* and believe it or not and old Nittaku 3* 38mm."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,No one had any idea so that's how much i think the balls affect average club players.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Then again we're probably not average.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I'm surprised the robot could feed that 38mm ball!
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Put it away for old times' sake, take it out when you want to knock around with it a bit to see how different they were."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"That last batch of balls I got from Minkow included a small number of their old 38mm celluloid balls, without a brand stamp."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"No idea how old they were - the factory was OEM'ing for DHS, Joola, Stiga among others."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"They were round and hard, definitely 3 star balls."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"And I got the last of their celluloid 40mm balls, too..  Iskandar"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"There are a couple of things I notice about Tin Arc - first, on the more expensive DHS premades, they will put Hurricane 3 on one side (I presume the forehand side) and Tin Arc on the backhand."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"And then, when I visited the DHS website a year or so ago, I noticed that H3 came with harder sponges than Tin Arc did (38,39,40, etc."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"vs. 34,35 etc.)"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"They've changed the website and they don't seem to use ""degrees"" any more."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Now, if you look at it.. H3 is SLOWER (88 vs. 98) and has more SPIN (95 vs. 93) and CONTROL (57 vs. 52) than Tin Arc 3 (with the med."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,sponge OR the soft sponge - same ratings).
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,I suppose it makes sense - the top Chinese players use Tenergy 05 or similar on the backhand and Hurricane of some sort on the forehand.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Tenergy is faster than Hurricane.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,They actually flip the bat around when hitting lobs.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Note that Haifu has a similar pairing - Whale and Shark.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,There are probably others.

31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Here's something bizarre.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Yesterday I set up the table in the lobby at lunchtime because it was World Table Tennis Day, and set out some cheap bats and a couple of balls so people could hit around if they wanted to."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,One of the cheap bats was a Double Fish premade I bought at a Mr. DIY store last year.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I remember hitting with it briefly, after which I carefully put back the plastic protection sheets, zipped it up in its case and put it away."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Well, I take it out, thinking I'll put it out.. and what do I notice?"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,An anti-counterfeiting sticker!
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"That you scratch off, just like the DHS ones!"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I hadn't realized what it was, but since I'd just had to deal with one on the H3 I bought, I knew exactly what it was this time."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Looks just like a DHS one, too, has a 16 digit number once you've scratched it."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"No idea how to use it, though - says to go to doublefish.com, can't figure out what to do after that."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Who the heck would want to counterfeit a $4 Double Fish premade anyway????

31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,OH!
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,This is bizarre!
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"I went to the DHS verification page and entered the Double Fish number, and this happened...."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"So I suppose it's a GENUINE $4 Double Fish (er, ""Pisces"") premade... Whoopee...   Iskandar"
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Hah!
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"How funny, Iskander.Late to the party on this thread, but coming from someone who uses T05 on the forehand, H3 was.. interesting."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Service was a lot spinnier.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"Because the sponge wasn't punishing me on minute angle differences, it was easier to get really heavy underspin over the net at low height."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"(My H3 had 3 layers of Falco Long Booster, btw)."
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Catching counter loops seemed easier as well.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Not as much upward motion needed to throw the ball back on the table.Away from the table you miss that spring sponge feeling.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,That's for sure.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,More effort is required.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Service + at table play = I liked the DHS H3.Everything else = I prefer Tenergy.Tenergy was only minutely worse than the DHS in the categories I thought the H3 was better at.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,So I ended up just switching back.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,Was a fun experiment though.
31,5f6c288b4272aba9ab775720,Hurricane 3 vs Tensors,"and that is the exact reason i stayed on H3...i never go away from the table so that ""little"" improvements had a huge impact on my game...i started winning some matches bcs i could serve heavy underspin in comparison with not so heavy before...that subtle (or not so subtle) difference is enough when you are playing a same strength opponent who usually kill your every serve, but now all of a sudden have to push it..."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"I think very few people have used the new 729-2, so you're unlikely to get much feedback...."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,Like Haggisv said its just relatively new and not many people have tried it.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,Comparing the 729-2 Transcend to the Focus 2 can be done.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"The 729-2 is a much more versatile rubber, its not as fast as the focus 2 but it can do everything with a higher degree of control."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,The focus 2 is a awesome looping rubber once its been loosened up with a few layers of glue.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,As to which ones better....cant say as we all play differently
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,Yes that's true too... the 729-2 transcend is not really a looping rubber so it's hard to compare the rubbers.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"The new 729-2 does sound like it's totally different, here's the only info I have:"

32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,Heh..
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,I have a sheet of 729-2.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,I bought it because of the packaging.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Look on any web site that sells it, and you see this:Why is it so freakishly long?"
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Maybe this just covered the top part of the rubber, while the rest of the rubber hung down below (and was probably wrapped in plastic)?"
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,So I ordered a sheet just to find out..
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,Turns out it really is long.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"The height is enough to cover the entire rubber sheet, but the cardboard (very nice glossy cardboard, too, such as they use on the more expensive 729 rubber packets) extends past the rubber to the right."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"I can imagine this plays hob with those who ship and store rubber - you need different boxes, you can't fit as many on a pallet, etc."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Here's what the back looks like:There's two compartments, with separate flaps."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,The compartment on the right (looking from the back of the packet) contains the rubber.
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,The compartment on the left?
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"No, it's not empty."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Nor, to my great disappointment, did it contain some neato 729 advertising pamphlet explaining the differences between 729, 729FX, 729-2, 729-3, 729-4, 729-5, 729-6, 729-7 and 729-8."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Instead, it contained this:Yes, another lousy rubber protector (like I need more - Eacheng send me free ones, I've got at least a couple dozen already)."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Some more scans of the packaging (the back of the swing-out flaps):A larger image of this ""sensor"" business:So I suppose if you want to ""reduce energy consump-tion"" you'd buy this rubber."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"What is this ""sensor"" technology, really?"
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Just more of the usual rubber marketing gobbledygook you find on the back of most rubber packets, it doesn't mean anything."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"The topsheet and sponge:Note the topsheet does say ""729-2"", so it's a different mold (compared to the one used for plain 729) and a distinct item in the LARC, though I suspect parts of these topsheet molds can be exchanged (note the ""-2"" seems to be separate from the ""729"" in its box)."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"Also the (presumably anti-counterfeiting) Holographic Seal of Excellence, and the ubiquitous 729 Inspection Sticker (in this case Inspector Number 9 put his/her seal of approval on the rubber)."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"The sponge, if it's really 45 degrees, is quite hard."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,So how does it play?
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"How would I know, I've not tried it yet..."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"I was going to, and I was going to make this a post under my ""Training Rubbers"" topic, but I sorta lost interest after the packaging mystery was solved - this was late August, last year, based on the date stamps on the files."
32,5f6c28994272aba9ab775729,New 729-2 SENSOR VS 729 Focus II,"I suspect it's going to be much like the dozens of other Chinese $10 rubbers out there - perhaps slightly faster, if at all, than the $5 rubbers, but I doubt most people could tell the difference."

33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Are you good at twiddling?
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Do you win a lot of points like this?
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"Can you sustain, say, 100+ shots in a three or five point FH/BH training drill, including twiddles?I ask because I'm pretty convinced that unless you're a very skilled player, twiddling introduces a greater error margin, and complicates one's game."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),I twiddle very rarely as a shareholder.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"I grew up playing penhold, and learned RPB in recent years, but found penhold twiddling much harder."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"I guess I'm just questioning whether you are actually getting observable benefit from not just using dedicated FH and BH rubbers, and not worrying about penhold twiddling."

33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Yes.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),I'm confident on my twiddle game.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),I usually only twiddle once in a match after serve.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"I start with invert to serve for more spin, then I have a choice."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"I can start with traditional inverted forehand penhold with a med/long pip block on the reverse, or I have pips on forehand and I use the reverse just to attack."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"On a forced defense/slow return, I twiddle to change the short/long angle from forehand/backhand.I'm using a light tacky invert rubber right now and although I can hit well with my forehand, my reverse loop suffers."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),So I need some more lift and I can sacrifice some hitting on the forehand since I can always twiddle to pips if I need to hit.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),So the priority is to give a good backhand rubber.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Outlaw was my forhand rubber till I went to S. China.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),It was totally useless in high humidity.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),I'd be tempted to go for something middle of the road...
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"I don't know either of the ones you suggest, but I'd look to something like, perhaps, DHS Memo."

33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),I'm in SoCal and we never have that problem haha.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"Yepp, good rubber except in humidity."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Green Dragon is slow-ish.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),And it's very light.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Changing to anything else will add weight to your racket.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),"Can't say much about Battle, but I'd avoid Gold Star like the plague."
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Why?
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),The two sheets I bought delaminated after a very short while.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),As for any rubber (particularly Chinese rubber) being AMAZING - I've ceased to buy any line of this sort.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),I often can't tell the difference between them.
33,5f6c28a74272aba9ab775733,Twiddle Attack Rubber (Focus 3 Snipe vs Outlaw),Differences tend to be subtle rather than glaring (the one exception being Corbor Ckylin).

34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"No, they are not the same, and, no, you can't boost one to get it to play like the other."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"I'm not sure what you're referring by ""nat""."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"If you mean National, it's much harder to get H2 in any versions (prov/nat) other than commercial version."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"I tried H2 various times over the year, but found it even harder to use than H3."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"If you're not familiar with H3 at all, I suggest to forego the idea of using H2."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,For newer alternative you could try TG3 3-60 instead.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Rockpish's keeping it 100 man!
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Seriously the only reason you go H2 is if you already got one in hand, given a choice always go to the safer route, as h3 is more well tested by ppl in this era and times."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Maybe you already know this, but it is worth mentioning:H2 has a very low throw angle and is designed for flat hitting, not for looping."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,So H2 is a close range attack rubber.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,It's not designed for the mid-range game.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"And, as you know, H3 has a high throw angle and is a looping rubber."

34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Both were meant to be speed glued (back when it was legal).

34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"That would be me There's value in any of the older DHS range, but you wouldn't be using them as they were intended."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Any non-neo DHS rubbers in the skyline/hurriane range (and likely others, 666, 777, 888 etc) were all designed to be speedglued."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"The Neo rubbers are the ""factory tuned"" modern ones."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"However, the latest range, 3-60, 3-50, Hurricane 8 etc are all the current DHS rubbers."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"They're very good indeed, and not expensive, compared to Euro/Jap rubbers."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,I wouldn't bother with older DHS rubbers unless you already have some unopened ones ready to use.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"That said, though.."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"I doubt most lower-level players (even tournament players) were speed gluing even in the 1980s and 90s, and definitely not in the 1970s, when Double Happiness inverted sheets first started appearing (back then, just PF4, together with the original purple 729)."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Just as Sriver wasn't designed for speed gluing, I don't think PF4 was either."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Speed gluing was ""discovered"" after the rubbers came out."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"I missed the entire time period when 666, 888 and the Hurricanes appeared (wasn't playing)."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"The only Double Happiness sheet I bought in the 1980s was this one sheet of PF4, which almost immediately developed a bubble."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,As a result I never bought another one until recently.

34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,I think PF4 is a hidden gem.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Maybe not very hidden, but it's unfashionable, yet it can do everything well."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Great rubber.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"I think I wrote that badly - I didn't buy another sheet of PF4, I bought H3 recently."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Yeah, PF4 would be unfashionable like 729, or even Sriver and Mark V. That's what comes from being old hat, I suppose.."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"The DHS line is quite large - aside from the ""old classic"" rubbers (G555-G888 and PF4), there's also the Tin Arc/Gold Arc line, the Dippers, the Memos, TNT."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,No one ever talks about them.Iskandar
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"My old coach used to import DHS stuff into the UK, so we talked about this stuff a lot."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,My first bat when I started playing again 4 years ago had TNT on one side and Dipper on the other.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"At the time a few people were using Tin Arc - one person I kow still uses it, and swears by it."
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,I think Memo III is a fantastic rubber.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Insane amounts of spin.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,One of the best choppers in our amateur league play with DHS PF4 for the last 20 years i think:)and it is still tacky like the 1st day...
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,The same sheet???
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Wow.Had to see what it costs - about $10-11 from Eacheng.
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Some other places have it for about $8.

34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,Haha i mean one reason they cut corners for their rubbers is because they dont want it to be mistaken as national or prov version?
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"Am i wrong i mean in normal hurricane, does it apply to pf4 too?"
34,5f6c28c94272aba9ab775748,hurricane 2 vs h3 nat compared,"I suspect, even back in the 1960s and 70s, DHS (and other companies - in particular Friendship) was supplying custom rubber sheets to National players."

35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,How would you compare these rubbers to Victas VS 15 Limber or Extra?
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I've hit with bot the EL-P and MX-P and they are a surprisingly good pair of rubbers.The EL-P I hit with was on a Timo Boll ALC in 2.1m and it had a really good glue effect like you said.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Nice arc and stable play, I didn't think it was quite as fast as the T05 though, but that could just be my perception of how it played as there is not much difference between the two in my opinion."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,The MX-P (in 2.1m) sponge was much firmer then I though it was going to be and it was actually recommended to me as a backhand rubber.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,It was more direct then the EL-P and was surprisingly easy to generate spin and hit with considering the firmness of the sponge.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I enjoyed it both forehand and backhand and it played like it was a little softer then the sponge firmness suggested it would.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I cant be certain without a more current test and comparison but I remember thinking that it was faster then the T05 but again, that could just be me... and time between when I tried them out."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"As a series of rubbers I think the Evolution range quite underrated in the TT community here in Oz, maybe because you can get a BlueFire or Hexer (again both from ESN) cheaper then the Evolution from most stores locally?"
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I don't know, but they are a good set of rubbers."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I got 2 sheets of EL-P about 3 years ago replacing a red T05 on the FH with an EL-P on an IF ZLC.At the time there was a lot of hype on the Evolution rubbers being the same sheets that the Pros get and there was a lengthy review of a black MX-P on myTT.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Spoke with a former international based in NI who was an agent for these rubbers and he was using the EL-P on the FH and FX-P on the BH.- Anyway when I used the EL-P I was disappointed with it having come from T05.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I had high hopes for it.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Have a clear recollection that it felt dead compared with T05 with it lacking a bit of spark.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I off loaded it but did recommend it to a former club member who had an unorthodox side swipe stroke who performed quite well with it at the European Vets.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,He used it on both sides in a lighter 1.9 but has since changed the BH to a Super Defence.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,EL-P was a fractionally heavier than T05.Of the Evolution rubbers I was impressed with the MX-P using it on the FH of a Hurricane King which felt substantially harder that a T05 which was on the BH.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Definitely felt more speedy but less spinney with less arc.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,The FX-P was another club mates blade which was a ZJ SZLC and compared with the T80 that was on the other side (I twiddled) the FX-P felt surprisingly better.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I had discounted the EL-P and if I was opting for Evolution be inclined to go with MX-P on the FH but on a slower blade than what I'm using.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,FX-P particularly on the BH stands out as an exceptional rubber.Just wondering if they have improved on the EL-P so that it is now a better rubber ?Based on your review I would re-consider a EL-P if I was recommending a OVP or something similar.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Thanks Multispoke  It almost sounds like you had a dud sheet, or a very different blade for the EL-P, because I find it's considerably more lively than T05."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Has it changed?
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Possibly.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I don't recall which blade I used it on, but I'm pretty sure is was an OFF- relatively stiff wooden blade."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"The liveliness came mostly from the topsheet though, so I doubt the blade could make that much difference.I hear the FX-P feels closer the Tenergy FX series, certainly is hardness and trajectory."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I agree, and think it's probably due to marketing and availability...there really weren't any active Tibhar Reps in AU."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Prices were also usually a little higher (closer now), which may also be related to lower volumes of sales in AU."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"i have switched from t05 to mxp couple of years ago and never looked back...it is faster than t05 on the fast swing and slower on pushes and slow balls which means more control...sponge is a little harder, for me that is a big plus, for someone else a minus...trajectory of the ball is lower than t05 which i love...my every spin is going low and fast, and still hitting the table...very hard to block...again, for me a plus, for someone else a minus...top surface is grippier than t05, more like Chinese rubbers, so its better for serving...there is softer and harder sponge variant...harder is mx-s...more like h3 in a european way...even lower trajectory than mx-p, more grippy, little slower...perfect bh rubber for pushing, serving and blocking...for fh little too slow unless you have chinese full powerfull stroke to fully penetrate the hard sponge...than its a killer...also very good for tuning...softer are fxp and elp...for me too soft and lively...these are for ppl that like t64...if you dont have enough power they are better than mxs bcs they will speed up your shots...very good if you are standing little further from the table...because they have higher throw and catapult...all and all, really under appreciated rubbers that need more exposure...ask if you have any more questions..."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Your thoughts and experience mirror what I found with EL-P. And it happened about the same time period, Maybe we received old sheets, just dull sheets."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I know this happens, one of my latest batch of Bluefire was very different from what it normally is."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,A local coach thinks the sheet of Bluefire was over-boosted from the factory.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,It did smell very strong of booster.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I haven't tried any newer batches of EL-P to see if they have changed.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I play about 1850 level on the US rating, so part of my perceived difference could be from different playing level/skill sets between reviewers."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Had a hit with both MX-P (forehand) and FX-P (backhand), both max, for a short time yesterday."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,The reason I'm reporting my thoughts is that the FX-P was massively different to the rubber I'm currently using so thought someone might find the information useful.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Sometimes with rubbers I can notice a bit of difference but often not much.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,This was big.The rubbers were on a Yasaka William Henzell which I think is ALL / ALL+.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"My blade, the Donic Appelgren Allplay V1 shouldn't be a lot different."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"On forehand I'm using Baracuda and for the few hits I had I didn't notice much difference, though not saying they aren't there, the time I spent hitting, it wasn't obvious.On the backhand however the FX-P compared to my Yasaka Original Extra XHG was a huge difference."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,When blocking the ball was sailing well long and with backhand topspins the throw seemed very high and I struggled to keep the ball on the table.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I found that I really had to close the face on both blocks and topspins, so much that it felt very foreign.Don't read too much into my findings as it was really only a short hit and I'm sure I would have got used to it quickly but I was really taken aback by the difference."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"To a point that I was considering going a tensor next time on my backhand but now I'm not so sure but it definitely won't be FX-P as for me, at my level it was too hard to control."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"For a better player the added speed, and spin is likely a benefit, to a lower player a hindrance."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I wouldn't read too much into this.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"When I looked back over my notes from when I started experimenting with putting some sponge behind my SP, the difference was very significant, and this was even allowing for the fact that the blade with the sponged SP was much slower than the blade with the Dr Evil."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Based on my initial experience, I was sure that sponge wasn't for me, and that especially on my fast blade, I wouldn't want to play with or have the degree of control I was used to."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"However, we soon make corrections."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Even something that feels like a big difference isn't really, and our brains soon sort it out."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Now, if I play with Dr Evil, I am struck my how much effort I need to put into my shots, and were it my first hit, I would swear that I wouldn't want to use it as my FH rubber, when in fact, I used it very successfully for some time!"
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,If you're using Baracuda on the FH the FX-P would have been the better choice on the FH.I would have rated the FX-P as a more up-to-date tensor than the old school Baracuda which is more spin sensitive.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,If you were looking for a control orientated BH rubber that's kinda slow - sometinhg like a tibhar auris might suit.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Other slighter faster options could be Joola rhymn, joola xplode sensitive..."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I agree with this pretty much.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"It is surprisingly different from MX-P, really a quite different feel, but some T05 users may actually like EL-P better."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I'm not sure why, but after using T05 for the last 7 years, I found EL-P was easier to adapt to on my FH than on my BH."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Right now, I am still using T05.By the way, last time I bought sheets of EL-P was about 4 months ago."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"They were certainly not dead.My experience with MX-P was that it feels very very different from T05, but amazingly, you can play with it pretty much exactly the same way, with almost zero time to adjust, and most shots seem to end up exactly the same."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Odd, eh?"
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"For me, over about a 30 day trial (the longest I have played with any rubber not named T05 on my FH, I felt like MX-P reduced margin for error very slightly."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,And so I kept with T05.MX-P and EL-P are both pretty heavy.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"I don't much care, but some people might."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Someone argued that EL-P plays a bit better on flexy all-wood blades.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I can see that - I liked it for a while with my brush forehand on a Yasaka Extra.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I didn't realize it wasn't the T05 I thought I was using.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,I've been using mxp as my forehand rubber for a while now.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Ive not used elp and my time with t05 is a while ago, but from what I recall mxp seems a bit more controllable and linear; less spring and less sensitive to spin."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"Elp doesn't seem popular around here, a number of good players have tried and discarded it."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Mxp forehand and mxs backhand is a popular choice though.Sent from my LG-D855 using Tapatalk

35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,He played with T05fx and it gave him just enough extra control (and confidence) that he beat me 4-1.

35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,This made me curious.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"No one's actually mentioned any PRICES, so I looked up a local dealer (Tenryu) which for me would be one of two ways to actually GET Tenergy."
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,So..Tenergy 05 would cost me RM228 - about USD56 including 6% GST.

35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,"So Tenergy IS more expensive, but not by very much."

35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,So a fairly big difference here Isk.
35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,Evolution is about 60% of the price of Tenergy here (£31 v £50).Sent from my LG-D855 using Tapatalk

35,5f6c290b4272aba9ab775762,Reviewing Tibhar Evolution EL-P vs MX-P vs T05,The T05 was probably a light one.

36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Great review!
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,I've been curious myself about the differences.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,I currently play with Vega Japan and have tried Omega V Tour.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,"I found OVT a little too hard, most likely the topsheet, but it could have been the sponge too."
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,I have always had an itch to try OV Pro since it has the softer topsheet.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,I'd really like to compare it to Vega Japan (which I really like).
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Have you had a chance to try Vega Japan?
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,If so how would you compare it to Omega V Pro?
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,"Great review, thank you Beta!"
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,"Hey,We made very detailed review of both of these rubbers."
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Please have a look: http://blog.tabletennis11.com/xiom-omeg ... ur-reviews
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,That's a very good review on the various rubbers in the omega v range.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,I received a text from a French guy who borrowed a setup from me and he was looking for some details on it.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,It was a XVE flared with OVT & OVE.Like Patrick I found the OVE harder than the rated 42.5 & it didn't suit me but quite a lot of fellow club players like it on the BH.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Was rated by a Japanese review as being one of the top BH rubbers.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Some of our harder hitters found that the XVE went long on the FH where it lost its arc.OVT I initially enjoyed but having returned back to a bouncier T05 prefer the better spin & arc.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,In some ways MX-P is a better rubber but possibly too fast on a fast blade.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,OVT is a good FH rubber and is a resonable weight with good control.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,OVP didn't really do it for me and felt a bit like an in between rubber not excelling in any one area.What OFF- blade is Patrick using and is he using a seamless or seamed ball for testing ?Interesting a Division 1 sparring 'partner' has changed from MX-S and Vega Japan to OVA & OVE for the FH & BH respectively.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,I was surprised that he went with the Asia since I thought it was slightly old school.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Asia seems popular with some of our better players.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,A recent Brazilian coach is using it on her FH.Going back to the OV series the black carbo sponge feels a little cheap and it's difficult getting glue off it given the porous pores.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Often wondered if the thicker donic blue glue was more suitable for it.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,Would have thought that the evolution no.
36,5f6c29114272aba9ab775766,Xiom Omega V Pro vs Omega V Tour,3 glue would be more or less impossible to get off.Again many thanks for posting the useful blog.

37,5f6c29314272aba9ab775778,Free victas vs401 1.8 mm red,Pm me your address.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I have seen players use both.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I suspect it a matter of taste.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,What standard are you?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,My preference is Tenergy 64.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"I'd probably prefer a slightly lower speed, but I find that to be of lesser importance than the lower throw angle and softer feel of Tenergy 64.Steven"
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Birding and Joo use T64.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Gionis uses T05.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,All of them are high level players.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"As I said, I think its a matter of taste."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,My Danish rating is about 1550 - it is about 1750 usatt.Does anybody have trouble clearing the net on loops with T64 - this is my biggest concern.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I dont understand the question?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,How can one have trouble clearing the net with loops with T64?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Compared to T05 the throw angle is signifacantly lower is it not ?From away from the table it might be more diffecult to cleat the net ?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"It's a matter of taste, the 2 rubbers are quite different, both are reliable for the style.64 is significantly softer and lighter than 05, it's quite faster and has much lower throw and arc, and it's somewhat less spin sensitive."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I think many defenders prefer it for its speed in attack and the lower arc of the chop.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"I'd say that if you rely on heavy spin you should go for 05, whereas if you want speed you should go for 64."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"If you have good FH tecnique you will land your loops with every rubber, i think it's more a matter of ""how you want your loop to be""."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"From far from the table 64 helps to bring the ball back with its speed, fishing is definitely better with it."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Try looking at t05/t64 sheets back to back, the only diff is pip geometry and you can hard tell them apart."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,The performance of the rubber will probably change more in the first few weeks.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"The only significantly different tenergy is t25 which has large pips.Of course if you read web reviews, there are those who swear up and down one is ""faster/harder"" than the other AND vice versa: http://mytabletennis.net/forum/forum_po ... ?TID=39368 vs RevanII above, which demonstrate how reliable that process is."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Web reviews are not so much reliable overall indeed... you should always compare, expecially when it comes to personal feelings, but about physical features you can have a good idea."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Don't listen to 1 person, compare opinions and look at the coherence of the statements...About 05-64, you know, we can talk about hardness of the rubber surface (which can be compared also by the weight of the rubber, and since 05 is heavier it's not difficult to tell which one is harder... maybe we can talk about which one ""feels"" harder) but if 64 were slower than 05 it would simply be a worse rubber, since everyone agrees 05 is spinnier-higher arc..."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,It sure felt great to see myself being in the same two sentences as Joo and Gionis.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I read this post yesterday during lunch.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,It made me feel like leaving work and heading off to the table tennis.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,(Of course this wasn't feasible since the table tennis club wasn't open and I had a lot of work to do.)
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Of course, when I was at my best, 40 years ago, I was nowhere near the level of a top defender like Joo or Gionis.For me, the biggest challenge using Tenergy 64 is age-related."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I move so much more slowly now than I did years ago.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"As a result, I am out of position a lot."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Tenergy 64 is not very forgiving when chopping from out of position with less than ideal technique.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"However, when I am in position, with its spin, speed, low throw, etc., chopping is wonderful.Steven"
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Perhaps I should have said 'high class players' .
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Once you have class you have it for life - im sure you still play sweetly.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,A lady at our club was a state champion in the 50s or 60s.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Shes 76 now and not in great shape but her class is obvious to those who have played a bit.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"All tenergy is made from same material in terms of elasticity (FX has softer sponge), but differ slightly in pip geometry & density (except t25 which differs significantly, the large pips imply lower throw)."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"The reader is left to judge how mountains are made of this molehill.On the general topic of what's ""better"" for modern def, for offense you'll want something bit faster than playing at the table, which means it'll suck for chopping topspins anyway except from quite far away."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,There's no magical rubber than's faster on topspin strokes and slower for backspin ones.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I'm not a defender at all (!!
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"), but I've used Tenergy since about six months after it came out, on my forehand anyway."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Not too long after T80 came out, I tried it, and it felt not as good on my FH but it very good on my BH, so that's what I've been using there."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I still use T05 on my FH.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Yesterday I was doing some drills for a friend and wasn't paying too much attention except trying to give him a really clean ball according to a specific pattern of placement and I noticed that I had flipped my blade and was using T05 on my BH and it just felt really good.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Not all that much different really, it just seemed like the ball was clearing the net just a little higher but not going off the table, and in any case I was putting the ball right where it needed to be."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"The thing is, it must have been at least a few minutes before I noticed."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I flipped back and it was harder to do the drill.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Flipped again, a little easier."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I can't see any reason why the change to T80 felt so good a year or two ago and why T05 felt so good yesterday (on BH).
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,My strokes and technique have certainly not changed.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I guess it just means that you can probably get accustomed to either one.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,But now I wondering about just using T05 on both sides.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I generally resist making equipment changes but I am thinking that the last complexity the better.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Also, sometimes it turns out that stuff you've thought was true for a long time isn't."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"The one thing I can say is we were using an XSF polyball, maybe that explains it."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Now T80 would be less of a change from T05 than T64 I think.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,You would certainly feel the difference between 05 and 64.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I'm just not entirely convinced it would make a huge difference once you had a little time to grow accustomed to the change.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,The only way to know is to try.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I ordered 64 to replace my 05 and I tried 64 for the first time with amateur opponent.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,This what I found.1.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,They are clearly different rubbers.2.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,64 feels lot faster in powerdrive kind of open blade shots.3.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"64 is lot livelier, softer and bouncier."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,4.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Looping went quite well without adjustment problems.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,More outright winners than usually.5.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Serving, pushing and chopping need adjustments, as you must use the rubber differently."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,The touch is just different.6.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"05 seem to be more predictable, as the liveliness of 64 seem to spread shots wider - at first test at least."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,7.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Fishing wasn't as good with 64 as expected.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Yes, it was faster and bouncier (which is good), but there were directional problems.8."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Serves seem to had lot less spin, but different touch might help9."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Didn't have much chance for blocks, but faster blocking seems to be promising."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"I had to test more agains better opponents, but there were good things and not so good."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,More playing with 64.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"It actually resembles Rakza 7 a lot, but with better top sheet without slipping problems."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Looping seem to work better than ever.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"It's easier to loop than 05, as spin sensitivity is much less and in brush style looping you get lot of dwell from the soft sponge."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I love the bounciness in all kind of top spin shots.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Gears are great from slow loop to exploding drive.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I also love loud sound when hitting hard.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Biggest downside is missing spin from the serves.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,It feels like I have lost half of the spin..
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"I probably have to think new serving strategy.Pushing and blocking seem to need different touch, but will be adjusted in time to come."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Did you weigh them?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"Some hard data, for a change... you have people on the thread saying T64 is lighter than T05 - true or false?"
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Iskandar
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,"t64 dosent have a softer sponge, have the same one as t05, but the wider spaced pips gives a softer felling , and t64 is ligther cause have less pips..."
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Are you 100% sure that's true mano?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,I have always been under the impression that it had a soft sponge and T05's sponge is relatively hard.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,All Tenergy has the same sponge hardness (exept for the softer FX sponges).
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Topsheet differences are the only things making them play and feel differently.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,See that both t05 and t64 have a 36º sponge and the fx have 32º sponge...
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,And that's definitely sponge hardness?
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Wow.
38,5f6c29494272aba9ab77578a,Modern defender - Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 64,Surprised!
39,5f6c294f4272aba9ab77578d,Tenergy 80 vs Tenergy 64 vs Tibhar MX-P,"mxp > T64 > T80it sayd that T80 is between T05 and T64, but i feel it doesnt have anything from T05 and T64"
39,5f6c294f4272aba9ab77578d,Tenergy 80 vs Tenergy 64 vs Tibhar MX-P,"T80 is exactly between T05 and T64, in terms of speed, spin, hardness, throw angle."
39,5f6c294f4272aba9ab77578d,Tenergy 80 vs Tenergy 64 vs Tibhar MX-P,I've used all of them.
39,5f6c294f4272aba9ab77578d,Tenergy 80 vs Tenergy 64 vs Tibhar MX-P,i would say that the throw angle of mx-p is indeed lower that 05...the sponge is also little harder and topshit little grippier

40,5f6c29a24272aba9ab7757be,Nittaku Revspin,I've not heard of this one.
40,5f6c29a24272aba9ab7757be,Nittaku Revspin,Is it a new rubber?
40,5f6c29a24272aba9ab7757be,Nittaku Revspin,Yeah it's a new rubber for defensive play made in Japan.Manufacturers desc.
40,5f6c29a24272aba9ab7757be,Nittaku Revspin,":""Very spinny topsheet combined with softer spring sponge creates amazing feeling for defensive and allround play.It provides excellent control with strong back spin balls against opponent's powerful balls."
40,5f6c29a24272aba9ab7757be,Nittaku Revspin,"Powerful topspin is also available at the counter attack.For plastic ball 40+""I haven't seen it available outside of Japan yet."
40,5f6c29a24272aba9ab7757be,Nittaku Revspin,"Ahh yes, it's made in Japan:Here is the cover:It might be similar to the Victas VS 01 series."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I once hit with SP ULTRA tack with Transcend sponge.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Didn't like it at all.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Felt the Transcend sponge was far too stiff for my liking.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I think this sponge is generally regarded as being hard.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,See these first few reviews.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I tend to agree.http://www.tabletennisdb.com/rubber/729 ... scend.htmlYou have 729 Super FX now so that's a pretty tacky topsheet.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"If you want a fairly tacky topsheet with a soft sponge, they're hard to find."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Seems like generally it's one or the other IMO.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,(non tacky & soft... or Tacky & hard)LKT PRO XT for the money is absolutely the best blend I've tried for a cheaper rubber.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,$14.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Pretty tacky (maybe not quite as much as your Super FX but close) and very soft.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Great feel.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Interesting, I hadn't looked into the LKT you mentioned."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Tackiness isn't really a feature I care too too much about but it does look like it would fit the bill in the sponge properties.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,From what I've felt the transcend was a bit softer than the super fx but I have them on different blades so its quite hard to tell (I don't really have the experience to compare rubbers when ones on an ALL and ones on an OFF blade).
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"But it looks like the LKT is quite softer so maybe I'll try that and if its too soft I'll try to find something in between.Or maybe I'll just get a few different sheets and compare, for the prices that these rubbers are there's really no point in saving $10-15 to play with something that I don't care for."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I think this is how the EJ starts
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I think you'll like the Pro XT.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,It was a favorite of mine.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Looping is a breeze with this.If you find that sponge to be a hair too soft, then you're looking for RITC GeoSpin Tacky."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Just a hair tackier and ever so slightly firmer sponge.Can't really go wrong with either IMO.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Surely trying Transcend on your FH on your OFF blade give you a prety fair indication as to whether it is suitable or not?
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Not sure if this topic is no longer of interest, but from my experience, the best soft sponged tacky rubber sheet is the 729 FX Super Soft."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"This seems to me to feel the same top-sheet as the 729 Super FX which I also love, but gives much better control and softness with the white sponge behind it."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,This enables a great looping game (allbeit slightly slower) where the ball really embeds itself into the sponge with the right technique.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"I can also chop very consistently with good spin which is the main reason I used this.I am generally a defender chopper on backhand long pips (D-Tecs), with forehand being the Super Soft (has to be in black as it seems to make a difference).Hope this sheds some more light on this topic, as some seem to think you cannot get a soft sponged, Chinese, tacky top-sheet rubber."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,In fact this is imo a great combination!
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Tacky with soft sponge - there are varieties of CJ8000 with softish sponge (33 degrees, 35 degrees IIRC), also Yasaka ZAP (which is a lot less tacky, same company makes it)."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"I don't like these rubbers because they're a pain to glue on the blade, having a lot of ""dish""."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I bought a sheet of LKT Pro XT Green Dragon some time back - this a little more expensive than the regular Pro XT which can be had for under $10 including shipping ($8.53 for the next 4 hous..  ):http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shi ... 48540.htmlhttp://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shi ... 57335.htmlThe thing that really struck me about the Green Dragon was it's weight - it only weighs 48 grams uncut!
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,And this is for 2.2mm sponge.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Seems to play OK, if a bit slow."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,I can't really tell the difference between a lot of Chinese rubber.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Still haven't tried Seamooning it.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Iskandar
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Yes those KTL/LKT XT rubbers are always very light, the sponge quite soft and topsheet quite thin."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,The 729 FX super soft also has a thinner and less tacky topsheet compared to the original 729 FX.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Both the 729 FX Super soft and the LKT/KLT XT are only mildly tacky... if they were very tacky they'd be even slower.Many years ago I speed glued the LKT XP, which played very nicely, although the rubber bottoms out too easily."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Heh.. technically all 729 Super FX topsheets are supposed to be the same, but that's never stopped anyone..  Have you tried the Green Dragon?"
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,There's also the even more expensive Silver Dragon.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Not to mention the non-tacky XP series.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Iskandar
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"I agree, on both counts   Yes, different versions with different colour sponges...not a lot of differences in performance I would think."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,The XP is virtually identical to the XT.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"For what it's worth, the Green Dragon sponge (which is green!)"
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,is of the large pore variety.
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Which seems to be in fashion these days (because the Tenergy sponge and the sponge under the most expensive Tensors have large pores).
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,Iskandar
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Although I have not tried any of the 'large pore' Chinese rubbers, I have my doubt that performance will be anywhere near German/Japanese 'large pore' rubbers."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Large pores are easy to copy, but that does not mean it comes with the added performance."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Yeah, it's a fashion."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"729 Battle, KTL Green Dragon, Palio Hidden Dragon 40+... not to mention the special edition 729 Super FX."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"I've decided the Green Dragon's just too plain slow for my Yinhe Kiso 7 blade - I'll either try heavily Seamooning it or replace it with Emperor Dragon, or use it on the backhand."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"It's even slower than Yinhe 9000, which might be a good thing for a backhand rubber."
41,5f6c29a54272aba9ab7757c0,729 Super Fx vs Cream Transcend for FH loops?,"Sort of a shame, it's so light."

42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,And I suppose once Tenergy 05 was out everyone dropped Shark (and probably Tin/Silver/Gold Arc too) for the backhand.Iskandar

42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,I've never played with Sriver or Bryce (let alone speed glued it) but Shark is indeed very much like Japanese rubber and unlike most Chinese stuff.
42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,"It's light (much lighter than whale), and non-tacky."
42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,There's all sorts of stuff posted about it on this forum and elsewhere.

42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,yes i'll be testing shark II tunned today quality looks good and rubber llooks like spin oriented (a promissing rubber  )
42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,I played with this rubber in the soft version.
42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,I liked it with the celluloid ball.
42,5f6c29c54272aba9ab7757d2,Haifu shark II vs blue whale II,It had some spin insensibility although i was able to produce some nice spin balls.Now i'm training with plastic balls i like it a lot less.

43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,its not a new rubber...
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"You're right, it's no longer in the cataglue, and neither is the original Grip-S.  Hopefully at least the Euro one stays around, and that's my favourite."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"What rubbers might be similar to GSE Soft, if I can't get new sheets."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I have tried 2 suppliers and both are out of stock on red 1.8
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I'd suggest try the Euro in 1.8mm.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,That's like going to be the closest.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,BlueWHale II red sponge is the close rubber to it... just get the soft version.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I really liked the Grip S Euro too.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I didn't notice it being heavy tack.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Just light to half tack.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I actually found its playing characteristics to change after 6 weeks but not too drastically.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,The rubber wasn't horrible until about 6 months.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Then it was rough to play.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I wish I still had it to see its boosted performance.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I can still get the Grip Europe rubbers here.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Especially the Grip-Europe-soft caught my attention.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I suppose it has a high throw?
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Is Europe-soft also on the heavy side?
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,My Grip-Europe-soft red 1.8 weighed 59g uncut.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,That included a thick pre-applied glue layer... so you only need to glue the blade
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"that's not too bad, thanks!"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"can someone tell something more about throw, spin and spin sensitivity, speed, comparison with other rubbers?"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"IMO....Speed: (OFF-), linear by which I mean it isn't bouncy on slow shots (unlike some tensors) and quite fast when you give it a full shot.Spin: up there with the best, very spinny serves and loops, pushes have good backspin.Throw: Meduim (a bit higher maybe).Spin sensitivity: I don't find this rubber over sensistive to incoming spin.Hope that helps a bit"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I agree completely with that, that was my experience too, thanks Spartan62"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Too bad I didn't notice this thread or I wouldn't have bought a sheet of Grip-S Europe 1.8mm.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"The sad thing is that its working pretty well, and only took a month to get used to.Now I need to find something else to replace it with that plays as well and similar so it doesn't ruin my game for 6 months learning to hit with it.Any ideas?"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I spoke to Tibhar via email and they said it should be legal for 2 more years, and since my attempt with the Juic 999 Turbo failed, and TT11 put the Grip-S Europe and Grip-S Europe Soft on sale for $26 a sheet, I bought enough sheets to last 12 to 18 months, hopefully."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"The problem is that the 1.8 Europe was too slow to attack with, and they didn't have thicker sheets of that, so I ordered the Europe Soft in MAX, since that's what they had."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I used to play with Donic Vario Big Slam MAX and was able to chop well with it, so I'm hoping/betting the Europe Soft in MAX will work for me, also."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"Does anyone know if you can take this off the blade, remove the glue, and reglue it ok?"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"It seemed to have a glue of some kind already on the sponge when new, and I am thinking that was some kind of factory booster, and not sure if when I peel off the non-voc glue I used, if the factory booster will come off with it, and the rubber will be ruined."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I do know that if I leave the non-voc glue on there and add another layer to the blade that the thing will end up weighing a TON, lol.I guess if I can't reglue it, its garbage."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I need to reduce the size of the blade to get the weight down to where I can swing it quickly enough, and need to remove the rubber to file it down.Otherwise its working pretty well."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Just don't try putting it on an oversized blade and plan on trying to attack with it unless you are the Hercules type.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I bought a sheet of grip s europe soft here in Thailand today, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to glue it on a blade though."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"This is what the sheet looks like 2 hours after removing it from the packaging and removing the protective plastic sheets (no glue on it yet, the shiny stuff was on the sheet already)"
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,That's got to be the worst case of dish I've ever seen.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Worse than Palio CJ8000 even.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I suspect, with Palio, the problem is they don't allow the sponge to ""age"" (like Gouda) long enough before slicing and attaching to the topsheet."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"The sponge shrinks as it ages, up to a point where it stabilizes, and then it's time to slice it and glue it to the topsheet."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Palio is probably cutting corners.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"Here I wonder if the sheet was mis-boosted (er, ""tunned""), or the booster's totally worn off."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Maybe a really heavy dose of Seamoon (or Falco) will fix it.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Iskandar
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"Just got back from playing, the dome on the grip s actually got worse."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,The 2 edges are almost touching.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Write a letter to Tibhar...
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I wonder if that rubber has some sort of ""sell by"" date on the packaging."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,If I were you I'd Seamoon it.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Falco might be better (it really domes up the rubber).
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"I wouldn't even bother removing the glue layer, the booster will soak through the glue."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,The last time I tried gluing a sheet with that much dish on it (CJ8000..) I ended up with a major crease in the topsheet.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Iskandar
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I'll try glueing it tomorrow.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,I got a can of butterfly VOC fair chack glue which seems to be very strong.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"That glue is still available here at a good price btw, 1 liter for about $5.50."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Problem with these VOC speed glues is the effect (swelling of the sponge) only lasts for 3-4 hours.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,After that the sponge shrinks again.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,"Back when these were in use you had to remove the rubber from the blade after playing, otherwise it would shrink while still attached, and this would ""cause undue stress"" to the sponge."
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,With the current no-VOC boosters the effect lasts a month or more.
43,5f6c29c74272aba9ab7757d3,Tibhar Grip-S vs Grip-S Europe vs Grip-S Europe soft Review,Several weeks at least.

44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"First I would like to mention that the entire series of Skyline is designed under the theme of ""control"" and Skyline 3 is unlikly to be lack of control."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,This is why Skyline rubbers are favored by Chinese penhold players because penhold calls for over-table-control.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Same for Ma Long who needs delicate over-table-control.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"What S3 lacks is burst (relative to Hurricane 2,3 and Skyline 2)."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Ma Long and Wang Hao usually like to make a rally rather than a kill shot.I am not that familiar with Haifu rubbers.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,They came to popular after the glue ban before the DHS neo rubbers came out because Haifu first used the factory tune technique.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"However when DHS made their neo rubbers, Haifu soon failed to compete with DHS."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Generally Bluewhales are homogenized to Hurricane 3 rubbers and this might be the reason why its market share declined so quickly after the appearance of neo H3.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"Another reason is, as people have disclosed, that Haifu does not have its own rubber factory, and it looks for various small factories in Tianjin to produce for it."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"Therefore, the quality control might not be so stable and technology capabilities are restricted."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,That might explain changes in Whale II sheet that I've bought.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,The last couple sheets had a very different looking red top sheet.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,The old ones had been translucent while the new ones were very opaque and a more pinkish color.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,This was pretty disturbing to get a radically different looking and performing rubber without any warning that the rubber compound had been changed.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"I gave up on Whale II after that, even though I liked the performance of the older sheets."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Yes that would certainly explain it.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"The Tibhar Grip-S are clearly of better quality and consistancy (and not identical to the blue whale), although even of those I've come across the occasional sheet that played very different."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,The couple of sheets of Whale I have (dark orange sponge) have opaque topsheets - you can't see the pips.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"The sheet of Shark, however, has a transparent topsheet."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"You wonder which of the rubber companies have their own factories - DHS and 729 of course, wonder who else."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"I'm sure 999 (not Globe) OEMs stuff for others, so I think they have their own."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Iskandar
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Huge difference between Haifu rubber and dhs.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,While dhs is non tuned or nothing worth noting.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,The Haifu rubbers are very heavily tuned and MUCH faster.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,I'm still using a three year old sheet of whale soft primarily but also skyline 3 on another blade.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"IMHO the skyline 3 makes more spin but the whale is a much better rubber overall, very much better control and touch."
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Another thing I've been wondering about.
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,Are there any top Euro or Japanese players (other than Chinese transplants) who use Hurricane/Skyline/Grip-S/Whale on the forehand?
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,And are there any top Chinese players who use Tenergy or Tensor rubber on the forehand?
44,5f6c29ca4272aba9ab7757d4,Hurricane vs. Whale vs. ??? Elite Chinese forehand rubber,"It does seem that on the backhand side, as far as top Chinese players go, Tenergy wins out over Tensor and other types."

45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,Much different.
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,80 FX feels a lot softer.
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,I think regular T80 (with regular sponge) is in a lot of ways closer to T25FX.
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,A lot of the overall hardness in T25 (regular or FX) comes more from the topsheet because the pips on the inside are so large.
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,"Using the softer FX sponge seems to cancel some of that out so it becomes useful as you drop away from the table, and therefore more like the other Tenergy variants."
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,"The T80 topsheet is quite a bit softer than T25, and if you add an FX sponge underneath you will be getting very far away from T25FX, with an overall sponge-rubber combination that would feel very different (and a lot softer)."
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,"It doesn't mean it would necessarily be bad, you wouldn't know without trying it, but it would most definitely be quite different than you are used to."
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,Almost certainly you would find regular T80 closer to what you are used to than T80FX.
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,I always use these things in 2.1 mm thickness.
45,5f6c29fd4272aba9ab7757ea,Tenergy 25 fx vs Tenergy 80fx,"With 1.9 the overall effect of topsheet is greater, but the same general pattern should still be true."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Funny...
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I have asked myself the same question!TTNPP sells duro 10$ cheaper than the normal hexer.. is it a flop and no one is buying it?
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,?
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Hexer Duro is a Tensor also.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I don't know why it is cheaper because it's a good rubber.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,In the package says that its topsheet is 100% natural rubber.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Sponge is yellow, porous and quite soft."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It looks like Acuda S2.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Does the Duro have the Hexer or the Hexer+ topsheet?
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,The ITTF codes are different.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Hexer and Hexer Power Sponge have the same topsheet, while Hexer+ and Hexer Duro are different."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"You're right, I had not noticed that!After talking to a few people, I hear that following are the differences:Hexer is the grippiest with the highest spin (and highest throw)."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Hexer powersponge is Hexer with a softer but powerful sponge.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,The Hexer duro has a similar topsheet to Hexer but is thicker and therefore more durable (hence the name 'duro').
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,The Hexer+ is faster than any of the other but not quite as grippy or spinny.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I read that powersponge is the gripiest and duro with the least spin abillity..Thats the info from andro.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Perhaps the softer sponge on the hexer Powersponge makes it a little spinnier than the regular Hexer, coz the surface grip shuold be the same if they have the topsheet."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I'm sure it really depends on the stroke in question.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Many people would say that T05 is spinnier than T05fx, yet on certain softish strokes the softer sponged version would help produce more spin."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"I've not used the Powersponge, but some German reviewers are saying if you dig the ball in, the orginal will produce more spin then the Powersponge.Perhaps the softer Powersponge would help with some of my sloppy strokes"
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Thanks Shoebox9, that makes sense!"
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Good to see you around again!
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Perhaps I can add to this thread having played with Original Hexer, Hexer+, Hexer Powersponge and Hexer Duro Original Hexer - I did not like this rubber."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It was too hard for me to loop with and I found the dwell time plus throw angle too low.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Everytime I looped the ball, it would go into the net and I couldn't lift the ball very easily.Hexer+ - I did like this rubber, but it was a little too fast for me."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"I found that the soft touch / close control was very good but when you really ""whacked"" the ball, it would fly off the end of the table."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"It can be a fast rubber if you want it to be, but for my looping style, it didn't suit me.Hexer Powersponge - I love this rubber!"
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It's simply one of the nicest rubbers I've ever played with.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Great for looping as it has a decent dwell time and the control is superb.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It also produce decent levels of spin and is easy to control in both the short and long game.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,The only reason I don't use this now is that my new blade doesn't work too well with it.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"To use this rubber, you really do need to be using a harder type of wood in your blade."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Balsa type blades and soft sponges don't seem to work for me.Hexer Duro - This rubber, on a balsa or soft wood type blade, is superb!"
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Again there is a fantastic level of control and the spin you can generate is really very good indeed.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It's quicker than the Powersponge version but slower than Hexer+ so it sits in the middle of both in terms of pace.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I found this rubber to be the best out of the range for close to the table control and especially looping.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"If you're a smasher, then you would probably want the Hexer+ but if you like to loop the ball, then the Duro would be my choice.As with all of the above, it does depend on the type of blade you are sticking the rubber to."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"I have found that harder blades respond better to softer sponges whereas softer blades require a medium to hard sponge on them.Whatever you use though, the Hexer range is the best of the Andro rubbers I've ever played with."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,They are all very good at passive blocking and their close to the table control is also very good.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It really depends on the type of blade you are using and whether you are a looper or a smasher Hope this helps.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Thx for the review.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It does make sense to me.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I tried to play tackifire special soft on my one ply hinoki blade..It was a disaster!
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Soft timber and soft sponge doesnt work for me either!
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Just tried a soft sponge rubber on my 7 ply hinoki today, same thing."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,grrrrr
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Thanks a lot ChrisBuer, very useful !"
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Hi,Does anyone have any information on the weight of the Hexer variants?I am particularly interested in Hexer+ and Duro.Regards,Jonathan"
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Could dig up only the Hexer(47.5deg) on Jasupo:http://www.jasupo.com/report/hexer.htmHexer+(47.5deg) should weigh the same or slightly less based on its less dense but longer pips arrangement.Hexer Duro and Powersponge(both 37.5deg), given the relatively soft sponge, should weigh much less."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,weight of my Hexer & Hexer+ are 65-66g uncut...Hexer PS is 58-59g uncut....
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I would agree with dang near everything ChrisBuer said about the Hexer+ and Duro.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I have played these two quite a bit now.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"I really like both of them very much, and both of them have their attributes to like."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I definitely thought the Hexer+ had far more dwell time than the Hexer Duro.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Despite the Duro having very quick ball contact, it has very strong spin capabilities."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,The Hexer+ has very very long ball contact.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,You can really manipulate the ball alot mid stroke.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"This is an incredible attribute for flipping, which doesn't come naturally to me, but with the Hexer+ I have great success with this stroke."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,It's much more difficult to hit good flips with the Duro cause of the short contact.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I really can't decide which is faster between + or Duro.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,They are both pretty darn fast.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"The Duro is definitely quicker, maybe not faster but definitely quicker."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Over the table both are good rubbers, but I think most rubbers work around the table as long as your strokes are correct."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Table play is a game of adjustments.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Away from the table either the rubbers have it or they don't.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,These both have it.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Do you guys think that Hexer Duro would work with a PG7?
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"(which is a pretty hard blade)Reading all the reviews, duro sounds very promising for me, medium hardness sponge, medium throw & good speed and spin."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Now I just need to know if it would work with a hard blade.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I know these are all old generation rubbers now but Ive used all four.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Power sponge is super soft has the most control but isn't very deadly, however you can loop extremely easily with it."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Hexer and hexer plus are just kind of normal rubbers, normal tensors."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"Duro was my Favorite of the four, its got a lower throw and is more stable looping at the table, very good considering its not a hard rubber."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,I've been a hexer convert for several years now.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Originally tried Hexer in 2011 but found HexerPS & Hexer+ to be better than the original.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,For some time I used HexerPS on HF and Hexer+ on BH of a YinHe T1 blade.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"This setup was very fast with lots of spin.During 2014, I wasnted to develop my short game technique so opted for slower rubber on slower blade: Cornilleau Soft Carbon with XIOM True Innovation / Hexer+."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,This worked very well and I'm sticking with it for the time being.Very recently I looked to replace the XIOM as a FH rubber and ended up going back to HexerPS.
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"However, where back in 2011, I felt the Hexer+ was noticeably faster than HexerPS, in 2015 I'm finding very little difference between these two rubbers and wondering if this is the impact of using a slower blade???."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,"I'm finding both rubbers are viable for FH or BH loops, drives, chops or blocks.I haven't tried Hexer Duro or Rasant PowerGrip as yet and thinking I may try one or both at some stage during 2015."
46,5f6c2a044272aba9ab7757ed,Hexer vs Hexer+ vs Hexer Duro,Where does Hexer HD fit in all this?
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,Tried out the Vega Elite over the past 3 days and found the following:Review XIOM Vega Elite- 2mm Red on Cornelieu Soft Carbon Off+ Blade with Hexer+Speed: 8 in short game / 6 in long game.Spin: 8 in short game / 5 in long game.Control: 7Short Distance:Was expecting emphasis on control with slow blocks but got surprised by faster bounce (possibly as ball bottomed out on the blade) resulting is less control than desired.Long Distance:Slower and lacks spin.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,Suitable for flat drives.Topspin:Average topspin game but can loop with it in short game.Chop / Push:Generates heavy chop in short game and provided good control in defensive long chop.Comparison – Vega EuropeMuch slower and less control than Vega Europe.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,"Similar spin.Comparison - Hexer +:Much slower and less control than Hexer+ and much less topspin and sidespin.Comparison – Tenergy 05fx:Less speed, spin and control.Recommendation:Might suit a defensive player better than offensive."
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,I used Vega Elite for 3 months and loved it for forehand chopping.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,"It also blocked very well, and I didn't notice any problems with it bottoming out."
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,"I would say it's high control, but at the cost of spin."
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,The lack of spin makes it great when blocking against heavy topsin.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,I also felt it was better for looping at mid distance vs. at the table.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,Too soft at longer distances but that's where I would chop or fish anyway.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,You must engage the sponge to spin well with it.
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,"Ultimately I moved on due to the lack of spin, particularly on service and loops... but for inverted blocking at the table, it was very nice."
47,5f6c2a074272aba9ab7757ef,T-05fx 2.1mm vs Xiom Vega Elite 2.0mm,"Agree with most of the above reviews,I tried this as a possible alternative to 05fx,it`s a nice rubber and at least one of the top players in my area is using it in max with the Strad but it doesn't come close for me.I found a lower throw,less spin and arc,not as good in chopping and pushing the feel is softer however it does improve with a couple of layers of Falco booster but the Tenergy still gives me more of a cutting edge in everything"

48,5f6c2a577da9e46ccbe1544f,INFORMATION XIOM VEGA ASIA VS BLUEFIRE JP01 TURBO & MORE...,42.5-45 degrees.For a stiff blade would be hesitant about anything that's rated at 47.5+ degrees & would have a preference for a higher throw rubber.TT11 have the Tibhar 5Q on offer at the moment for €36 and decathlon.es have the Tibhar 1Q & Joola Maxx 400 for €33 & €28.
48,5f6c2a577da9e46ccbe1544f,INFORMATION XIOM VEGA ASIA VS BLUEFIRE JP01 TURBO & MORE...,Coach in my old club rates / uses the 1Q high and he's using a LP on the BH.
48,5f6c2a577da9e46ccbe1544f,INFORMATION XIOM VEGA ASIA VS BLUEFIRE JP01 TURBO & MORE...,I preferred the 1Q XD over the 1Q but the XD is better back from the table.
48,5f6c2a577da9e46ccbe1544f,INFORMATION XIOM VEGA ASIA VS BLUEFIRE JP01 TURBO & MORE...,5Q has some Tenergy 05 similarities and should be good close to the table if you could control it.Also worthwhile checking out the Joola Maxx-p & Rhyzm-P which are supposedly designed for the poly ball.
48,5f6c2a577da9e46ccbe1544f,INFORMATION XIOM VEGA ASIA VS BLUEFIRE JP01 TURBO & MORE...,There's also the 5Q VIP rated at 42.5 degrees.
48,5f6c2a577da9e46ccbe1544f,INFORMATION XIOM VEGA ASIA VS BLUEFIRE JP01 TURBO & MORE...,Have not tried any of those.If I had to pick one probably opt for the 1Q for the celluloid ball on a modern defender setup.http://www.decathlon.es/joola-revestimiento-maxxx-400-id_8319455.htmlhttp://www.decathlon.es/w-tibhar-rvt-1q-id_8288789.htmlhttp://www.tabletennis11.com/eur_eng/ti ...

49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,If anyone can translate this we will know more:Der VS > 402 Double Extra ist die logische Weiterentwicklung des sehr beliebten VS > 401.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Hierzu wurde das sehr griffige, elastische Obergummi mit einem modernen, etwas härteren Offensivschwamm kombiniert."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Durch diese neuartige Schwamm-Obergummi-Kombination ist dieser High Energy Tension-Belag die ideale Waffe für alle spinorientierten Allrounder.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Das extrem griffige und flexible Obergummi greift den Ball förmlich und sorgt dadurch für eine fantastische Rotationsentwicklung, sowohl bei eigenen Topspinbällen als auch bei stark unterschnittenen Abwehrbällen."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Der optimierte Offensivschwamm des VS > 402 Double Extra bewirkt im Vergleich zum VS > 401 noch mehr Dynamik, was besonders bei eigenen Topspinbällen ein großer Vorteil ist."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Trotz dieses zusätzlichen Tempogewinns lassen sich auch weiterhin sehr kontrollierte und gleichzeitig gefährliche Unterschnittvarianten erzeugen.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I keep the exact translation for the german native speakers, but in short: it's the successor of the Victas VS > 401."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The sponge is harder than the one of the 401 and the topsheet is very grippy and very flexible.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It's more dynamic in topspin play, while keeping backspin play very controlled and strong.I might consider this rubber."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The Victas VS>402 looks very interesting  If it's anywhere as good as the 401 which I'm using on my FH of one of my Re-Impact Barath's it will be impressive.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Nice summary.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"A more dynamic VS>401 for allround spin oriented play.I also read it will be in 1,8, 2,0 and 2,3 mm."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The VS>402 Double Extra is the logical development of the very popular VS>401.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Therefore the very grippy and elastic topsheet was combined with a modern and a little bit harder offensive sponge.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Due to this new sponge-topsheet combination this High Energy Tension-rubber is the weapon of choice for spinoriented allrounders.The extream grippy and flexible topsheet litterally grips the ball and creates fantastic spin, on own topspin strokes as well as on heavy underspin chops."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The optimized offensive sponge of the VS>402 Double Extra gives in relation to the VS>401 even more dynamic, wich is a advantage especially on topspin strokes."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But despite the gain in speed, you can still play very controlled and dangerous backspin balls.So from what i read, it is the VS>401 topsheet with a harder sponge, probably a ESN sponge with more Tension then the VS>401 had."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Could be for players who thougt the VS>401 to slow, but Tenergy, Evolution, Bluefire,... to fast."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Maybe an option for players with chinese rubbers on their forehand that look for more dynamic.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Kind Regards
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The sponge on the 401 is already quite firm, so I'm not sure if I'd like it harder."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 401 topsheet is great though, soft and very elastic and VERY spinny!"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Thanx.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I saw it at contra.de in these thicknesses, indeed."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,For you there might be this:The VS>402 Limber ist the softest version of the grippy Victas VS-Series.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The grippy and elastic Topsheet is combined with the catapultic(bouncy) Limber-offensive sponge, which created a whole new feeling(feedback)."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The new 40°-Sponge gives this High Energy Tension rubber an incredible control in the offensive game as well as a great sound.With the very grippy topsheet you can put pressure onto your opponent with a dangerous serve/return game and high rotation spins.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,This unique sponge-topsheet-combination gives a new dimension of fun into a diverse Allround game.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Kind Regards
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"You're right, that sounds perfect for me!"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Me too
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I heard from Victas that the 402 will be released around June this year.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Any more news on this?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Lars at Japsko said it was supposed to be available at the end of June.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,At Contra.de they says: Product is not on stock and will be delivered around 21.07.2014.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I am really curious about the Double extra version, will try it in 1,8 I thinkt, since I really need to make my bat a little lighter..."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I just heard from Japsko that the rubber is delayed to mid august because they are waiting for some kind of decision or approvement from ITTF
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Gollum, I see you use both the V>401 and V>01Limbre."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Which of the 2 do you prefer on your Barath?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,both versions of the vs>402 are now available at tt-japan.net and iruiru.com.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I am tempted....
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,You have my blessing
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,according to Victas' website (http://www.victas-jp.com/home/rubberIn.html)VS>401 : 57.5VS>402double extra: 50VS>402Limber: 40
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Wow, thanks fazer227!"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Now I'm definitely interested, although I find it hard to imagine a better rubber than the 401 for my game."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I am sooo eager to try 402 double in 1,8 mm."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I think that will be perfect for me.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I really like 401 but it is too heavy.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I have tried it in 1,5 but 1,8 would have been better..."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I choosed 1,5 to be sure to make my bat lighter (my elbow hurts a little)."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I was tempted to try the 401 for its spin but isn't it very heavy, very hard and slow.How would it compare on those parameters to Hurricane2/3.The 402 Limber looks more interesting...."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I was trying to find something like Grips-S Euro Soft which is no longer available from Tibhar.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Could this play similar?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 401 is fairly heavy (similar to something like T05), and the sponge quite firm."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"However the sponge is powerful, far more powerful than any Chinese rubber, including Hurricane."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"When you brush the ball mainly with the topsheet, it's extremly spinny and not too disimilar to a Chinese rubber, but once you dig the ball into the sponge it's powerful and fast, similar to something like T05.Hurricane topsheet is harder, so you'll get considerable less spin for slow brush loops, but similar spin at medium to fast loops.The 401 is also really good for blocking."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"My blocking has always been a weakness, but it's really improved since I changed from 999 turbo to 401."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 401 is much less sensitive to spin compared to most Chinese rubbers, and feels very direct and accurate."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I suspect the really short pimples (on the inside) provide this.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I think I'm reading contradicting things about the sponge of 402 Double Extra.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The description from early in this thread said 402 would be like 401 with a harder, more offensive sponge."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Now these measurements show 401 to have a much harder sponge than 402 Double Extra.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,What's the deal?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Anybody know?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I think it was a misleading translation that caused a misunderstanding.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"According to Victas website vs 401 is at 57, vs 402 double extra at 50 and Limber at 40 degrees."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"As I have given the translation, maybe I can clarify.In the german description from Victas, they have said: ""Hierzu wurde das sehr griffige, elastische Obergummi mit einem modernen, etwas härteren Offensivschwamm kombiniert."""
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"which I have translated as "" Therefore the very grippy and elastic topsheet was combined with a modern and a little bit harder offensive sponge."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"""I think the problam was the ""...a modern and a little bit harder..."" which leads to the understandig, that the sponge is in relation to the old sponge modern and a little bit harder."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But the meaning seems to be, that the sponge is a modern, a bit harder offensive sponge, which is in relation to the class of offensive sponges."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But to be honest, I also understood it like the new sponge would be harder then the old one."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Kind Regards
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Thanks struppi, that makes sense!"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Is 57.5 one of the hardest sponges of all rubbers on the market?I wonder how the Limber would play at 40 ?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Yes it's quite firm, still softer than many Chinese rubbers though."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It does not feel so hard though, probably because the topsheet is quite soft."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The sponge also softens up a little after a few sessions.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,sounds very interestingpl.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,name some websites that i can purchase Victas rubberThanks a lot
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Buy Victas rubbers on http://www.tabletennis11.com/other_eng/ ... _nfxrWx5zM
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Has anyone bought this rubber yet?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Is it really available?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Sure..
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I got one from Japan.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I added the weight and measurements to the rubber mass database.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I only used it for a few minutes and put it away because I was practicing with a better player and didn't want to waste his time with the mistakes I was making with it.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,My completely meaningless quick impression was that it felt like an ESN rubber that didn't wow me right away.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Said better player's meaningless two second impression was that it felt like Acuda.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I don't sense any tackiness really.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The Limber is a touch soft for me, I might like a 42.5 or 45 more."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I might post more thoughts when I actually give it a real try but I don't really like to talk about equipment anymore unless I have a lot of sessions under my belt with it.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I may or may not ever get that far as T05FX1.9 has been working out surprisingly well for me of late.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Thanx.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,You are right about it is better to try a rubbber a little more before reviewing it.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I suppose you only got the Limber version?Has anyone bought the Double Extra version?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I should be getting some samples any day now.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I will check them out and will be happy to share them around...
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I have asked Lars at Japsko to send me a black 1,8 mm Double Extra as soon as he has it."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,He has the Limber already so the DE should be there soon I hope.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"For now I use VS 401 1,5 mm."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Feels ok but I would like a little softer, thicker and more speed."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But I love the top sheet when fresh, sooo much spin."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The Limber is released before the Double Extra, so this is why shops will have the Limber first."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"We won't be able to get Double Extra Till Sept, but it may be different for other regions."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Have you heard of any specific reason for why Double Extra is being delayed?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,According to Japsko there were some delays with the approving process by ITTF.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Yes I heard that too, but I pointed out to them that it's already on the ITTF approved list now, so I think there was a misc-ommunication."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The new Victas 402 DE caught my attention when I decided to revert to inverted rubber on my BH, and I obtained a 1.8 red."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It arrived three days ago, and I tried on my Re impact Barrath and Andro Supreme Kinetic all+."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"As it was only my first two sessions of about six hours playing, my opinion most probly isn't objective enough."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Also bear in mind my description below refer to my BH strokes only.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It comprises of, as described in this thread, a firm but not too hard sponge."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The top sheet is soft and elastic.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,It proves to be an excellent device in many departments of my style of game.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Speed and control.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Normally these elements are contradicting to one another.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But his rubber provides fast catapult effect, and the ball can be returned in great preciseness."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"IMO, this is achieved by the good combination of sponge and top sheet."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I always have difficulties with Barath in blocking.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,No problem at all with Vic >402 DE on.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Those attacks that usually are blocked high away by me are now nicely done.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Real satisfaction.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"If my blocks are hit back to me with more power, my follow up blocks explode like mighty cannon and with greater speed, as the ball just bounces back with the incoming force."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Leaving my opponent only to watch the ball fly pass him(a district level experienced player).In power brush looping from mid distance, the trajactory is medium flat and packed with SPEED, POWER AND SPINNNNNNNNNNNN!"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"My mates are surprised at the change in this aspect.Opening drive is the only area where I encountered shortcoming of this rubber, probly due to my skill."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I find it difficult to open up a serve via BH driving.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"If I side swope or light hit, the result are much better.Perhaps the best area of this rubber is hitting."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It is like effortless, even under pressure."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,You may hit hard and the rubber releases that similar great power with speed.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Or you just lazily hit, and the ball can be placed anywhere according to your wish."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"My, it is real joy!I tried to chop back hard looping balls."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Almost all my chops go back are low, straight and easily done."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,They are not that deadly as I chop with lp though.I don't have the opportunity to play more with it.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,But I hope my little experience with this rubber may provide sort of reference to those interested.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Thank you jixiaolan kc, that's great to hear!I don't know if you've tried the 401, but it does sound very similar in the aspects you've outlines, which is great to hear as it's been my favourite rubber for my FH."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"@ Haggisv, From the information provided by this thread, 401 1.5 mm might be another great rubber for me too."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I reckon slightly thinner 401 1.5 mm may give better control for me, especially when using the Barath which itself possesses high catapult strength."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Too bad 402 DE thinnest is 1.8 mm.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I agree with you and should try the 401 1.5 mm.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Probably some time in next October when I go Adelaide again, where my new KVM blade is awaiting for me."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I would be great if we can catch up this time jixiaolan kc!
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Interesting, I had not realised that the 402 was not made in 1.5mm"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I wish that too.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Just that these 4 years has taken its toll on my physical strength.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Hmmm... hard to meet up to your deadly BH lp game that I was told at Newton.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I use 401 in 1,5 for now."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I had it in 2,0 for 8 months before (not much grip left)."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It is a rather big step from 2,0 to 1,5 I have to say."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Blocks and loops tend to go low, and the thinner rubber feels less forgiving when attacking."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,But chopping is sooo easy
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Yes I was also surprised at the difference between 1.5mm and 2.0mm...quite dramatic.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,The 1.8mm was the perfect compromise.PS Def-attack: Do you also find that the 401 sponge softens up a lot in the first few weeks?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I've not come a across a rubber that softens that much.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I quite like this actually.... it does not seem to affect my play much, I just like the feel better after a few weeks."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,LOL!
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Perhaps a coffee would be a better option if you prefer....
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I'm buying!
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Actually, when I broke my 2.0 in I never noticed that it changed much."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But I did start a little slow with it, a few minutes at the time, and I had that blade (vs 401 and a lp on a VKM) for 2 months evaluating it before I gave up my Joo Se Hyuk with Thors."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,So I really can't tell.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"My 1,5 mm has the same history, I changed to it while waiting for 402 DE, but after two sessions I changed back to 2,0 mm."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Then I realised my blade had a crack and I had to change to a new VKM and then I mounted the 1,5 mm again."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I have had 2 sessions with my new blade and it felt nice.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"But it could be that the blade is a new (without a crack) and that it has nothing to so with the rubber, I really can't tell..."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Haggisv:LOL!
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Perhaps a coffee would be a better option if you prefer....
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I'm buying!
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Haha, that is definitely the better option."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I know of a fantastic place for such kind of ""meet up"" at Norwood."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,LOL
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Def-attack wrote:I use 401 in 1,5 for now."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I had it in 2,0 for 8 months before (not much grip left)."

49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,But chopping is sooo easy Sounds like to me I should stick on to 1.8mm.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I will be playing with KVM too.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"From your experience, is this blade combines well with 1.8mm Vic >401?"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,In terms of blocking and looping?I have these nice medium arching in my returned blocks against hard drives/looping.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The returns are quite disruptive, giving opponents anti rubber like effect with 402 DE on Andro Kinetic A+."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,How is the block return with 401 1.8mm on VKM?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I haven't tried it in 1,8 but blocking should be fine."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Any more news on 402 Double Extra?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I've only got a sample in 2.0mm red.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I can send it to you (free) if you want to try it and review it.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,PM me if you're interested.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Thanks for the offer.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,But I just tried 402 Limber and I realised that the top sheet was not the same as on 401 .
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 402 had a lot less spin, but that could be because of the bounciness of the sponge."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,It is a nice rubber though...
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 1,8 mm had a loud pop-sound when I looped and hit the sweet spot."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,But it just doesn't suit my game.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I am afrAid it won't suit my game even with a harder sponge.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Also, the soft sponge of the Limber-version might suit the soft VKM a little less good than for example a Joo Se Hyuk-blade."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I had it on för 30minutes, then I changed back to 401 1,5 mm."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I might settle for 402 1,8 mm later."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"When I decided to try the >402 DE, there was a worry in my mind."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Two years ago, I bought a Donic M2."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,It turned out a disappointment not because of poor quality.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Rather I had frustrating problem of gluing it to my blade.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I tried both Haifu BW 2 glue and VOC free.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,It just would not stick on blade.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Later I learned the big pores sponge was the issue.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 402 DE has no such problem at all, as its spore is not the big type?!"
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Is this true?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I wish to try the 401 version I hope it turns out great in the gluing perspective as well as the playing characteristics.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I am quite sure of the latter as this forum provided confidence of this rubber.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,As about the gluing part I am unsure.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Those who have experienced with it advise please.Thank you.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I had no problem gluing VS401 to a sealed blade, using Donic formula glue."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"As I play more games with 402DE, the more I discovered its strength in various perspectives.This rubber ""covered up"" my weakness in TT."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Sluggishness sets into my movement as my physical strength dwindles.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,This was most obvious since a year ago.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,One of my TT mates is very good in changing his wrist work at the last second.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Returning my first FH lp chopping against his hard FH looping to my FH, then he would, during his second or third looping, opens his blade and loop straight down to my BH."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I wasn't able to move in in time for this.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I tend to hit/block them long at that last moment.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,402 DE makes thing easier for me.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Somehow I am able to block the ball to his BH pressuring him to either block off table or a weak return for me hitting.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I know it is not my game has improved, because this change comes soon after I started playing 402 DE."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"The 401 blocks really well, and seems quite accurate."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Sounds like the 402 shares this characteristics.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"If it does not have gluing problem and blocks well, hmmm it should be a good rubber for player like me."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Thank you for your opinion.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Appreciate.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Any more news on VS<402 Double Extra?
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,I tried the Limber version and it was far too bouncy for me.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,But the main reason I didn't like it was that it wasn't as grippy as VS <401.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Actually it was quite a difference.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I wonder if this only was because of the bouncyness, because I never broke it in (only tried it for one hour before I gave it to my friend who needed a new BH rubber).I am about to make myself a new bat for plastic ball and I am wondering if I should go for 401 2,0 mm on BH or 402 Double extra 2,0 mm on BH."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I use 401 1,8 mm now and that works ok with cell-ball but a faster one would be nice."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Doulbe Extra 1,8 mm would also be an option if there is a big difference in speed between 401 and 404 DE."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Any feedback is welcome.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I just had a look at the latest larc document, for some reason the victas 402 is listed as only being approved until the end of 2014."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"True, but the Victas > 402 Limber and Victas > 402 Double Extra are being kept valid."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Those are the only Victas > 402 rubbers.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"After playing 402 DE on VKM for three weeks, I decided to switch back to RE-Impact Barat."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"I dont mean it did not work out on VKM, but the dead feeling is what I dont like."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Probably I have been seasoned with Barat!
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Once again, the liveliness of DE springs back into the action."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Then I received 401 1.8mm.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Immediately I put it on the same blade, replacing the 402 DE."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"As I advance into third week of action with 401, it is certain that the control is even better."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"It allows me to maneuver at near table with greater ease, probably due to slightly firmer top sheet."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"While DE requires less effort in every strokes, 401 provides a little slower(in comparison to DE only) but steadier games."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"However, to me, 402 DE is excellent in underspin pushing both long and short balls, generating weird anti like returns."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Other than that, these two rubbers work out fine for me on Barat."
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,Sorry fazer227 to take so long to reply but have only just read your query.
49,5f6c2a627da9e46ccbe15454,New Victas VS>402,"Using the Barath I prefer the Victas > 401 but I’m now using the Re-Impact Smart & have tried the Victas > 401 which is good but I find the Victas > 402 limber better, I'm very impressed with this set up (more so than the Barath), more control & spin with great power when required with this blade/rubber combination."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy," Let me start this off by saying, yes."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,This makes a world of difference.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"No I'm not referring to the price, the adequacy, or the effectiveness."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"But as far as differences go, Omega V pro vs Tenergy 05 are about as different as you can get in my opinion."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Also, I've never used T64 extensively, so I can't compare it to Omega V Tour.By the way, before I can make any advice or comments I give on these rubbers helpful to you, I'll have to know your approximate USATT rating."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Anyway, like I've said and will say."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,It all depends on your game.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"The Tenergy 05 rubber is something I'll recommend to few people, in spite of the fact that it's one of the best rubbers I've ever used."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Here's why: -It's very sensitive to spin; the serves are great, but good iuck receiving spin you're unsure about."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,To continue on that: -It's incredibly bouncy in the short game.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"So much so that if you dont absolutely know how to receive serves at your own rating level, T05 will doom you before you get your chance to fatally loop drive them off the table."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"-The throw is so high, that if you don't know what you're doing, you will do either A) always loop long off the table on power loops, or B) get used to adjusting your racket angle so closed for powerloops that any time you have to loop a basic dead ball you'll throw it right into the net."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"The pros of T05 however are: -Extreme, serious looping ability!"
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Let me stress, you must know how to loop."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"When I say loop, I don't mean ""how to topspin""."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"I mean, know how to loop any variant of underspin, dead ball, or counterdrive any level of topspin."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"But if you're cut out to do that, I'll be damned if I can personally find a better rubber for sheer looping prowess."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,-Your serves will simply murder folks (who are at least 100 lower than your rating.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"If you seriously think your serves keep your rating 100 or 200 points higher than the rest of your game, that really means that you need to work more on your game, not that you're a talented server."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Believe me, I've learned this the hard way, moving up the ranks)."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"HOWEVER, even against folks you're on equal footing with, the extra spin on serves can be a bonus GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW how to vary subtly between no spin, slight spin, slightly more spin, and heavy spin."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"coming to Omega V pro: first let me say, what an amazing rubber."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Its the PERFECT sponge hardness if you ask me (a little harder than Tenergy) yet more than welcomely less bouncy.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"I know I may get flamed for saying this, but it's sliightly comparable to Chinese rubbers in that the blocks and short game are sloow, yet power loops/loop drives/counter drives go at a bullet pace provided you have the arm strength."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"In my opinion much better for opening loop followed by hard drive, as compared to Tenergy."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"(the hugest difference as compared to Chinese rubbers is obviously is that it doesn't have the sheer tack of Chinese rubbers; that in mind, the throw angle will not increase with arm speed; I need not tell you that Euro/Jap rubbers and Chinese rubbers require an entirely different mentality and stroke."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Right?)
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Reasons why I would not recommend it to folks: When I say this, I say this for real: Do not get a remotely hard sponged rubber if you aren't prepared to use it (keep in mind, this is much less hard than good Chinese rubbers!)"
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Trust me; I'm in my physical prime being a healthy 26 year old man who works out regularly.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"That said, it took me 2 years of hard practice, to be able to comprehend why hard sponged rubbers are better."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"They are non-ideal for learning stroke, being that they're less forgiving."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"but if you are confident enough in your stroke, the harder sponges help reward your confidence with greater spin and forward force."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,They don't reward hesitation!
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"In fact, they punish it."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"HOWEVER: In this particular, rarity of a case only applicable to a comparison with T05, the Omega V pro is still more controllable, given that it's much deader and less bouncy on soft shots, and moreover has a less volatile topsheet (by which I mean remarkably spin sensitive) and will allow you to slightly misread the amount of spin but still get a weak return to land on the table."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Reasons why I would recommend the Omega V pro: -The hard sponge mixed with CONFIDENT loop drives; it'll turn you into a murderer.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,-Should I mention the confidence again?
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,CRUCIAL.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"If you're confident, this won't stop you."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,- If you have no problems lifting underspin.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,I remember starting off with Baracuda or T05 and thinking nothing of underspin.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Okay guys; yeah you have to start under the table with this rubber.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"But hey, get those feet moving and live a little, and you'll find yourself getting used to the lower throw vs underspin while at the same time pounding on those loops and drives from your opponents; with ease."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"If you aren't at least over 1800 USATT, hoenstly don't bother with this."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Try a softer rubber to learn the stroke first.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"(Unless you attempt to play with the full chinese arm stroke, in which case I can't help you there) - Serving is B****ing!"
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Well.. not as great as T05 BUT: my left handed He Zhi Wen style fast heavy side/topspin to the midrange edge murders folk, and my wristy side/backspin fools 2000+ players into the net."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Yeah; you'll get some spin out of this.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"-Counterlooping: I must say, this rivals if not slightly (but hey, I only mean slightly) exceeds T05 at this."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"With T05, if you really, really, and I mean absotively posolutely know what you're doing, you'll make some killer counterloops."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"But with the Omega V pro, all it takes is the rash mind of a relatively young person combined with some intellect for spin, and the will to destroy, and you'll be banging your opponents loops down into oblivion."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,The comparative lack of bounciness along with the relative hardness of the sponge plays in big there.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,I hope I've covered something with that?
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Let me know if I was incomplete in any area and I'll try to supplement.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"Wow!Thank's Beta, I would have to reed this more then once  I don't live in the States so I'm not rated, but nevertheless, I play recreational tt with some serious competition players.Currently I do play with XIOM setup and was tempted to go for Tenergy."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,After your reply it seems to me its not the right time yet.I use Pro rubber in max.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"so maybe its better, when I change rubbers ( same Omega Pro/Tour), to go for 2.0 instead.Thank's again!"
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,You're quite right about that.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,One thing I feel I may have neglected to mention is the importance of sponge thickness.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,How far away from the table do you absolutely need to go to facilitate you power shots?
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"If you're a hardcore looper who gravitates toward 3+feet-away-from-table power loops, then max sponge would benefit you."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,"If you even more than 50% of the time stay close in to the table, 2.0 is more than acceptable.. in fact, max sponge will hinder your close-to-the-table game quite a bit more than it will benefit your loops."
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,I'm definitely more for 2.0 thickness.Supposedly it will give me more control and ability to generate spin.
50,5f6c2a637da9e46ccbe15455,XIOM vs Tenergy,Great comparison Beta!
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I have tried all three rubbers that you mentioned.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Xiom OVT is much harder than T05FX and regular T05 for that matter.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,It is also a bit faster than both.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I think it offers similar control though.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,T05FX is more likely to offer more control and a bit less speed.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I really like Xiom Vega Japan as an alternative.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I use it in 2.0mm.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,ckhirnigs did you try Tenergy 05 on the Defplay?
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,this is something Ihave been considering as sometimes the attacks with 05 fx don`t penetrate enough for me although generally I like it for everythig else
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I actually haven't tried T05 on my Defplay.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I have only tried T05FX briefly on the Defplay.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I am actually in the same boat as you.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I am thinking about trying a sheet of Tenergy on my Defplay.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I can't decide between T05 or T64.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I'm also having difficulty deciding on sponge thickness.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I'm going back and forth between 1.7mm and 1.9mm.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Your comment makes me think I will probably avoid the FX sponge versions.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"To help the OP, I thought the Xiom OVT was a bit too hard on my Defplay for the modern defensive style I play."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I think I like Vega Japan better because the feel is medium.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,It feels good for offensive strokes as well as defensive.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I'm trying to figure out which Tenergy will have the same attributes.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"I feel like T64 is more popular for defense, but I suppose it all comes down to preference."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I chose XIOM OVT because of this notes in tabletenisdb site.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,take a look: Rubber..............................Speed.................
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,​​Spin ................Control Xiom Omega Tour V ............9.0 .....................9.3 .................9.3 Butterfly Tenergy 05 FX .......9.1 .....................9.2 .................8.9 Xiom Vega Japan ................8.6 .....................8.3 ..................8.5 Are these numbers false?
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"What is your score for the XIOM OVT?Vega japan is little slower, but in this score, have much less spin and control"
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Those numbers are based on numbers supplied by contributors of the db site, who may or may not have any clue what they're talking about, so don't take them as gospel."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,The Vega Japan is a VERY spinny rubber.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Most of the higher end rubber from non-chinese brands other than butterfly are made by ESN (germany).
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"They basically make the same base product with minor variations on softness/tack/pip-geometry, etc."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,ESN rubbers are ~90% of Tenergy for somewhat less money (but I think last somewhat shorter depending on how much the topsheet tension is) so that's a value decision you'll have to make yourself.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Money is not the problemI'm using Tenergy 05.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Spin is great, but I want more control and less speed.I read that Tenergy 05FX have more control and less speed than T 05, but it's not significative differenceThen I chose XIOM OVT because of the reviews in tabletennisdbBut I'm open to other optionsI need help"
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,You don't have control over Tenergy (or any other fast rubber) because you don't have the professional game it's formulated for.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,This isn't a problem what can be solved by buying something.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Vey true.I think t05 fx is probably what you are after.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Just a remark about these types of threads in general.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Small tweaks are not going to make any tangible difference unless you're either high level, or have some technical flaw* in which case it reveals another type of problem."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,A softer sponge is maybe 5-10% difference.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"I seriously doubt that a control issue anyone can readily observe and willing to admit is a case of the former, and for the latter a meager 5-10% isn't going to matter."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Sure a 5-10% slower tenergy is going to be better control, but anything 5-10% slower is better control, and anything 20% slower is even better control."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"If we're being technical here, with something like a very slow Koji Matsushita defensive it's possible (and advisable) to open the blade a bit & more fwd stroked topspins so a softer sponge is not going to encourage faster swings useful to attacking from longer range."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,People usually use softer sponge on more upward traditional euro loops (enables a bit higher throw with low-grip rubbers to make the methodology less flawed).
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Then again the OP might have that kind of stroke but who knows.edit:* A common example of this are players overdrilled on a certain stroke, esp power strokes, know to how to perform it by rote (going through the motions) but not by feel."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,This result in a lack of understanding and inflexibility as a result.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"If they get used to doing it with a certain type of rubber (like a T05 before it deadens) then whatever happens along that restores or ""enhances"" the original parameters is going get full marks and anything different that requires some adjustment gets marks off."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,This has nothing to do with equipment but rather themselves.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Vega japan is just as spinny, but just as fast too."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Donic Baracuda might be option... this is very spinny but a step definitely slower.Choosing a thinner sponge will also give you more control over most of your strokes, especially for the short game and chopping."
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,What about donic bluefire?http://www.tabletennisdb.com/top-rubber ... -desc.html

52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,I'm going back and forth between 1.7mm and 1.9mm.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,Your comment makes me think I will probably avoid the FX sponge versions.
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Your more in the same boat than you realise I too was pondering between t05 and t64 but in a 1.9 thickness,Ihave tried t05fx in 1.7 thickness and whilst it chopped and pushed better, if topspin/loop is your game 1.9 is much better and suspect it will be the same for t05 and t64"
52,5f6c2a847da9e46ccbe15466,Tenergy 05FX vs XIOM Omega 5 Tour,"Well that table seems like complete rubbish to me...mixing up defensive and offensive rubber... it's completely useful.... not surprising as control is very hard to define, and different for every stroke, level and individual."
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,"I have used Vega Europe, Omega IV Europe and Omgea IV Pro."
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,I liked Vega Europe but it does bottom out in strong loop to loop rallies.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,I didn't mind Omega IV Pro but the sponge is a little hard for my tastes.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,"I currently use Omega IV Europe and find it ideal - softish but not too soft, and quite elastic."
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,Given what you write I would imagine Omega IV could be what you are after.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,"Cheers mate, I'll give the O4E a go then"
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,I haven't switched to a softer FH rubber & I haven't tried O4E or even the O4 Pro rubber.What I have tried is the Vega Pro and Vega Europe and the VP was very nice but didn't think much of the VE even on the BH finding it a bit low throw.Quite a difference in hardness between a O4 Pro and a O4E at 47.5 degree compared with 42.5 degree particularly on the FH which is in the Tenergy FX hardness category.One rubber worth considering is the Vega Japan at 45 degrees.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,I haven't tried it and it's reputed to be quite similar to a T05.Top sheet is supposedly a little soft and is priced at Vega money.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,Might be worth looking into for the FH but I haven't tried it.The other Xiom rubber at 45 degrees is the Sigma II Europe which is slightly lighter and slightly lower throw than Vega Japan.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,Discounted on saletabletennis at a reasonable €28.50 when this rubber is normally €40 at my local supplier.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,Again I haven't tried it.
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,"I really like Vega Japan, but to be fair I haven't tried any other Xiom offerings except Omega V Tour (which I found a little too hard)."
53,5f6c2a857da9e46ccbe15467,Omega 4 Pro vs Euro,"I find Vega Japan perfectly medium in feel, not too soft and not too hard."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,The original M series is spinny and lively.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Dwell is good, but the whole package (topsheet and sponge) is quite reactive to spin and incoming speed."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"They are aggressive, great performance, high throw."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,Smell very strongly of booster.The first two in the JP series (JP01 and JP03) were quite different.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Sponges were less porous (well, smaller pores anyway), topsheets softer, no smell of booster."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,They both have a slight numb feeling in slower shots - a damping effect.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,Far less bouncy than the M series.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Topsheets are very elastic, so you get a great feeling of a kick in spin and speed with faster strokes."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,Medium/Low throw.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,More linear than M series.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Softer topsheets and different sponge give a smoother, softer feel than the Ms.Recent Bluefire releases I've tried have been a bit of a departure from the above (note - I haven't tried M1 Turbo)."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"JP01 Turbo seemed to have the JP01 topsheet on a different sponge, which to me looks like the M1 sponge (big pores) - but no booster smell though."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"I initially loved JP01T, but after a few sessions I felt it played a little strange."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"It was high spin, surprisingly low throw, but the speed was difficult to judge."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"It went from slow to epic speed, and I couldn't get used to the gears."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Might be my blade, obviously.And I've tried JP02 in the past few weeks, which isn't actually a middleman between JP01 and JP03."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"It's more like JP01 Turbo in that it looks like the JP topsheet, but on a softer version of the JP01 Turbo sponge."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,So it's more like JP01 Turbo Soft.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,I like JP02 more than JP01 Turbo at this stage.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"It's plenty quick, but seems more predictable than JP01 Turbo to me."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Still medium/low throw.I use JP03 on my BH side, and I used to use M3/M2 on the FH side, but everyone's needs vary of course."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,I prefer the lower throw of the JP series on my BH side.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,I'm not a fan of high throw BH rubbers.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"They're all good rubbers, but I think some of the more recent ESN releases have incredibly good grip on the topsheets (Omega V, Rasant Grip) and have passed the Bluefires for outright performance IMO, especially for my FH needs."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Wow, what a great summary, thank you so much AndySmith!"
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,What a bewildering choice of rubbers in the Bluefire series.If one was looking for a high throw rubber on the FH (45-47.5 degree) and a medium throw rubber on the BH (40-42.5 degree) which ones would be deemed to be the 'safe' choice in the Bluefire series ?
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Since you've specified the sponge hardnesses, you've made it easy!"
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,High throw - M1/M2.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"I'd go M2, because M1 is a full-on nutcase, and I'm just not good enough."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"If you're technically great with good technique, M1 is a monster."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,M2 is a safer bet.Low throw - JP03 is the only medium/low throw Bluefire with a soft sponge (42.5).
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"M3 is soft, but has a huge throw for cartoon-arc loops.Again, I haven't tried M1 Turbo, so I can't comment on how that might fit your hard/high throw requirement."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Since the M2 is regarded as the closest to T05 from the M-series, which one of the JP series would be the closest to T05?"
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,None of the JP range is like 05 really.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"If you had me at gunpoint,I'd say JP 01."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,But that's just the closest of the bunch.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,It's still quite different.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"Hi Andy,I have just started using M2 on my forehand."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,I am using it on a kiso hinoki all round plus blade.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,You describe the rubber as high throw.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,I hit my forehands pretty flat.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,Do I need to adjust my stroke or will the throw of the rubber give me a higher arc if I play my normal stroke?Bulldog.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,Are any of the JP series similar to Tenergy 64 in max ?Looking for similar blocking and counter-topspin bat angles as T64 for a BH rubber with equal or lighter weight.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,Don't want to lose too much speed either.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,T64 is good for block and counter spin on BH plus over table pickup bu not finding recent sheets as durable or consistent though.Thanks
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"M series definitely have firmer sponge, they are quicker."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,M1 and it's turbo orient are medium sponge and fast.
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,"M2 is a great backhand rubber.JP series are softer and more focused on touch and control, superb feeling and spin capabilities with good speed as a backup."
54,5f6c2a897da9e46ccbe15469,Bluefire M vs JP series differences?,They are better for maximising dwell time on the ball.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,I picked up a fairly new secondhand sheet from a club member - joola 400 in black in max and put it on a xiom zetra quad.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,Played were nice and suited the stiff blade on the backhand.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,The guy I bought it off didn't like it on his ebonholz V preferring the joola xplode sensitive which despite being an older rubber was more expensive at €35 compared with the joola 400 at €33.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,Guy who is using the XZQ loves the 400 on his BH and it has made a significant difference on his standard of play.I was surprised at the cut weight of the 400 - it was 45 grams (came off a TB ALC) - I had read somewhere that the 400 was light compared to the 450 & 500.I would be curious to hear feedback on the joola 450 which is supposedly the pick of the series for the FH.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,I played the maxxx 500 on the flame extreme.The flame extreme is comparable to the BTY Amultart in speed.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"(Very,very fast)Maxxx500 has a higher arc relative to tenergy 64.It generates huge amounts of rotation and looping underspin is easy."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"However, hitting and punching on backhand (which is what i personally do) is not as good as it would be with rhyzm.Essentially, rhyzm and Maxxx 500 are brother and sister rubbers; rhyzm hits and maxxx 500 spins.Both do generate good pace, however.What specific tensor do you want me to compare it to?"
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,I've been using Maxx 400 and Rhyzm 425 for the past few weeks - testing BH rubbers on two Rossi Emotion blades.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"I have to agree with the above comparison - Rhyzm is solid, punchy, stable."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"Maxx is elastic, highly spinny, big arc, more sensitive to incoming spin."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"I can produce really good spin from BH loops with Maxx, but it feels less precise than Rhyzm when blocking, hitting."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,I prefer Rhyzm at this stage.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"Incidentally, how alike (or non-alike) are Tensors in general?"
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,Is there a large range in properties?
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"Any specially for chopping, for instance?"
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"Or blocking, or whatever?"
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,Or are they all slight variations on the same theme?Iskandar
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"In any given generation, there are outliers, and there are variations on the same theme."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,There are also some throwbacks to older generations.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"It's a mixed bag.For example, the Bluefire M series, the original Rasant, Evolution, Vega Japan rubbers were all quite similar (noticeable that these all use a smelly factory booster)."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,Victas 401 was very different though.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,Bluefire JP arrived.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,JP03 was very similar to Rasant Powersponge.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"I didn't try Rasant Turbo, but I guess it might share a lot with JP01.Then I tried Xiom Omega V, which is similar to Rasant Grip.And then Joola Maxx arrived, and that smells of the same booster that the original Bluefire M series used, and I was surprised that this was still being used (Bluefire M used it, but JP didn't)."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"It could be that Maxx uses a new-gen topsheet but old-gen sponge I suppose.So, there are some tensors which feel specialised (the Victas ones are good examples, IMO."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"Xiom Tau is tacky, which isn't the norm)."
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,But mostly they are general euro offensive rubbers.
55,5f6c2aae7da9e46ccbe1547f,Joola Maxxx vs other Tensors,"You pick based on sponge hardness, speed, throw, topsheet grip and elasticity based on your needs."
56,5f6c2aaf7da9e46ccbe15480,Victas VS-401 revisited after a break,I assume you mean the VS 401?
56,5f6c2aaf7da9e46ccbe15480,Victas VS-401 revisited after a break,"I'm still using mine... it lasts longer than most tensors to me, but I do clean mine a lot, including regular cleans with foam cleaner."
56,5f6c2aaf7da9e46ccbe15480,Victas VS-401 revisited after a break,"If soften up over time, making it even better."
56,5f6c2aaf7da9e46ccbe15480,Victas VS-401 revisited after a break,I find it perfect for my game.
56,5f6c2aaf7da9e46ccbe15480,Victas VS-401 revisited after a break,"Cheers HaggisvWondering if I spinmax it with the new not yet released spinmax ( that david gave me ) I can keep it alive longer, I got a wear patch in the middle of the rubber and the grip had gone form the top surface.Yes VS-401 now fixedThis will my first post in over a year maybe or longer!I still look but stopped postingGreggy"
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,How much spin you get depends on a lot on your technique.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"With my technique I get a lot more spin out of tacky rubbers than non-tacky rubbers, which is why I prefer mildly tacky rubbers."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I've used both the Juic 999 Turbo & Tibhar Grip-S Euro, and they are very good for spin for me."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Speed wise the Tibhar is considerably faster and more lively than the Juic, but the juic is just a little spinnier."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Thanks, Alex, I sure am glad that you've had lots of experience.I have a sheet of Haifu Blue Whale II Factory Tuned 2.0."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Would you consider that the same as the Tibhar Grip-S Europe 2.0, or do you think it would play differently?"
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I put it on my backup twin blade last night, but need to get the right pips on to get an apples to apples comparison."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I don't want to ALSO need to buy the Tibhar in 2.0, if its just going to be the same, especially since the Tibhar Grip-S Europe 1.8 doesn't seem to be a stock item.Also, I have a sheet of Globe 999T 1.8 that I never opened from a year ago."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I wonder how close that would be to the Juic 999 Turbo, playing wise."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,I tried the Globe 999 1.8 and it was a good bit slower that the Yasaka back when I did my initial rubber tests.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Again with the Juic, do you think I should be trying the 2.0 instead of the 1.8?"
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I *DO* wish I could twiddle to my pips, but most of the time I've tried that I screw up the twiddle or chop badly because the pips chop is so different and those hard, fast loops are the toughest ball there is to be trying it on."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I hate having to give up on being able to attack, but maybe I just can't play with a rubber fast enough to do it with the smashing style I have currently if I want to also be able to chop back the big loops, and if that's the case, I'll just need to learn to place and spin the ball better to finish off points offensively when necessary.With the Yasaka, I put everything I've got into trying to coax spin out of the setup on serves, but I know others do much better, and I know from my previous tests that I was able to get more out of the Blue Whale II 2.0, but I just didn't seem to win matches against the tough opponents with it, as I seemed to have lost what offensive capability I had and my serves and chops still weren't good enough."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Maybe it was just that I needed to give it a lot more time to adjust, and get the shots all working optimally."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"It took months to get there when I switched from the Nitakku Narucross to the Yasaka, but I'm pretty certain that I'm playing tougher with it now than I did with the Nitakku, and maybe the same is true for whatever rubber I try to replace the Yasaka with.I can afford to buy a sheet or even two to find the optimal one, but just can't afford to be trying 4 or 5 different ones only to end up staying with the Yasaka, and that's why I'm out here trying to learn from other's experience before I try again.Again, I appreciate the benefit of your experience, as I just don't have the money to try all the possible rubber and sponge combinations, even if only looking at these 3."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"THe grip-s Euro has a considerably softer sponge than the the Blue Whale II, so it will play a little different.The Globe 999T is virtually the same as the original Globe 999, and although the topsheet is somewhat similar to the JUIC 999 turbo, the JUIC is less tacky and the sponge more lively, making it a lot easier to generate pace."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Since the Globe comes in a variety of sponge hardnesses, I can't compare this to the JUIC."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,If it was bought from a Chinese shop it's probably for a hard sponge.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,I've tried all 3 and concur with Alex's view point.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Using the rakza 7 soft for serving wil require faster contact because all you will get out of that is mechanical spin.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,The two tackier rubbers will aid spin on serves but will be less easy to counterloop with.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,They will have better short game touch and properties though so it depends on what you are going for.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Of the 3 I liked the grip-a euro overall and I fight myself not to buy another sheet.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,As far as the haifu whale 2 if you have the red sponge it's similar to grip s Europe but quality control from my experience is less.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Ok, well that helps too."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"By process of elimination, since I already have it, I can try the Haifu Blue Whale II Tuned 2.0 (yes, its with Red sponge) again, and try to determine if its lack of ability to chop it low and spinny or lack of attack shots working that caused me trouble with it."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"If its lack of chopping ability, them I might try the Grip-S Europe 1.8 since the Haifu isn't made in 1.8."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I seriously doubt that I'd be able to chop well enough with max, so that eliminates that.That leaves the Juic 999 Turbo."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Does anyone know whether the Juic 999 Turbo is faster or slower than the Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft with the same thickness of sponge?
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"If its faster, I should try the 999 Turbo in 1.8 first, and if its slower, it might be wiser to try the 2.0 first."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Whichever rubber wins out, since my biggest problem is chopping the hard, fast loops, I need to try to solve that first, and if necessary change my attacking style to adapt to the rubber since I do that less often anyway."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I played a couple hours of drills with the Haifu Blue Whale 2.0 Factory tuned, and it spun well, but the chops didn't stay low, so that means to go that route, I'd definitely need to try Tibhar Grip-S Europe 1.8 for it to have a chance of working out.Then tonight, I played 2 or 3 hrs with the Globe 999T 1.8 40 degree sponge."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,That was mostly practice match play against 1600 level players.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I had Giant Dragon Talon 0X on the backhand, so it was quite a stretch adjusting to it quickly and playing games."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I didn't lose any games, and went 5-0 in matches."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"At first I was going very short on forehand chops, but as the night wore on I was able to keep most of them low and land them."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"The forehand topspin required a different racket angle, and luckily I didn't lose any games because I was careful not to try to whack it unless I was confident it would land."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I still dumped quite a few into the net and some off the back, even playing conservatively.It sounds as though I should try a 1.8 of one of those two."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I'm leaning towards trying the Juic 999 Turbo 1.8 first since the Globe didn't seem too far off the mark, and then if it fails, go from there..."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"If you liked the Globe, than the Juic should be a faster version of this, so you'll probably like this too."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Thanks for confirming that.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,It will be ordered tonight.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"At this point, the whole effort is a failure."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I have adjusted to where I can chop pretty well on forehand with the Tibhar Grip-S Europe 1.8 mm, but I can no longer smash my way out of a paper bag, much less win a match against anyone that drops back and fishes."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I've been practicing both a lot the past few months, but with this setup my offensive ability has been lost.I played a match against a 1600 level fisher last night and he beat me 3-1 because I was completely exhausted from trying to smash the ball 5 times per point."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I was winning a lot of those exchanges eventually, but by the 4th game I was too exhausted to keep doing it."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Chopping didn't work, so I had to hit every ball with every ounce of strength I have and place them well to eventually win the points.Anyway, I guess the whole idea of having rubber capable of chopping the hard shots back on forehand was a big waste of time, effort and money, and a total failure.I'm not sure what I will try next."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Nothing seems to do any good.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"If I can chop well enough to return the loops with a rubber, I can't win any points hitting with it."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,It comes down to how you want to win the point.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,If you can tempt the fisher into attacking and chop them add a counter attack to take him by surprise then great.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,If you rely at all on an attack to win the majority of points then get thicker rubber.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,With the plastic joola ball I am finding my under spin to be more potent.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,I find it harder to open with tons of force currently.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,I'm sure I will adjust but it will take time.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,I think smashing power depends a lot on the blade too.... this is where a lot of the power comes from.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I'm going to try a ""one step back, two steps forward approach"" to the problem.I'm building a new blade, with 1.0 mm LESS balsa on the forehand side."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"Having made and played with a blade with that forehand setup before, I expect the forehand to be more controlled against hard hit balls but require harder hitting when smashing, so instead of putting rubber with 1.8 mm sponge on it, I will try 2.0 mm or MAX if need be and see if I can learn to both chop and hit better with thicker."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"faster rubber, in combination with the more controlled blade."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Perhaps that will also make it easier to fish and counterloop.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"The Tibhar Grip-S has been discontinued, so I will try the Juic 999 Turbo first, and just use the sheet of 1.8 mm I have at first and then go thicker if I feel I can handle it."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"In the event that doesn't cut it, having a blade that I can play with the thicker rubbers will also open up many options of hitting rubber that I can't buy with thin sponge."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I used to chop pretty well with Vario Big Slam MAX on the Donic Appelgren Allplay, so I know its possible, especially because my forehand chop is dramatically better now than it was then."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I am also hoping that my hitting ability has improved significantly in the past couple years since I played with that combo.And if the new blade doesn't get it done, I'll try the 2.0 or max sponge on the faster blade I'm using now."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I've been doing well blocking the counter attacks with my inverted, which is surprising because I've never really blocked before."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,I think I need to get other effective anti-fishing tactics learned and working too.
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"I wasn't very successful chopping the lobs, and I've never learned to do a drop shot."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,"If I could learn to do that, I could alternate rubbers with it and mix pips and inverted drop shots in with the smashes."
57,5f6c2ab17da9e46ccbe15481,Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft vs Juic 999 Turbo vs Tibhar Grip-S Euro,Maybe that would help.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"All of the Bluefires are a more recent generation of ESN, and don't really feel like R7Soft."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,So that's something I suppose!Yes.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Well, I suppose it depends on why you couldn't get in with T05, but if you're looking for something close to T05-FX then M2 is too hard IMO.M3 is the closest to R7Soft of the bunch, yes, but it's still quite different."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"M3 is soft, but it isn't as soft as R7Soft, and is punchier and more definite."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Less slingy than R7Soft.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"M3 is also high throw - big cartoon arcs on heavy strokes, where the dwell becomes more apparent."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I'd say M3 is the closest to T05-fx overall.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"M3 is heavily boosted in the factory, and loses a bit of pace when it wears out.I did have trouble with M3 on soft (hinoki) blades - couldn't get used to the gears on my BH side (great on FH though)."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"But I also had the same problem with T05-fx on the same blades, so just my technique probably."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Stick to medium outers (or harder, obvs) and you'll be fine regardless.IMO, no."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,JP03 is medium throw with a dead feel in the short game.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"The dead feel can lead to an overall feel of mushy mush mush, so if you're trying to avoid that then beware!"
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"JP03 is highly elastic in feel though, so it livens up a lot when you hit heavier shots."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"It's very similar to Rasant Powersponge, if you've tried that?There are tensors out there which fit your T05-fx search better than the Bluefires, IMO."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Tibhar 5Q Sound (Power Update) is a bit softer, but shares a LOT of characteristics with T05-fx."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"It loses out on spin overall, but is close in most departments otherwise."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"It's on sale at tt11 quite regularly if you keep an eye out.I have some of these rubbers in my cupboard, waiting for an eBay clear-out."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,You're welcome to try some out if you like?
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Send a PM if you want.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Andy,Many thanks for your reply, it was very useful!To answer one of your questions, yes I have tried Rasant Powersponge and I did like it."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"In fact, I was very close to using it as my primary rubber but it was only because I had a newer sheet of 05-FX available that I went back to it."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I found the Powersponge a LOT better than Rakza 7 Soft.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"The Rakza felt mushy, way too soft and horrible compared to the harder more positive direct feeling 05-FX."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,The Rasant Powersponge sat more in the middle of the two.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,It was softer but not too soft and had some real power when you hit it hard.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"I wonder of the two, whether M2 or JP03 would be better."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Ah, well there you go then!"
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"When I had Rasant PS, I couldn't tell much difference between it and JP03."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,They felt identical in the short game.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"The Rasant seemed to stay a bit lower on harder shots, so I'd probably call it a lower throw rubber than JP03 overall, but it's so, so close."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"I actually preferred Rasant PS for my BH side, but I stuck with JP03 because I can get Donic stuff more reliably and cheaply than Andro."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"They are so similar that I'd say you know 90% of how JP03 will play.M2 is faster, harder, higher throw, more aggressive than JP03."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"JP03 is a lot easier to use in the short game - it's not as sensitive to spin, and it's slower there."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,It just comes down to your needs really.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Are you the type to hit big, ridiculous loop monster winners (M2)?"
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Or do you play a variable offensive game with more control and variation (JP03)?
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"(I'm generalising wildly here, but you get the idea)."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,It sounds as if I could actually play with either.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,However I do prefer to loop as much as possible.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I guess my game could be described as close to the table counter attack where I use my pips to block and set up the ball.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"When the ball is high enough and I'm in position, the I loop / power loop it."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,So I guess you could say I play both a variable game with control (but that's probably more on my pips) and I also play a strong looping game on my forehand (as that's my primary attack shot).
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Not sure if that helps but maybe M2 would be more appropriate?
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"I normally use 05fx,I tried m3 but went back to 05fx.I liked the extra pop of the m3 but the loop arc was straighter and longer compared to the Tenergy and I couldn`t push as well, this was well used Tenergy which seemed spinnier to me,I think the m3 performance will drop fairly quickly compared to the 05fx which in the long run is probably better value along with the enhanced performance.Both rubbers were spinmaxed,the Tenergy reacted more to this treatment."
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Have you looked at Tibhar 5Q VIP ?I got 2 sheets of it but ended up selling them to 2 club mates.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Both are using it on their FH on a Clpper & a Xiom Zetra Quad.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,First guy loves it and wants another on the BH whilst the XZQ guy is only just getting used to it after 2-3 weeks but will ultimately look to change it (have a Tenzone SF lined up for him).5Q VIP has the same hardness as the 05FX and uses a large porous Tenergy like sponge.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Available in 1.7Top sheet of the VIP is the same as the 5Q which I had but was too fast on the BH of a IF ZLC and I didn't want to use it on the FH which lacked the consistent arc of the T05.
58,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,5Q uses the same topsheet as the VIP which had excellent grip.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,"Based on what players I know who use Rakza 7 and Rakza 7 soft, I'd expect the Rakza 7 soft to be, well, softer, spinnier, and a bit easier to use that Rakza 7."
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,"In turn, I'd expect the JP01 to be a bit faster, with somewhat less control."
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,"However, I've not used either.I'd suggest you use the search facility and see if you can turn up some reviews or comments."
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,thanks for the info
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,Are you planning on using the JP01 on the FH & the R7S on the BH ?Have not used either rubber but did use the M1 which was quite a difficult rubber to get the most out of being a bit too heavy and possibly a bit hard for the skill level I had at the time.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,The JP01 is supposedly a more tamed easy to use version of the M1 but lacks the top end of the M1.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,M1 had a high throw but unsure if the JP01 is as high.The R7S is a tensor unlike the R7 and is a very highly rated BH rubber.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,If memory serves me right it's 42.5 degree which for some is the magic BH rubber hardness and is referred to a medium soft.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,It's not that light but at least it's lighter than something like a baracuda which is of the same era.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,am already using R7 soft on BH and its a very great rubber on the BH side am planning to switch over to JP 01 and am just wondering if it would be a good idea i play with R7 on FH and R7 soft on BHi will continue with using R7 on FH
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,The JP01 is the medium hard the same as the M1.
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,For most it would be too hard to use on the BH most preferring to use it on their FH.Have you tried using your R7 that's on your FH for the BH to see how you get on ?jP01 is heavy like the M1 and could possibly upset the balance of your setup.If the R7S is working for you why change ?
59,5f6c2ab57da9e46ccbe15484,jp 01 vs rakza 7 soft,"i have tried M1 on the FH before but the problem is that each time i buy a new rubber, it is like i have bought another type of rubber, like each M1 has his own characteristics.so thats why i have stopped using M1 and since using R7, my playing has evolved, really great spongewell i was wondering if it was a good idea to change this setup i thought about the weight of the JP01 tooi have tried M1 on the BH as well but was not what i was looking for on the BH"
60,5f6c2ab87da9e46ccbe15486,DHS Hurricane 2 vs. Hurricane 2 Neo,Generally H2 topsheet is tackier than the H2 Neo.
60,5f6c2ab87da9e46ccbe15486,DHS Hurricane 2 vs. Hurricane 2 Neo,"The Neo Sponge is softer, lighter and more lively."
60,5f6c2ab87da9e46ccbe15486,DHS Hurricane 2 vs. Hurricane 2 Neo,"Both would be suited to close-in play, but the Neo version is faster and much easier to generate pace with."
60,5f6c2ab87da9e46ccbe15486,DHS Hurricane 2 vs. Hurricane 2 Neo,"Awesome, thanks for the help Haggisv!"
60,5f6c2ab87da9e46ccbe15486,DHS Hurricane 2 vs. Hurricane 2 Neo,Anyone else have input or experience on the matter?- Chumbucket
60,5f6c2ab87da9e46ccbe15486,DHS Hurricane 2 vs. Hurricane 2 Neo,"If I got this right, NEO is for the post speed glue era."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"There's a thread here discussing the difference between Hurricane 3 and Hurricane 3 Neoviewtopic.php?f=44&t=13837&p=149724&hilit=hurricane+3+neo+video#p149724I can't answer about the blue sponge version though, so will leave that to others who've tried both."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,the neo rubbers are pre tuned and are quicker than their standard brothers.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,they also feel harder.as for the blue sponge the are not pretuned but over all the blue sponge is somewhat better than the standard sponge.. to some people it has a better feel and plays alot better
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Tuning on the NEO is debatable, if there is any it's so weak that it may as well not be there."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Neo is softer than regular H3, not harder."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,The Regular Hurricane III is much tackier than the Neo H3.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,The #21 sponge version is also a little less tacky but not as noticable.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,The H3 commercial is rock hard.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,The #21 is medium hard the Neo is somewhere in between.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,However alot of H3 sheets out there are left over from the gluing days and those are quite a bit softer due to the glue effect but the density of the rubber remains so its pretty nice to play.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,If you have one of those laying around cherish it forever.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,H3 commercial is hard and needs regular speed gluing before play to 'soften' it up a little.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,Unusable without speed gluing.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,H3 commercial NEO is pre-tuned but loses its properties in about 1-2weeks after it is removed from the vacuum packaging.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,It is vacuum packed for a reason.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,Need speed glue afterall.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,H3 blue sponge #20 provincial is relatively softer and lighter than commercial.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,It also comes in NEO version.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,I have tried the 39 and 40 degree NEO versions.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Fantastic even without speed glue, well, not totally, reglue once a month."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,The China national team uses the blue sponge version.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,You will see it if you scrutinize the match broadcasts.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"However, what they are using is not commercially available."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Wouldn't the degree of tackiness be a function of the topsheet, and aren't the H3 topsheets all the same?Iskandar"
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"They are supposed to, since DHS would had only one of them ITTF approved, but but they are definitely different, and it's more than variation between sheets."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Actually, if you think about it, how would they enforce this, even if they wanted to?Iskandar"
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"The NEO rubbers are factory tuned, but the tuning is moderate."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"If you would like a speed glue feeling, you might need more booster."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,About hardness: the hardness of NEO rubbers are measured after tuning.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Therefore, the hardness mark means the same hardness in your hand as original Hurricane or Skyline rubbers."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,The reason why you feel they are different is because the tuned sponge becomes more flexible.
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,"Another point is, since tuning softens the sponge, when the booster goes away in about 3 weeks' time, the sponge will be about 1 degree harder than the marked value.By the way, we have noticed that DHS has slightly reduced the tackiness of the hurricane topsheet for slightly more speed to cope with the glue ban.Provincial and national DHS rubbers are known to at least have more even hardness across the entire sponge area."
61,5f6c2ad47da9e46ccbe15497,DHS Hurricane 3 vs NEO,Whether their sponges have the same composition and crafting technique as the commercial version remains controversy.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"Yes this is no surprise  Max sponge, especially in a softer rubber like Rakza 7 soft allows the ball to sink in a lot more, this means speed is absorbed more for blocking and the ball sinks in more and allows a longer dwell time, while this is a bit slower it definitely gives you the ability to produce more spin on the ball and usually create a bit higher arc on the ball."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"mmm...very, very interesting, since I recently let my short pips to play again with soft inverted rubbers... About these observations, I'll try to check with my Genius sound 2.0 and max..."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"@PRW,It depends on how you measure control."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"For example, you mentioned ""touch drop shots were more difficult""."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"Doesn't that mean it is harder to control on max where fine touches are required?Sorry and without being disrespectful, but I don't exactly agree with the slight loss of speed impression when moving from a 2mm to max inverted rubber."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"If anything, a thicker sponge inverted rubber should allow you to get more speed from your shot, regardless of the softness of the sponge:1) The key to it is, how the ball is hit - basically technique, standing position and timing.2) And secondly, how are you measuring speed - is it the speed in which the ball stays on the table, or is it the speed in which the ball travels regardless where the ball ends up."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,If it is measured by the former then you have to look at how you are hitting the ball - technique and sharpness issues.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"Of course, there are physics boundaries where the shot will not land on the table at any faster speed.Slightly off the topic, but please do not forget the hidden danger in using max thickness sponge too early."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"This being, it may inhibit or stagnate development - as it is far easier to develop better techniques with lesser equipment because you have to make up for the shortcomings; or another way of looking at it, the max thickness is sometimes too helpful such that you forget to develop your skills as you become too reliant on equipment."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"This includes a blade that is too good or fast - for example it is so much easier for me to block with my Acoustic Carbon blade vs say my Swifter or Legato 5A, yet I learn much more if I stick to my Swifter or Legato 5A."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,The only equipment which I think you should aim for the best are a good pair of shoes (injury prevention and movement development) and comfortable clothing.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"yes, it does - it is more difficult on max!"
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"I am gradually getting used to it though, so this may change after I get more used to the max rubber.no problem with your comments - I think the loss of speed is on direct hits."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"On loops, as I can trust the rubber to allow the ball to sink in more, I can actually go faster, as the arc is higher.1."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"Totally agree - on a flat hit, seems slower; on a brushed stroke, same, or slightly faster2."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"See above replies!Agree - but I am in my 50's, have been playing a very long time (with a 25 year break in the middle) and as I say, was very happy with 2mm... getting more control to me is a good thing, I wasn't looking for more speed."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"I have no illusions that I have to play with max because ""everyone else does"" or ""it's the best"" - I was just genuinely surprised at the fact that my control improved, opposite to what I expected."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"I agree though, for people starting out, or developing strokes, max could hinder development."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"I always enjoy reading TT 11 comments on equip., they are very good ..."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,Personally I prefer the max thickness in rubbers.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,What I've found is that the thinner 1.9-2.0 ones don't seem to perform as well as their thicker counterparts as they age with the thinner ones more susceptible to going hard.On some makes a max rubber can be hard to control compared to a thinner version e.g.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,a T05.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,For lifting under spin i always found a thicker one easier to use but in a counter rally it can go off the rails.After replacing a club mates tibhar defensive BH rubber with a 2.1 EL-P his setup weight jumped from a nicely balanced 168 grams to a not so nice 185 grams.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,I had recommended a 1.9 to keep the weight under wraps but he wanted a new rubber on as soon as possible.If the EL-p is anything like the R7S in the difference in weight between the max & the 2.0 it would / could have saved himself those all important extra 3 grams.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,Sometimes you have to opt for the thinner size just to keep the bat balanced.
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,He wouldn't be a happy bunny when he gets his bat tonight !
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,"Thanks longball, we try and do our best to help people out where we can."
62,5f6c2ad87da9e46ccbe1549a,2mm vs max - Rakza7 Soft,Equipment decisions can be difficult at the best of times and finding the right equipment can often take a lot of trial and error especially if you can't find any help!
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Short explanation in a different thread.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Those are my thoughts on difference between hard and soft rubber.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"I have no scientific foundation to prove that it works that way, but it makes sense to me..."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,I found your reply very very interesting.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"So, if i understood, in your opinion, a soft."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"rubber need less strenght(should, arm and forearm) and more rotation with legs and body."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Isn't it?If it is true, best player chose hard rubber because they can shot with less time than soft rubber, they have more speed because use strenght and degrees give power, but they lack of spin."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Isn't it?
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Is that opposite of what people generally use?
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Usually the soft rubber is in the BH with short stroke.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,I used to use a T05 for the BH (shorter stroke) and now in trying to develop a backhand loop (longer stroke) I'm using the T05FX.Problem I found with the softer rubbers on the FH is that the arc flattens out on a stronger hit so I use a medium rubber.Have noticed the odd player using a harder rubber on the BH than the FH but that is more the exception.Using a hard rubber can work on a softer blade e.g.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,a Nittaku Violin with something like an Evolution MX-P on the FH but if one was using a composite blade most would prefer a medium rubber.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,IMHO a MX-P would be too hard on the BH unless you were a pro.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,If you were looking to develop a backhand loop a medium soft rubber would be more suitable.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"I'm sorry to go against other opinions in the thread, but from what i know and experimented, usually:Spin: H > SSpeed: H > SArc: H > SThrow angle: H > s(The belief that softer rubbers result in more spin IMHO belongs to the old time of speed glueing, when the rubber was spinnier if it was softer."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"With modern tension rubber it's not like that anymore... it's the opposite, so for example Tgy, bluefire, evolution, vega and sigma and all other rubbers have more spin potential in their hard version than in their soft)The true advantage in using a softer rubber is the ""control"", because a softer rubber usually1) Is less sensitive to spin, so it's better to block easy (lower throw)2) Is slower3) Has more dweell time4) MOST IMPORTANT: a softer rubber works well even with a soft stroke, whereas a harder rubber usually needs a harder stroke to work well, so essentially hard rubbers have more potential but are harder to use and they are created to play at a higher level."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Softer rubbers engage the ball more easily and so enable the player to play lighter shots and control the ball easily.This also sometimes helps to spread the false belief that soft rubbers = more spin, because if your loop is not quite strong you will indeed create more spin with a softer rubber, but if your loop has good quality your potential with a harder rubber is higher!!"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"!In fact in world's top 100 you will see that almost everybody uses hard rubbers, expecially on their fh where thay want more arc and power."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Someone uses softer rubber on the bh to improve the block and the touch, usually players who doesn't search for maximum power on their bh...And at last, if you have a strong swing and use a rubber which is too soft, it might ""bottom out""."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"That means that the ball enters in the rubber too much and engages the blade, resulting usually in a strange and missed hit...If you write what your playstile is, your actual paddle and how you like to play your forehand and backhand we can help you in your choice too!"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Però TicTac toglimi una curiosità, chi sono questi ""a lot of players in italy""?"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,A me sembra che da noi più o meno a tutti i livelli e salvo eccezioni particolari valga la regola del dritto duro e rovescio più morbido da quello che vedo io.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,In che categoria giochi se posso chiedere?
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Dipende soprattutto da come giochi e da altro come dicevo, ma se sei un 5° difficilmente ha senso usare gomme davvero dure, così come se sei 3° forse le morbide non sono più adatte a te e puoi fare un salto di qualità... Comunque per queste cose puoi scrivere anche sul forum italiano, di solito ci azzecca parecchio l'utente Seguso """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sorry for the italian lines, i couldn't resist  Cheers"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Sorry if i'm speaking italian.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"If you want I can translate it.Guarda da me ho notato che in C2 la maggior parte usava una Tenergy 64 sul dritto e sul rovescio preferiva una gomma dura(la 05 o comunque altre), personalmente l'ho interpretato come una mancanza di abilità, nel senso che magari non sapevano usare il top di rovescio e infatti così effettivamente era durante la partita."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Nelle partite del cral in A1 invece ho notato che tutti usano gomme dure.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Quello che non sono mai riuscito a capire è come sia possibile che bobocica che tende ad avere un avambraccio a 90* e a non fare il movimento completo riesca a toppare con una 05 su un timo boll alc esattamente come uno degli stranieri(non mi ricordo misà sempre della carrara) con le stesse gomme ma ad avambraccio aperto stile ma long e con un movimento ampissimo utilizzando molta piu forza.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"E' per questo che mi sono incuriosito per quanto riguarda la gomma dura, nel senso che un top riesce benissimo anche se tendi a ottimizzare il tempo e quindi a non fare il movimento completo(come fa bobocica, top rapido a mezzo braccio).Poi per quanto mi riguarda, io ho cominciato da poco, sono un 5*, e ""dovrei"" essere un attaccante puro."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Con le baracuda quello che ho notato è che se uso troppa forza insieme ad un movimento ampio la palla va fuori.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"O non metto forza e faccio il movimento completo, oppure uso forza ma carico la metà."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Quindi pensavo di provare qualche gomma dura tipo la M1 o la jp01.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"E' ovvio che non sia da quinta categoria ma potendo giocare 5 giorni su 7 a questo sport spero di potermici adattare, anche se questo voglia dire perdere la maggior parte delle partite perche i top non vanno.Per quanto riguarda seguso, l'ho già fatto, nel forum c'è un topic dove le uniche cose che dice sulla gomma dura è che sia più utile per il blocco e per il taglio, quella morbida per top."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Puoi capire anche tu che dopo averlo letto ho preferito venire su questo forum(niente da dire a seguso, anzi personalmente lo stimo molto).Ok, now i'm speaking english.What Revan told is very interesting but I'm not understanding in what way hard rubber are so more difficult to use than a soft."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,In how much months of training could I be able to play with it?In these days I will try M1.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,I also tried a Jp03 2.0mm and i found very usefull on my BH(because I don't use strenght on my BH loop) but on the forehand it lacks of spin so my loops were easy to block and counterloop even if I had total control of the ball.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Mmm guarda... quello che scrivi un po' mi confonde.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,A parte che la tgy 64 non è che sia una gomma morbida... sul fatto che bobocica tiri come un cinese (se tira a braccio teso presumo che lo straniero sia tale?)
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"non sono molto convinto comunque conta che bobo ci mette tanto corpo e non solo il braccino anche se non sembra, semplicemente ha il braccio più corto... poi se è vero quello che dici magari è perchè lui boosterizza e lo straniero no...Ma lasciando stare questi discorsi (il mio consiglio è di non stare lì a guardare troppo i professionisti perchè ci sono tante cose dietro che non sappiamo e appena si comincia tendono a confondere...) la mia impressione è che tu sia ancora un po' perplesso a livello di tecnica... ti assicuro che quando sentirai bene il tuo top di dritto lo metterai dentro con qualsiasi cosa, cambierà solo la qualità della palla che esce."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Io gioco da pochi anni e adesso valgo praticamente un quarta basso, ti assicuro che appena ho iniziato davvero a ""sentire il mio dritto"" la palla ha iniziato ad entrare con qualsiasi racchetta mi dessero in mano... le differenze fra le dure e le morbide non influiscono su quanto fai lungo lo swing, dipende solo da quanto tiri forte: se hai abbastanza accelerazione nel braccio da comprimere per bene una gomma dura allora essa lavorerà molto bene per te, se invece hai un colpo meno deciso una morbida sarà più facile da far lavorare e ci giocherai meglio...Il mio consiglio?"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Per il dritto prendi una media e non sbagli di certo: S2 - M2(gira di più della s2)... o al massimo la JP01 che è medio dura ma con buon controllo.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Per il rovescio la jp03 è perfetta finchè non vorrai qualcosa di più cattivoSe vuoi chiedermi qualcos'altro o continuare il discorso contattami pure sul forum di Giorno, ho lo stesso nickname, così qui chiudiamo la parentesi italiana  P.S: mi ricordavo diversi i pareri di seguso sul discorso... probabilmente ricordavo male...I apologyze to everybody, i promise this was my last answer in italian"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,I agree with what RevannII said.One more factor IMHO is harder sponge has better precision/accuracy.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,Skilled players with very high racket speed may not want overly long dwell which causes too much carry and a delay in the ball release.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,For them soft sponge is like a slow delayed reaction trampoline effect even if they can keep from bottoming it out.
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Ok today i tried a Jp01 on forehand and a Jp03 on a Innerforce ALC.Very happy about Jp01 on forehand, very good control, enough spin(it was a bit better baracuda), very good speed, ok on blocking."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"It is a medium hard rubber, i think it is a starting point to will go on hard rubber in future."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"very good on looping near table, good far away on table if used strenght, very good on counterloops."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"M1 turbo and Jp01 turbo are much better but in my opinion it would be a too high jump if switched from baracuda.Not so happy about Jp03 on backhand, a bit slow, baracuda was better on catapult and spin but very very good control and best choice for counterloops.Next week i will try a M2 on backhand, before i want try these two rubbers a couple of days."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"I'm happy to see you are getting close to your aim  My advice is to avoid rubbers wich are too extreme, because even if they have better potential they are quite more difficult to use and require more skill and spin understanding... every time i canged from a most powerfull/spinnier/most difficult setup to a less powerfull/less spinny/less difficult setup it improved my game a lot, an not only because i'm a defender  I mean my attacking skills also!"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Above all i found the problem isn't usually if the rubber is too fast, but if it's too spin sensitive."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"They are beautifull because they are able to do powerfull shots and cuts with minimum effort, but they could damage your progress as a player  I think your setup is good enough to play in any league, maybe if you have a strong backhand tospin you migh consider a harder rubber even there, but that said, i think you could be happy with your racket untile at least 3rd category  Cheers"
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"Yeah i think i Will stay with this two rubbber at the moment... What you told is truth, a very hard rubber is too difficult to play, i tried M1 turbo and i found it a wall, very very fast but too much sensitive to spin."
63,5f6c2af67da9e46ccbe154ac,Hard vs Soft rubber,"I must thank you For the review and suggests you gave to me, i'm very happy about my game style at the moment!"
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,I've used them both and liked both..They are of 2 different beast.. will depend on your taste and style.
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"In my case both rubbers worked on either of my fh and bh,which is excellent."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"I can switch to 2 different setups in a match, an excellent advantage."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"Though I only switch when I see amarginal weakness within a certain shots to prevent an opponent from capitalizing on it and finding a better counter for it at the same time.if both will work on you but tried one of them first and the other later, you might not like the later rubber..whichever of the 2 you would have tried first."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"in my case, I've played with Rasant first and liked it so much..then I tried Rhyzm and hate it initially."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"After a while, a put the Rhyzm back and gave it more time,gradually I began to like it as much as Iiked Rasant."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"So, I put them both together but remember, this time I am more used to Rhyzmand just playing again on Rasant with it, at this time I didn't like the Rasant.."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"Which ist a turn around.Upon experimenting from it, switching rubbers from bh to fh and vice versa by turning the blade.. as I get used to both,I've now began to like both on both sides, each rubber having different advantage levels on either side."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"Being 2 different rubbers,I can make use of the goods of the other rubber over the weakness of the other in my shots."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"An excellent combo I must say.. at least for me.For the part of how the two compare and differ,I'll just rate them here against each one.Speed ------ Rasant is faster and stifferSpin ------- Rhyzm is spinier and more forgivingControl ---- Overall both rubbers are Equals, the control level varies on each strokes.Blocking --- Rhyzm better on passive, Rasant better on active.Short game-- Overall both rubbers equally excel, depending on which side of the hand you use them for.Flicks ------ Rhym better control on bh but equals Rasant on fh."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"Likewise, Rasant has better direction on fh.Neutrals/Negatives Rasant is faster and not spin sensitive against incoming spins, but less spiny."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"Rhyzm is spinnier and more controllable, but more sensitive to incoming spins."
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,Rasant is heavy on large blades but ads firmness to a lighter rubber on the other side of blade Rhyzm is light but adds no attribute effect to the other rubber.Blade used is 20 year old Armstrong Level 91.Much faster than Mizutani and less stiffer.. a tad faster than Viscaria.Hope these helps.. °Q(ツ)/
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"Wow, excellent comparison, thanks regiz.rugenz!"
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm, Your welcome haggisv!

64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,Great comparison!
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,Very thorough  Rasant is definitely the more 'active' rubber for the offensive!
64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,"thank you tabletennis11..Perhaps, we hear from you a little more of the new Grip and PowerGrip of Rasant.I wonder which of the 2 resembles more of the original Rasant topsheet."

64,5f6c2b0c7da9e46ccbe154b7,Rasant vs Rhyzm,I know for one from short reviews that PowerGrip is a lot grippier.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Bluefire m2 is one of the best backhand rubbers I ever tried.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,"Blocking is very very easy, not a very high arc and spin on serves and attack is very good."
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,"This is for the black version, first batch of red bluefire rubbers was terrible."
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Nowadays the red sheets are a bit better than before.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Acuda rubbers being sold now are the new and improved versions according to donic but nowhere near as good as first generation Acuda.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Innerforce ALC sounds like a very nice blade and should have more control that the MM.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Have owed a S2 and only briefly tried a M2.If you are looking for better blocking the S2 IMHO would be a better choice that the Bluefire M2 since the Acuda is a lower throw than the Bluefire.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,When I used the S2 it was well over a year ago so it may have been the older version of it looking at Elvis post since the current S2 might be different than what I used.M2 will have more speed than the S2 since it's chemically boosted and it's off the newer breed.If I was looking at a Bluefire as a preferred rubber I would also look at the newer generation JP03 but I haven't used it.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Weight can be an issue with some of the Bluefire rubbers - the S2 should be lighter and could balance the heaviness of the Baracuda.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,In the Czech open 2012 Bartosova Hana used S2 on both sides.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Top male player in my old club used S2 on his BH.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Another player in my current club uses S2 on the BH paired with a M1 on the FH.In relation to hardness the M2 appears to be a bit harder than the Baracuda whilst the S2 from personal experience is around the same.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,Personally I would prefer not to have a harder rubber on the BH in comparison to the FH.S2 would be the safer choice for the BH given that it's lower throw.
65,5f6c2b167da9e46ccbe154bb,Acuda S2 vs Bluefire M2,S2 will be softer than the M2 and still less than the FH with the Baracuda.Sponge hardness table....Acuda s2 45-46Baracuda 47-50Bluefire M2 50Bluefire JP03 46-47
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I was about to reply to your last thread from here...viewtopic.php?f=43&t=25380&start=30#p270798when I realised that you started a new thread in the Rubbers section.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I would like to revise my recommendation of the 5QS for the BH  I reckon for mid distance it will be too soft.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Re the 5Q & 5QS rubbers it appears that there has been a 'Power Update' which means that they are 3-5% better than the original so if get them make sure you get the new ones.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Got this from a German forum.http://forum.tt-news.de/showthread.php?t=156253Sticking to the Q series there is one rubber that might suit the BH better - it is the 1QS rated at 42.5 degree as opposed to 45 degree of the 5Q.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,1QS is lower throw so it should block better than the 5Q.I've lifted some figures from the Tibhar catalogue and included the Genius ones for comparison.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Looks like the Genius rubbers have more control but are less dynamic.There is also a 5Q VIP model and it's due out in April 2014.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It might be worthwhile emailing Tibhar to see if they can give you some catalogue figures and the degree of Hardness.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,One of the guys in the club buys directly off them and it seems the post is cheap.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If you want a different rubber to the 5Q on the 'other side' the 5Q VIP might be an option.So of the following rubbers 5Q 1QS 5Q VIP the ONLY one I have played with is 5Q.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Re-looked at the 5Q review on MyTT and Yogi bear thought it was brilliant and it could do everything.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,So if you're considering the same rubber the 5Q could be the best choice.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Did check out Tibhar Grip S Europe - there's a thread on the OOAK and of the 3 rubbers only the middle one Europe seemed to be a runner.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It's a hybrid and after a brief experience of Xiom Tau I would probably only look at this option if I had to after the plastic ball is official.

66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Baracuda 42.5came from here...viewtopic.php?f=9&t=24689&hilit=hardnessMy experience is on hardness in max thicknessT05 > 5Q > Baracuda = T05FXDoes this rule out the Genius rubbers ?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,….Tibhar Genius 47.5Tibhar Genius Sound 37.5And to totally confuse you - figures below are used relative to each other and not in combination with the above figures...http://tabletennis-reviews.com/referenc ... ess-table/5Q 50Baracuda 47-50T05FX 44-46T05 48-531QXD 53-55What I found with the 5Q is that the top sheet is slightly soft but the sponge is a little hard hence why it good at lifting under-spin and still has the power.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,A drawback of the 5Q is on blocking.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Reckon that the 'Tibhar 1Q Sound' is like a T25FX and might be worth looking into.Catalogue values from Donic rate the Baracuda as medium hardness so it looks like the 1QS = Baracuda on hardness.http://www.cms.donic.de/cms/en/2012-09- ... tings.htmlIn getting a more dynamic rubber on the new generations of rubbers they have better comparative control.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Downside is weight.Did you find out anything about the 5Q VIP ?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,No i didn't fin anything about this new rubber!So you think that 5Q is spinnier than Genius sound?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,http://www.contra.de/product_info.php/i ... 7cgu40v6qpI contacted contra and spoke to a nice guy who spoke excellent English.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,They expect to have the 5Q VIP on the 14th of April but he does not want to be tied to that date since sometimes the ships arrive 2 weeks late going slower to save on fuel !He did not have much information on the VIP except that it has a more explosive sponge.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,So 'we' couldn't work out if it was a replacement to the 5Q but it seemed that it would be a bit faster.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I got the impression that the sponge on the 5Q was slightly hard so I'm guessing that it might be slightly softer - essentially a mid way point between the 5Q and the 5Q sound.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Personally I would be tempted to wait and use an existing rubber in the meantime.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Comparing the 5Q and the 1QS sales they have sold 30% more 5Q and practically all in Max.I have no experience of the Genius Sound but Tibhar rate the 5Q higher in both speed & spin but less control.Genius Sound is the same 'softness' as the 5QS at 37.5If you weren't keen on the 5Q on the BH you could always go with the 5QS which has the most Spin as a stop gap.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,A problem you can have with softness is consistency although in theory you have more control.5Q Speed 109 Spin 115 Control 90 OFFGenius Sound Speed 101 Spin 111 Control 100 OFF5QS Speed 107 Spin 117 Control 95 OFF-What might be helpful for other more experienced individuals on the OOAK is if you could State how many years you are playing TT ?Are you playing competition or are you just a casual player ?How many hours a week are you playing on average ?How good do you reckon you are and are you getting any coaching ?I used to play a lot back from the table but I'm playing up closer and getting in with the attacks much earlier.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I started 2 years and 3-4 months ago, when I was 18."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,For the first year I had a coach who teached me offensive style.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I usually played 5 days at week.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"At second year I started competition without having any problem but i didn't have any coach(i continue training with plans, i don't know if in english are called in this way)."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Now before starting the new competition year i want training with a 7ply blade and become a real OFF player(now i have Korbel 5ply) and get lesson by a new coach!
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Great to see someone so enthusiastic.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Now you're ordered a sensible first carbon blade you really can't go wrong with any of the rubbers that you're looking at.I would be inclined to go with the same family of rubbers for the same feel on both the FH & BH.There are +s + -s for having the same rubber on both sides but if you're looking for 2 different rubbers I would be inclined to go for the 5Q and 5QS on the FH/BH and possibly look at playing a little closer to the table.Hopefully your coach or someone on the OOAK can advise.Whatever set-up you get I would be very interested to hear how you got on.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Sometimes with a new set-up your game goes backwards before it improves so persevere.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Keep your old blade intact since it can prove to be a useful fall back.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I think i will try 5Q FH and 5Qs.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"BH but I have 3 weeks to decide(competition ends).So, while waiting other adiveces, want you tell me your TTstory?"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,xD
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I'm going to chip in!Genius is old generation.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It's not particularly bad, but the newer tensors are much better in terms of durability and short game control."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I still like Genius Sound on the BH side, but Aurus Sound or Soft was a definite improvement on that.5Q is excellent."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,A really good FH rubber - it's a great choice.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,You'll love it on the Maze.5Q Sound is a very interesting rubber.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It's a lot softer than other recent ""soft"" tensors like Rasant Powersponge or Bluefire JP-03."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It also has quite a soft topsheet.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It's a spin monster.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It's very nice over the table - excellent short control, if a little jumpy."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,But it's very high throw on harder shots.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I don't like this on my BH - I need medium throw or below.I use 1Q Sound on the FH, and it makes a good BH rubber too."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It is faster than 5Q Sound, medium throw, powerful, good spin, and so suits me more than 5Q Sound, but it's a personal thing.If you want a high-throw, soft BH rubber, 5Q Sound is excellent."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It compares really well to Tenergy 05-FX, for example."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"If you don't like high throw, consider 1Q Sound (or one of the other 1000's of options)."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Hmm this is very interesting....high throw BH loop or medium throw but more speed?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I could try these day in the gym...
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Are you the same AndySmith on tabletennisdb ?http://www.tabletennisdb.com/table-tenn ... =andysmithWhat rubbers are you using at the moment on the FH/BH on the Korbel ?Andy has a good point that the 5QS could be too high throw for the BH and it's much softer than the Baracuda.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It might take too much re-adjustment.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I have been used baracuda for 2 years!
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,close to table i found not very good but mid distance looping is perfect(only BH).
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,A very close rubber to the Baracuda is the Adidas P7.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It's rated as one of the top 3 overall rubbers.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I bought my sheet off inters pl for €33.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It is rated as harder than a T05 but in reality it feels softer.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If you google it there are reviews.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It's not a mad rubber and is easy to play with.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Aside from the fact that it's high throw its a control rubber but I didn't think it was for the FH.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I've never paired it with the 5Q since there were both in black.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Feel that I'm going around in circles.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,What is worth trying is having a go with individuals setups at the club and at tournaments (when they're coming to an end).
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,You can learn a lot from what might work.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I haven't looked into the Tenzone series for the FH but they seem to be advanced rubbers and require a regular practice which may not be a problem for you.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Buying the wrong rubbers can cost more than opting for a tried an tested Tenergy option of T05 & T64 which I know you don't want to go down.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"In italy we don't have a lot of brand rubber, like Adidas =(5Q has 6.3 of throw angle versus baracuda which has 7.0."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It seems baracuda is better but i'm using korbel, with 7ply blade as MM I think I will not have problem and the throw would be the same.As for as 5Qsound, as for as blocking is better than 5Q?"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,5Q and 5Q Sound are both good blocking rubbers.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I prefer soft rubbers for blocking (not a universal opinion), and I thought 5QS was excellent for blocking."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"It just comes down to preference - soft or hard sponges?To multispoke - yes, that's me on ttdb."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Some of those older reviews make me cringe!
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,In a nutshell I reckon the 5QS will be worse for blocking than the 5Q.I haven't used the 5QS but personally I prefer a harder rubber for blocking.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I had a brief experience with a T25 and the only good thing I could say about it was that it was good at blocking.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Of the rubbers that I've used on the BH the T05 1.9 has been the best for me but I now have reverted back to a slightly softer or thicker rubber to get better lift on underspin balls.On the ratings on tabletennisdb I would take some of them with a pinch of salt but they are very useful as a guideline.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,When I tried the Baracuda on a Clipper CR for the FH it didn't work whilst with the Adidas P7 and better still the T05 it became a blade that I could just about play with.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If you decided to keep with your Baracudas and just change your blade form the Korbel to the MM it should be a smooth transition.Re the restriction on being only able to get certain rubbers in Italy why can't you get them on-line ?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,The recommendation from Theoligan on the Palio Blitz 42.5 would only cost €21.75 for a sheet from Eacheng.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If I was on a budget that would be a tempting proposition.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,The 5Q for me a revelation and was very lively but I'm not using it anymore.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If your game is spin based then the 5QS will probably suit.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,But if you are hitter or are looping from the table I reckon the 42.5 degree hardness sounds just about right.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,You can't get everything in a rubber - there are trade offs.Our No.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,1 ranked player used to use Baracuda on both sides but then changed the sponge to a slightly harder one.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,He's now using Coppa X1 boosted on the BH for lightness to compensate for a heavy FH rubber for his Forehand orientated game.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Since you're a developing player I'd be inclined to stick similar rubbers on both sides developing both your BH & FH loop.I thought your reviews were great.Always enjoy hearing different viewpoints.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Do you think is it better Blitz than 5Q for FH looping?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,All my game is based on FH looping and i usually play 1m distance from the table because my height is 185-186 and i can shoot very powerfull loop with legs+body rotation!
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I haven't played with the Palio Blitz but the 5Q is very easy to loop with.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If you can get it for €33 it's excellent value for money.If BH looping isn't high on your list the 1QS might be a safe option for the BH.Comparing the specs from tabletennisdb the Palio wouldn't last as long but will be lighter.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I'm thinking of ordering 2 sheets for the overweight ZLC AN.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,but why you don't choose FL ZLC?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Is it better than AN for looping?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I already have 2 ZLCs so I wouldn't be getting another.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Likely that I'll sell the heavier one since it ends up being too heavy for most with 2 tenergies.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I've also moved away from Flared and have a liking for Anatomic handles.From the reviews on MyTT on the 1QS and the 5QS an other rubber that I didn't put forward was the Evolution FX-P.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I had the FX-P and it was a very nice rubber and is not as soft as the 5QS.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Worth looking into.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It blocks well and has a little tackiness in the rubber unlike the 1QS.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Rated around 40-41 degrees compared 42.5 of the Baracuda.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,It's not as dynamic as the 5Q series but the FX-P felt very controllable and a good all rounder.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I could get it for €33 unlike the Q series which were costing €36 from a local supplier.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,FX-P has a cut weight of around 45-46 grams so it was on the heavy side.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Another safe option.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Tomorrow i'm going to order my new blade...but today a club friend suggest me buy IZLC and not a MM....
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I'm very confused....rubber will be 5Q for FH and 5Qs/1Qs(it depends by blades) for BH.I don't know, i like looping at mid-distance, my height is 185 so i'm not so fast, fast loop or better control??"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,You don't need to be confused... you're just over analyzing a bit.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,The IF ZLC is a most premium blade.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I tried out my second one yesterday with Joola Maxxx 400 on both sides.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Plays great.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I would ignore the durability rating of Blit'z at ttdb.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I been using the same sheets for months and they're doing great.Some people have no idea how to take care of rubbers... then again, they're being misled by places like Paddle Palace to use abrasive sponges and cleaners which dry out the rubbers.I've used donic bioclean and plastic sheets for years."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,My rubbers last much longer than most ... b/c most are scrubbing their rubbers and letting them oxidize
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"theo in your opinion which is better between IZLC or MM with 5Q with my game style?As for as Blitz, i want try it but i didn't find them in any italy shop!"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I've never played with 5Q so I don't know.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Just order Blit'z from ttnpp
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"We're about the same height (I'm 6'1"")."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I recommend using a ST handle.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I think there's a good reason that nearly every European male player uses a ST handle.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"When I started getting coaching, one of the first things that was addressed was the fact I was rotating the paddle slightly when transitioning from BH to FH and vice versa."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"Essentially, I didn't have a good neutral grip."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I discovered that was in part due to using a flared handle.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"Since I have wide palms, my hand ""collides"" with the flared portion when doing a backhand.I sold all my flared blades and now have only straight."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,OMG I love you xD I've never heard about this site...i'm going to order 1 blitz and 1 5Q now!
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,xDPS.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,blitz 47 or blitz 42?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,What changes?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I've only used blit'z 42 (tried it on many blades)... in fact, I'm about to go pick up my recent order of some sheets.blit'z 47 will be a harder sponge.. possibly a lower trajectory."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,they share the same topsheet
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Got an email back from china friend (eacheng) and if ordering the 42.5 degree Palio Blitzhttp://www.eacheng.net/index.php?act=detail&ID=2875from them there are instructions at the end of this post since you have to specify the hardness.ttnpp price is cheaper at $28 (compared with $30) but when you select € on their web site it states €24.36 so something isn't right.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I didn't check the postage cost.If you are looking to order a IF ZLC I wouldn't recommend the 5Q for it.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,My experience is that it didn't work on the FH where I much preferred the Tenergy 05 and on the BH you would need to be red alert.If the Palio Blitz or the Joola Maxxx 400 has worked for theologian on his IF ZLC then I would go with his recommendation.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"The Tenergy 05 rubbers worked the best for me on the 89 gram IF ZLC (straight) of the ones that I tried which included P7, Andro Powersponge, Baracuda, FX-P, EL-P, T05FX and 5Q."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Although the 5Q was my favourite of the alternatives I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone else an IF ZLC.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,The FX-P would be safer bet on the BH and is possibly  similar to the Joola Maxxx 400.To go from a Korbel to an IF ZLC is quite a big jump.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Have you asked your coach for an opinion ?If you're going to plumb for an IF ZLC the Straight handle is very nice and IMHO is much more preferable to a Flared handle.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If on the other hand I was going for a TB ALC I would get the Flared because the Straight handle is too small and it's liable to come away from your hand with sweat.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,The MM that the guy in the video is using a Flared handle.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"Specs of the MM show that the Straight handle is slightly bigger than the TB ALC but it would be preferable to try them out before you press the € button.The sensible option would be to get the blade first, try out your existing rubbers on it and then go from there."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,But that would be the pot calling the kettle black.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"China friend in eacheng.net...If you have requirement for sponge hardness, you have to write your sponge hardness requirement in order postscript when creating an order Read the setp2 in the following link to know how to write demand in order postscript : http://www.eacheng.net/index.php?act=page&ID=76"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"Indeed, I found the TB ALC handle too small... too short actually."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Whereas the TB T5000 ST handle is just fine  the MM ST handle is also bigger than TB ALCstrange
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I own a 1Q and 5Q.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"I love 1Q on FH, faster than 5Q and a wee bit less spin."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Much better than 5Q if you chose to step back from the table to loop and counter.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"Near the table, 5Q works for me, you can load up with spin on loops, pushes, serves."
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,5Q is a real spin demon for me.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Ok coach told me to get maze....so maze 5q 5qs on bh or blitz fh 5qs bh?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,At the start of this thread you said that you play at mid distance.If that is the case the 5QS at 37.5 degree might be a bit soft particularily when you've being playing with a Baracuda at 42.5 degree on the Korbel on both the FH & BH.To list some of the options mentioned to-date I would have a bias or the first one since I haven't used the other ones.FH / BHTibhar 5Q / Evolution MX-P for the MMPalio Blitz 42.5 / Palio Blitz 42.5 MM or IF ZLCJoola Maxxx 400 / Joola Maxxx 400 for the IF ZLCIf Tenergy was an option for the MM I would go with T05 on the FH and T64 on the BH.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,These can be got for €40 a sheet from ta-q.nethttp://ta-q.jp/en/but I would opt for 1.9 on the T05 if it's your first time on the Tenergies and 1.9 on the T64 if the MM blade was heavier than 89 grams.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,MX-P?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Are you sure?
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Last posts you told FX-P on BH.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Sorry !
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Meant to say FX-Pmx-p would be too hard unless you're a pro !
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"ok i'm going to buy 5Q, FX-P and one Blit'z and try which is the best combination for my style!"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,good plan...
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,I look forward to your findings
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,"regarding durability of Blit'z, I would add that I have removed and reglued some of my sheets several times.... and still I say, Blit'z is very durable"
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,If you plan on getting the rubbers in from Japan would suggest that you opt for the courier option.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,An Italian guy that I compete in team events with got caught by customs and has to pay extra for them to release it.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,He had opted for standard post but it's ending up with it costing him a lot more.Hopefully we haven't led you too far astray with your choices.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Best of luck.
66,5f6c2b2d7da9e46ccbe154ca,5Q vs Genius,Thanks all for suggests gave to me!I will let you know!
67,5f6c2b327da9e46ccbe154ce,Evolution vs 1Q/5Q?,The Tibhar evolution and Q series rubbers are high quality.
67,5f6c2b327da9e46ccbe154ce,Evolution vs 1Q/5Q?,I haven't used the R7S nor the 5QS but they seem similar but the R7S is the only one that's deemed a tensor.With a MX-P since it's hard it needs a medium composite blade but it does work well on a Nittaku Violin.
67,5f6c2b327da9e46ccbe154ce,Evolution vs 1Q/5Q?,From my experience with an EL-P I would have thought that a MX-P would be very durable.
68,5f6c2b3c7da9e46ccbe154d4,Tg3 vs grip s Europe vs 999 turbo,Well I haven't used 999 turbo.
68,5f6c2b3c7da9e46ccbe154d4,Tg3 vs grip s Europe vs 999 turbo,But by all accounts those are the three best tacky rubbers in most peoples eyes.
68,5f6c2b3c7da9e46ccbe154d4,Tg3 vs grip s Europe vs 999 turbo,"TG3 is harder than grip s and because its harder it make more spin but isn't as ""nice""to use."
68,5f6c2b3c7da9e46ccbe154d4,Tg3 vs grip s Europe vs 999 turbo,All three are good so I doubt it matters much.When in doubt I always know I can buy a sheet of tg3 and I'll be a good rubber.
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"I have used the Innova UL with 1,5-1,8 sponge on Re-Impact balsa blades (my own and my son's)."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"My impression is that it bottoms out easily, but that compared to most rubbers there is a more gradual transition from spinny (when engaging sponge) to a spin-insensitive flat-hit rubber (when the sponge is more or less ""bypassed"" through bottom-out)."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"Not sure whether that effect is due to rubber topsheet, sponge, balancing firmness in topsheet and sponge, an effect of balsa, or my imagination."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"The boy is still using it, and it gives sufficient spin and speed for his abilities, with the added control you mentioned.For myself I found that I needed more headroom for speed and spin, so I changed from the Innova to the KTL pro XP."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"For my game, they are not so different."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"The KTL only a little more ""reactive"", which works both ways, of course (it is also more sensitive to incoming spin)."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,keme: many txs your reply.
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,I had noticed that you used Innova at one time and the reason for your shift to KTL is clear.
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,Will continue to use the Innova and perhaps the weaknesses--other than the slower speed I mentioned--will develop.
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,"But at this point, am really quite satisfied."
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,My side spin short loops from about 1m were great tonight causing difficulty for blockers and Seemiller types.
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,Still......am always skeptical about something that seems so good.
69,5f6c2b427da9e46ccbe154d7,Mystery: Innova vs Others,Will keep informing.
70,5f6c2b577da9e46ccbe154e0,Butterfly Tackiness Chop vs Tackiness Chop II,From what I can remember TC has a softer sponge and TC II sponge is pretty hard.
70,5f6c2b577da9e46ccbe154e0,Butterfly Tackiness Chop vs Tackiness Chop II,I believe the top sheet is the same.
70,5f6c2b577da9e46ccbe154e0,Butterfly Tackiness Chop vs Tackiness Chop II,Don't hold me to that.

71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Do you play from mid distance any and if so how would you rate their performance in that area?
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,What about in terms of put away power if your opponent is playing off the table/defense.As an aside they sound similar to what I have been using on my FH recently (sword maze and also apollo 3-although A3 is more chinese tacky)
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I didn't like the Grip-s at all, its well below TG3 in spin performance for my stroke."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I haven't tried Vega China, I was happy with Thors until I went on a slower equipment campaign."

71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I always wanted to try 999 turbo as I'm sure I'd love it and get bulk spin from it, on the other hand I always preferred a reaaaly hard sponge so I'll give Tau a go."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,What are the difference between the Vega China and the Asia ?
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Would it be good to do this intentionally if you like non-tacky mechanical spin rubbers?
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I beleive only the China is tacky... the other is just grippy.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"Yes it can be... it would certainly remain very grippy, and would become less sensitive to spin."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I've only had a brief hit with the original Grip-S, but the euro does seem more spinny for my stroke."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"Sponge of the Euro is softer though, so you might not like it."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I'll be very interested to hear how you like the Tau...
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"Yes my references to speed above, are the same for mid distance..."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I often find myself there.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"Against defensive players, the 999 turbo lacked some putting-away power, but it's still decent and on a faster blade no doubt it would be better."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"The Vega China will continue to give more speed and spin even at high speed, whereas the Grip-S euro flattens out a bit at high impact (which I actually like the feeling off).I have not tried the Apollo 3, but the Apollo 2 lacked severe putting-away power... it seemed to miss the top gear."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Perhaps a faster blade would solve this.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I haven't tried vega china, but I play with both 999 turbo and grip -s europe.I agree grip -s europe played the best overall."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I didn't really see the drop in performance that much.I feel like 999 turbo was slightly slower and more difficult to block with.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I guess the only thing is price.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,For me it's a $10 difference.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"thank you, and does the Vega China have that black sponge ?"
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"HaggisvDo you think Xiom vega china is the fastest chinese rubber for now?I tried: Thor's, grip-s, moon pro, sun pro, transcend SP, Topenergy, TG2 neo, Mercury 2 (all max sponge)"
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Xiom Tau is the fastest.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Isn't Grip S just the hardest version of the upgraded Blue Whale II?
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I really liked Grip S Euro.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,@haggisvWith respect to these rubbers I asume that the Victas 401 might be interesting for you.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Is Thor's and Vega China pretty similar?
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Funny how I didn't like this rubber grip-s/bw ii and now I love it..
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,It's still spinless compared to a hard tacky but worth it for the ease of use.Never did try Tau in the end either.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"[quote=""foam""]Funny how I didn't like this rubber grip-s/bw ii and now I love it.."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,It's still spinless compared to a hard tacky but worth it for the ease of use.Is that blue whale II soft?
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I just tried this on Defplay and whilst it did some stuff well I couldn't get enough feedback from the combination,I noticed when I cut the rubber that it was very dense and probably the most difficult to cut rubber I have seen even though it`s way softer than h3, I could also feel the ball better with h3,I gave up on it after 1 session and went back to the Tenergy which loops without effort whilst sacrificing the tight short game of the blue whale,maybe it deserves more time?]"
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Well tenergy Im sure is better once you adapt to it but im not going to invest in it when whale soft is doing everuthing I need.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,My sheet of whale is more than a year old.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,I don't think one is an alternative for the other... they are very different rubbers and require different strokes.
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,"I can get much more spin out of the Grip-s than Tenergy, because my stroke is optimised for these rubbers."
71,5f6c2b8d7da9e46ccbe154fe,Vega China vs Grip-s euro vs 999 turbo,Others will find the opposite.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,I can add to this as I have been playing with Vega Japan for a few months now.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,I play a modern defensive game with long pips on the backhand.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,I actually chop quite a bit against loops on the forehand and find VJ quite a bit less bouncy than Tenergy.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,This may simply be the fact that it is less reactive to incoming spin.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,"When comparing to Tenergy, I find VJ more controllable on both looping and chopping (especially chopping)."
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,"I played for years with Palio CJ8000 Japanese Sponge on my forehand, so I am no Tenergy expert."
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,I just know I immediately had more control with the Vega Japan than Tenergy.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,The VJ seems to offer more speed than the CJ8000 while still remaining controllable.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,I give it two big thumbs up!
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,Thanks ckhirnigs113!Yes I only noticed it felt a little more bouncy for the short game...for anything else I had no trouble and the control felt good.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,The main reason I never bought it was that it shrunk pretty quickly on my club mate's blade.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,^^^Did he/she use water-based glue?
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,I have detached and re-attached Vega Japan a few times on my blade and have noticed no significant shrinking.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,"For me, the xiom vega japan shrunk a little under 2mm ( it shrunk quite uniformly around all sides)."
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,Never experienced shrinking before this.
72,5f6c2bb07da9e46ccbe15513,Xiom Vega Japan vs Tenergy 05,"btw, i too use a vega japan/ t05 combination!"
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Tenergy 05 is obviously topspin beast but is there anything better for bottom spin chops?
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Tackiness chop sounds like it would fit the bill.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,If you want the best backspin chops wih the most control...My experience tells me Hurricane 3 Neo
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"DHS Skyline II - slow, hard, tacky chines rubber."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,May suit somebody looking for controlled backspin chop.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Plays good on off / off- carbon blades.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"i thought this thread was a tenergy vs barracuda side by side comparison, anyway can you compare them?"
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,pros and cons?
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"Question asked and answered, simple!!"
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Nobody stops anybody from reviewing Barracuda or T05
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Tenergy felt like I was using god mode and Baracuda felt like just a good all around rubber with less control.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I guess it will wear out just as early as the next.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I'll probably stick with it until everyone can come to a concensus on its replacement.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I lack varied experience with a lot of rubbers I just know that they compare t05 with Baracuda but I don't think it's in the same league.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,What's supposed to be the closest non-btfy rubber?
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I am seeing Xiom Omega IV Pro a lot.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Oh and the Baracuda top sheet looks all faded in the middle already and played it the least of my other rubbers.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Mark V and Narucross still look brand new.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"We have a butterfly equivalent thread somewhere on the forum, that offers a list of alternatives to T05."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"None will feel the same, but they are other and cheaper options, and some may work better for you."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"T05 may be best for topspin, but you need to consider other parts of you game as well."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"thinner sponge tenergy for more bottomspin, better than tacky chop,your return is low,fast,controlled and loaded but you`d loose out in the looping on tbs with thinner sponge"
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"A few weeks agoo, someone on this forum adviced me the Baracuda."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,This rubber definitely boosted my game and I win alot more matches.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,Spin is really great.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"I'm wondering if there are other rubbers with the same ""speed-spin-controle"" qualities in the price range of the Baracuda."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"playingforfun, Donic Acuda S2 and Andro Hexer Duro, but they have less spin and lower throw, or so I've heard.Edit: removed stuff irrelevant to the thread."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I've read a couple of revieuws between the two rubbers and people have different experiences.- Speed: most thinks that ten05 is faster.- spin: different opinions.- controle: different opinions.Wat do u think?
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I've also read that Barracuda plays much better in 2.0 than 2.2.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I believe this as the one time I played Barracuda it was in max sponge and it has a funny catch and throw feel to it.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,"It's not what I would call ""dwell""."
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,It's something different.
73,5f6c2bdb7da9e46ccbe1552f,Tenergy 05 vs Baracuda,I thought it just felt odd.

74,5f6c2c357da9e46ccbe15567,Victas inverted rubbers: V>01 (limber) - VS>401,A member of another forum played with it and was mighty impressed.
74,5f6c2c357da9e46ccbe15567,Victas inverted rubbers: V>01 (limber) - VS>401,He was especially surprised by the blocking capabilities and the control this rubber offers.

74,5f6c2c357da9e46ccbe15567,Victas inverted rubbers: V>01 (limber) - VS>401,I wonder if it' actually tacky (ie sticky) or just another word to describe high grip?
74,5f6c2c357da9e46ccbe15567,Victas inverted rubbers: V>01 (limber) - VS>401,Its not tacky or sticky.
74,5f6c2c357da9e46ccbe15567,Victas inverted rubbers: V>01 (limber) - VS>401,Just high grip.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,I have used the S1 Turbo on a Donic Ovtcharov Soft Carbon and I wasn't mad about it.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,I have no experience of the Joola Rhyzm nor of the Hallmark Aurora blade.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,Comparing the S1 Turbo with a Donic Bluefire M1 (I was using that on a Stiga CarboKev at the time) the black M1 was heavier and had a tigher arc than the S1 Turbo and overall was a better performer.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,The S1 Turbo came into it's own when smashing and was more consistent than the M1.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,I'm still unsure if it's a harder rubber than the S1.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,Have not heard of anyone using a S1t on the BH and seems to be primarly used on the FH.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,I wouldn't order one again and would think that there are better more versatile rubbers that can be got now.
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,"IMHO I would classify the S1t as low to medium trajectory, good spin, excellent speed and better at playing a bit back from the table."
75,5f6c2c437da9e46ccbe1556f,DONIC ACUDA S1 TURBO VS JOOLA RHYZM CAN ANY ONE COMPARE??,"The old Acuda rubbers were fantastic with great control, spin, speed and feeling."

76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,I don't know how they differ in play but I got convincingly beaten by a guy that uses Sun last year.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,He plays division one or higher.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,So I know that rubber works.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,the differ in pip size.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,"since yinhe went ahead and tried to copy the tenergy series as best as they could so that they can claim T05=moon T64=mars2 T25=sunobviously they dont quite play as tenergy, but sun has larger pips(where as mars 2 i believe has more spread out same size pips) with the rest being the same."
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,So id guess Sun differs from Moon just the way T25 differs from T05
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,I though the difference would be night and day  .
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,I think not much difference at all.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,Have only a short hit though.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,"So...they are pretty similar, but Sun would be more of a hitting rubber and moon more for looping?"
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,Spot on.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,I was far more impressed with moon pro than moon though.
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,"Softer, spinnier and maybe also faster."
76,5f6c2c4f7da9e46ccbe15577,Galaxy moon vs. sun?,Plain old moon seemed quite lifeless to me.
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,ive used both H3 prov and Neo prov while the Neo version feels great( nice crisp feeling) straight out of the pack.

77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,but i loved the crisp feel of it when new.. i dont know what its liek to play with a after a few weeks cos i then sold it on to someone else.
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,"think of it as the rubber like the top Chinese players use its sounds the parton the other hand i still have my H3 prov which was a great rubber compare tot he commercial, much softer from the beginning and more consistent."
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,"not much gain interns of speed, and is great for those all out strokes and 4rd ball killers as well as close to the table ( net) put away shots."
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,"so its really the safer way to go, kinda.. you could always get both as neither cost that much..as with h3 prov even a thin layer of SG will liven it up."
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,"which i do myself as i like the feel of SG, not for the performance gain, if there was only away to have the glue feel withou the speed gain."
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,"cos with the current speed its easier to use your own strength and go all out without fear.iv bought mine from ttnpp.com and they seem reliable in terms of legitimacy.i play with tg3 blue sponge at the moment which is kinda like h3 prov maybe a bit quicker and less sensitive to spincheck out the youtube link in the sig... in the older videos i was playing with h3 prov( back then my skill wasnt that great), where as the more recent ones i play with tg3BSalso are you SH or C-pen player?"
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,Yep decoy i agree with allalso it depends on the degree on the sponge that also helpsonly really difference between Neo and and old is Neo has more power with each shotand the old one has more control and spin but the neo give the opponenet alots less time to recover on each shot
77,5f6c2c507da9e46ccbe15578,Hurricane 3 Provincial VS Hurricane 3 NEO Provincial,TG3 Bs is also good at that

79,5f6c2ca87da9e46ccbe155af,Donic baracuda vs Acuda s2,Acuda S2 has a thicker top sheet and shorter pimples than most of the other rubbers from that generation so it plays a bit different.

82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,There is a relatively recent thread somewhere on OOAK where Rasant is compared to T05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Opinions between these two appear divided.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Some like Foam prefer Rasant whilst others claim it lacks the spin of T05 and is inferior for looping.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I'm not sure about Bluefire but I'm sure it is compared to death with T05 at one of the TT blogging sites.I think a lot comes down to what standard you are.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,If you are below 2000 or so it ain't going to make much difference so go with the cheapest one.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I played the last tournament with Rasant on my backhand, ultimately it's too fast for me but it makes a lot of spin with the speed and has enough grip to do just about anything you want against serve, if you have the confidence to use it how it want's to be used and that's something very important with this rubber."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I use a tacky rubber on the forehand and prefer that over any Tensor or T05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Rasant is not especially good for my forehand stroke just like T05 isn't especially good.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I just find Rasant ""less not good"" .I also perceive it makes more spin than T05 when playing against them."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"That could be just because I'm so used to playing against T05.. then again I see balls coming off Rasant do some very strange things at times on the bounce that I haven't seen happen since speed glued 38mm balls so I'm sure it's making a lot of spin.One thing is that Rasant is harder to control than T05 because it's bouncier and faster, Bluefire is just slightly different to Rasant, not different enough to write the story twice"
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thanks foam.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,That surely helps.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I am hoping someone who really likes T05 and is a current T05 or T64 user will review Bluefire.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Not many comments from people like that.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Someone send me a sheet and I'll tell you how I feel it plays as I am explicitly loving my t05 and t05fx
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,This is exactly the output I am expecting but I was not able to communicate it sufficiently.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I love playing my T64 and when I tried using Samba +, I am not satisfied with the topspin speed."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,T64 is pricey.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I am looking for equivalent rubber that plays exactly like tenergy 64 and 05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thanks Baal for clarifying.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Petermoo has a review an compares it to T05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"But he doesn't use T05 or like it very much, so even though he is a good player, for me it is not that useful, at least not by itself."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,He says they have some of the same feel.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I would be more confident if several people who were really looking for that unique T05 feel would try Bluefire.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Red, having used T64 only briefly before, and having used T05 somewhat more, I think Rasant carries the best of both worlds of those rubbers."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Its a beast in being able to spin up the ball in Tenergy fashion, but remains fast when hitting with less spin and more slap...more along the T64 line, less along the T05 line (I found T05 to be quite slow when slapping)."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I have switched to Rasant from Hexer Plus on my main setup simply because I like the feel of Rasant more and I get more spin from it in almost every situation...and more speed.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Its not a huge difference to Hexer Plus in feel, and I feel they are almost interchangeable for me, but Rasant just feels slightly more polished somehow."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I haven't used T64 enough to compare them point for point, but I don't think Rasant loses out to it in any way from what I recall of T64 (it has been a while)."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I had the same thought...so I have changed the title of the thread to avoid confusion for others.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thanks Reb for the share and for correcting the title  .
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Today I had a 5 minute hit with a friends bat - Tenergy 05 on one side and Rasant on the other (I think the blade was one of those silly 2 foot thick TSP balsa thingys).
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,All I did was loop against block and I must say they appeared (to me at least) very very similar.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,MAYBE T05 has a touch more spin but I wouldn't put any money on it.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Rasant certainly appears to be good value for money.btw - I'm not a regular Tenergy user.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Ok I just sold my unused but new GFX card and have some cash to spend, I think that I'm going to check out the Rasant and Bluefire in 2.1 and 2.0mm respectively."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I should have them by next week on the blade with some hours in play.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I'll compare it to my T05fx that I've got on now although I think that they may be a tad to fast for my current blade at least Ill be able to compare the 3 kinds of rubbers that are listed in the thread and on the one rig...
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I will be testing an Orange, Blue and Green sponge..."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Wow.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Finally a complete review
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Haha yeah, Something like that."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I do think that the Bluefire will be better for me from what other people on the interwebs have been saying about Bluefire and Rasant.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,But then again you really have to have a go at it to see what works.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I like the T05fx a lot, so I should be able to see what the feel difference is between the 3 and give a comparison from a tenergy users perspective."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I'm looking for a replacement for the Joola Express Two I have on my BH, as I dont like the feel of it, not enough touch and dwell for me compared to the T05fx when I swap between the two for testing, it also feels less spinny on the loops or serves."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"So what ever the better rubber is, bluefire or rasant, I'll migrate to that one for my BH... Alternatively I could just buy another sheet of T05fx, but this is more fun... and educational."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,At least thats my excuse.I was lucky that my spare gfx card sold... so now I can blow that (spare) cash on the rubbers  Like a boss Equipment Junkie
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Looking forward for the review apophis!
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It's a long time now,""apophis"", since this post, so hopefully you're ready to let us know your opinion of the differences between bluefire m1 and rasant ."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"i'm realy interested in a comparison between these 2 rubbers,are there real differences here,more than just the color of the sponges?"
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"it would be much appreciated if anyone with experience with these two rubbers would share his views with us,thank you!"
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I did get a hit with the Rasant the other month and it felt good, I didn't get the Blue fire as when I ordered them the rubbers where lost in post so when I got my money back from the seller I got a fully bty set up as in my sig I got a sheet as a tester from someone else at the club as they didnt like it.The Rasant I used was pretty fast, at least 2.1m sponge when I measured it with the ruler."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It felt springy and was more difficult to play on the short game then T64, as the ball seemed to ping off the rubber quicker, I dont know if its the tension effect on the topsheet or something different."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"When you can engage the sponge by hitting harder strokes it felt similar to T64, fast, spinny..."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Though I still found the T64 easier on the short game.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Again both are fast rubbers so I'm unsure what the difference is with the Rasant to make it more difficult playing the same short strokes, the Rasant does feel faster on the TB-ALC."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Serving I found did not have too much of a difference, maybe a little less spin, but not really much to make a huge difference."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Playing back from the table the two rubbers feel much the same on the strokes, with the Rasant seeming to have a flatter trajectory of the bat and a little less topspin on the ball.It really depends of your game, I think that if people are topspinning the ball heavily, the better rubbers would be the T05 or T64 compared to the Rasant."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,The Rasant is feels more suited for a counter hitting and flat driving/hitting sort of game to me.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It may suit some punch backhand players as well where the speed is likely going to be more of an advantage, or maybe even suit some backhands of players."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Over all I found the Rasant a little less forgiving on stroke play, but I think with more time to adjust and get used to the rubber it would be a fine rubber in its own right."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"thank you ""apophis"".if you'll ever happen to have a hit with Donic bluefire m1 as well, it 'll be interesting to read your comparison with rasant.can anybody else contribute his knowladge about this Rasant vs bluefire m1 issue?"
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I play against Rasant pretty much every time I play so I'm getting quite used to what it can and can't do.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It's very good at lifting heavy backspin and doing it easily, it suits guys that can use the extreme bounce of the rubber to make heavy spin with that bounce, not to go forward, but to make spin with the bounce in diagonals out of the sponge."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Guys that don't hit the ball at 50,000 miles per hour or depend on the blade for spin but rather work with the sponge to get spin."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Good level players that don't hit hard, who can control it, that's who it works well for.I still like the feel of Rasant more than T05, T05 always feels somehow ""mushy"" to me."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Then again I can't really control either  unless I use them on the forehand and I'm not going to do that.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,bump.nobody else?
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I have used BF M2 for a week or so after several years of T05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,(I bought this in a shop in Cologne Germany that is owned by Jorg Rosskopf's brother!)
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Mine is red, max thickness on forehand."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"The bottom line is that M2 is the first "" T05 alternative"" I have tried that is acceptable, this after 4+ years with T05 and after spending way too much money on alternatives that I ripped off my blade in disgust, sometimes after just five minutes of play (see below)."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,M2 doesn't feel exactly like T05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It is a touch slower, and the ball feels different."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Not worse, just different."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It is an excellent feel, though."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Some people have described it as more ""liquid"" and that is about right, as if the top sheet is more pliant."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"The thing is, if you are used to T05, you can play exactly the same way, and play just as well without having to make many adjustments at all."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"You can get the same high arc spins, you can use pretty much the same racket angles."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I have not found that to be the case with any of the ""alternatives"" that have been touted over the last several years."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"If I had to cite differences, I would be that M2 does not feel quite as nice as T05 on blocks (although I certainly made the shot just as well), and it really shines on opening loops against underspin, or counterloops."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It could be that M1 would be better in that regard, I haven't tried it yet.It has a very strong smell -- exactly the same smell as the Dandoy Bio Boost and the Tibhar booster -- and there is no doubt that it comes heavily factory-tuned."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Some people have said that they actually like it better after some of that tuning wears off.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I will report later how that goes.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"But if performance declines, well I will know how to bring it back.Rasant is not one of the alternatives I've tried, so I can't compare."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"But I have tried Hexer, Rhyzm, Vega, Baracuda, Acuda S1, Genius, Adidas P7, and a bunch of others that I can't remember just now, along with a bunch of tensors from the days before I used Tenergy."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,(Back in the day I used Bryce very heavily speed glued).
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Among the non-tensors, Calibra LT was not a terrible rubber, but too fast for my liking."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Some of the Boost series felt ok, but I didn't feel like my shots had much penetration."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,None of these rubbers could really be described as a Tenergy alternative for people who really like Tenergy.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thank you for the write up Baal.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Looking forward to your reviews of M1, M3 and Rasant."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I dont like Ten05 fx, too soft, too slow.Just take a hard, max Ten05, or Raza or HexerHD are also good"
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,M2 is good.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,But I am back with T05.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,In the end I still like it better.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,If money was tighter I would stick with the M2.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I am guessing that I would prefer M1 but haven't tried it yet and don't have plans anytime soon.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I've tried the M1 for 5 minutes and didn't like it  that was because I didn't like the blade / rubber combo, but my team mate & coach & one of the best players in the country decided to stick with it."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"He played it on BH mostly, but in general he alternated between BH and FH in training."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It was really hard for me to play against M1, balls seemed really fast and with good spin."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"In general he liked the rubber, but.. First bubbles showed after 2.5 weeks of playing (~45 hours).I'm wondering how my M3 will be doing (ordered, still waiting for the rubber)."
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Tried M3 my self.
82,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I will not double post, so you will have to read my thoughts on M3 in this thread: viewtopic.php?f=44&t=19868&p=232503#p232503"
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"I have used Focus III Snipe for a while and I got to say that it is a worthy rubber for its price..Haven't tried LKT Rapid Speed though, sorry.."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Thank you.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"Spin Art and Donic Acuda S1 Turbo are radically different than LKT Rapid Speed and Focus III Snipe, the former rubbers being very hard and fast, and the latter rubbers being very soft."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"If you're looking for a budget replacement for Spin Art or S1 I'd look for a hard Chinese rubber that was grippy, not tacky.I really like this one http://www.eacheng.net/index.php?act=detail&ID=2882 but it's inconsistent, speed-wise, from package to package."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,The Xushaofa 999 LSZ starts out tacky but it wears off after a day or so of play.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Rapid Speed is much harder than Snipe.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,I have used snipe and speed on plenty of blades.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,I found that the snipe was better on wood blades and not as good on carbon or hybrid ones.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,The speed didn't have as much grip and a lot of shots went long.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,I would try the snipe if your blade is wood otherwise I would go for the rapid sound if you haven't already bought?
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Thank you.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"I haven't try it with soft rubbers, I will do it next time."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,¿Do you think Xushaofa 999 LSZ is a better choice than DHS Neo Skyline 2 TG2?
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Spin Art is tacky...but Donic Acuda S1 Turbo works better
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Thank you.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,The blade is a Hallmark Aurora it's works very fine with Donic Acuda S1 Turbo but i haven`t try it witn softer rubbers.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,The blade is combi all wood with balsa core:http://www.hallmarktt.co.uk/e-comb.phphttp://www.tabletennisdb.com/blade/hallmark-aurora.html
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"As a former owner of an aurora blade I think this is a blade that you cannot ""go cheap"" with your FH rubber."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Snipe and Rapid speed are probably too slow compared to acuna.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,If you like acuna save extra and go with it.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,In my opinion aurora needs a pretty fast rubber and frankly a heavy rubber if you play LP on BH like I did-its small head size relative to other defensive blades made me feel like I did not have a solid feel.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,That's for sure.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Rapid Speed is actually harder than Tenergy 05; about same hardness as 47 deg tensor scale rubbers.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"Wow you all seem to feel that rapid speed is some kind of uncontrollable, spinless, brick of a rubber."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,It's about as hard as Sriver and has a grippier topsheet.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"MUCH more spin than F3 Snipe (which is easy to control, but a mushy pile of crap if you want your shots to bother your opponent in any way)."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"Despite the name, RS is medium in speed (slow compared to tensors), again, similar to Sriver."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,The feel is like a very slightly harder T05.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,And....what about KTL Red Diamond/Black Power and Galaxy Moon / Sun.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,Also Friendship RITC 729 729-5 ??????
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,People ara talking about Sanwei T-88....Hurricane 2....UMMMMM I'm not sure...
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,I think RS is quite controllable.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,I certainly like it.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,On my faster blades LKT Rapid Speed plays better than fast tensors.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,DHS Neo Skyline 2 TG2 is the tackiest rubber I've tried; a real specialist rubber.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,It requires a lot of power to get decent speed.
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"Spin on serve is tremendous, however."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"I certainly prefer Xushaofa 999 LSZ to any DHS rubber including TG2, TG3, TG2 Neo, TG3 Neo, TA1, and TA3.. all of which I have and have played with a good deal."
83,5f6c2cf07da9e46ccbe155d9,LKT RAPID SPEED VS RITC FOCUS III SNIPE,"Hurricane III is horrible in Hallmark Aurora blade...so high throw angle, hard and only speed when you brush..."
84,5f6c2d1f7da9e46ccbe155f1,Haifu Blue Whale II vs Whale III,"iunno bout the training versions, I have heard many complaints about the poor quality of the these rubbers"
84,5f6c2d1f7da9e46ccbe155f1,Haifu Blue Whale II vs Whale III,the training version of blue whale III is the old version without the red sponge....they are only selling old stock of it!
84,5f6c2d1f7da9e46ccbe155f1,Haifu Blue Whale II vs Whale III,Thanks Leather hey while training in China did you have a opportunity to play with Whale III?
84,5f6c2d1f7da9e46ccbe155f1,Haifu Blue Whale II vs Whale III,What is the difference between: HaiFu whale II National Version Factory Tuned and HaiFu whale III National Version Factory Tuned?
84,5f6c2d1f7da9e46ccbe155f1,Haifu Blue Whale II vs Whale III,No one knows the difference?
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,If you want to chop a lot FH and you are playing people with strong offense you first have to go thinner.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,tacky vs. non tacky is not written in stone imo.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,soft vs. harder sponge Soft = more dwell and more forgiving.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,Harder = more linear/direct crisper with less braking effect.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I have tested quite a few rubbers and You mentioned consistent; a few come to mind for chopping most consistent.Reflectoid1.5, Yanus 1.5 , CJ800 1.8 soft."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,The easiest chopping rubber I used was RITC 2000 tack speed with soft sponge.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,Easy does not mean effective but I hope this helps a bit.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I may not be a chopper, but for fun I have been able to chop really hard and effectively consistently with DHS H3 neo"
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,Thanks =]
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,Soft rubers might have unneeded catapult for defending though..For me medium hard sponge is best.. And semi-tacky (personal preference)..
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I chop best on FH with thinner, softer sponge."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"Seems like 1.9mm or less, with 35 deg or lower softness works best with very spinny topsheet."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I prefer one that is non-tacky or only a little bit tacky so that its not as sensitive to incoming spin.If I go thicker than that, it gets difficult to chop, even up near the table, and I always seem to play better with softer sponge"
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"When it comes to chopping, the best rubber I've tried is Gewo Return Chop, without a doubt."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I tried it in 1.7 mm, and it was fairly amazing."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"The sponge is incredibly soft, and the topsheet quite tacky."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,It had such control I've practically never felt before.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"Right now I'm using LKT Pro XT 1.5 mm because it cost me about half as much, and it also works great."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"Both sponge and topsheet are harder than the Return Chop, though."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"It still offers very good control, and it's a great alternative for chopping and allround play."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I'd recommend a bit more than 1.5 mm, however, if you want to play away from the table."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"Maybe 1.7 or even 1.9.Since I'm looking for forehand rubbers suitable for chopping as well, here are some that I'm a bit curious about before going to the Return Chop:Spin Lord Marder - looks like an interesting rubber that combines mechanical spin with tackiness."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I'm hoping it's close to the Return Chop.729 Fx Supersoft - Well, it's supposed to be tacky, super soft and extremely light."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"Sounds like all the buzzwords I'm looking for.729 Geospin Tacky - If I can find it thin enough, this could be interesting."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"It's not very soft, though, so I'm doubtful.As you can see, right now I'm all about tackiness."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"However I've used Mark V in 1.8 mm in the past, and it offers some control in chopping as well."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"There are a number of great rubbers out there, I think that the most important aspect is the sponge thickness."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,Don't go too thick.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"Then again, I'm new at this EJing, so you should take my words with a bit of skepticism until you see someone else agreeing"
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,I can chop quite consistently while keeping the ball low with 729 cream transcend on quite a stiff blade.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,The topsheet is moderately tacky and the sponge is medium hard and I really have no problem with chopping on the FH with this.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,I think you gotta get used to your rubber and its capabilities to execute different strokes.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"if not T64 and 1.5 mm Yanus Def...LKT proXT with 1.0 mm HRS sponge on Gambler Carbon Oversize is one of the best..also rubbers like Tackiness Chop, Triple Spin-Chop and Andro Backside C , Juic999 Defence with 1.1-1.3 mm (soft, medium -soft) sponges"
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"I currently play with Skyline 3 on the forehand, and I played with Hurricane 2 and 3 for years before this."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,"All of them chop well with practice, but I chose them for their attacking abilities away from the table.Hands down the best inverted rubber I've ever used for chopping, and chopping only is DHS G888.It's a traditional chinese rubber: hard, thick, and super tacky topsheet, and super hard sponge.For a while I had G888 on both sides and I felt like I could chop back any loop, no matter how spinny or fast, using the backhand or forehand.The tackiness, instead of causing the ball to pop up, somehow causes the ball to slow down."
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,It's easy to vary spin between chops and floats.
85,5f6c2d337da9e46ccbe155f8,SOFT vs HARD Sponge for FH CHOP and Tacky vs Non Tacky,Incidentally this rubber blocks easily too but it doesn't give you anything on loops or drives.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"This question interests me too, because my friend is making a decision between these two rubbers.I think that HD must be faster and spinier, but what I want to know most is: how much harder is HD?"
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Know nothing about Hexer but i have used Xiom Omega IV Asia and Pro, on the same tri-carbon blade."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Asia seems to have a noticeably softer sponge than Pro despite the claims to the contrary.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"This is confirmed by the differences in feel, sound, bounce, and dwell time, but i still can't decide which one i like better."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Neither is very spinny until you fully engage the sponge on loop drives.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"thank you big_lou for your respond!c'mon people, nobody else has some info about these rubbers to add?"
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,at least two of us are waiting for your inputs...!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I've only tried the Hexer HD so I cannot compare.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The Hexer HD topsheet feels hard but thin, and it feels like you can't really get the spin until you stretch that topsheet."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,With a softer topsheet (and I assume the XIOM ones are softer) you can get spin more easily but brushing more.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Speed wise I find the Hexer HD pretty quick...
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I would think either would be fast enough.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Hi our top player here uses hexer HD on his BH and OIV euro on FH, on a BBC 7-9-7 blade ( supplied by me ) and he tells me the OIV is faster spiner and less effected by incoming spin."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,He just made semi final of NZ second biggest tornament today.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,He is a big BH player and Andro hexer HD on his BH as it is fast enough with his uper power but the OIV euro to speed up his FH
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Am thinking to to put Omega 4 pro on my FH too.Nice to know tha is spiner and less effected by incoming spin.. .
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I need more informatiom about this rubber.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I heard good things abou Omega 4 pro.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,A lot of the top Victorian players are using Hexer HD.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I don't know of any that are using Omega 4..
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I have to talked to someone that uses Omega 4 in another state and he said it was a fairly good rubber.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Just going off the sheer numbers high rated players that say HD is the best rubber around I would go with that myself if I were using a tensor on the forehand.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"I do know the top sheet on HD is made from a different formula to the other tensors, you can see when it's cut that it's not the same"
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I think a lot has to do with the distributors in the respective states foam.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The Andro distributor is in VIC, and since they let many people try it and spread the word, a lot of people like it and change over to it."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The XIOM distributor is in NSW, and as such it's likely to be more popular there."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"I'm sure both are very good rubbers and suitable for the higher levels, but I don't think we can let the numbers decide which is the better rubber."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"the issue here is not which rubber is 'better',hexer hd or O4, but what are the differeces between HD and Xiom O4 pro & asia in terms of hardness, speed and spin."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,at least this was my intention while starting & defining this thread.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,so please let's try to stay on that course...thank you all for your replies!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,If you are still interested in the comparison Omega IV Pro is faster and spinnier than all Hexers.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,It is a touch too fast especially on a carbon blade and needs solid technique.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The throw while blocking is low which is great and it is relatively insensitive to incoming spin.You could think of it as a Hexer HD with a touch softer and grippier topsheet, a softer sponge , more speed and spin.Like HD you really have to get some bat speed going and engage the sponge is you want that crazy spin.I use OIV Pro on my BH in max thickness."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,thank you ashish!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"i was thinking of replacing hexer hd on my forehand with xiom o4 pro or asia,but as i'm very pleased with hd and i could'nt get any convincing info about omega4 being more suitable for me i decided and ordered a new sheet of hd 2 days ago... but i could not resist trying the new bluefire m1 on my backhand,so along with the new hd i ordered the bluefire as well, to replace my regular hexer although it works for me and i'm quite used to it and like it."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"but, you know,the ej bug..."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I'm currently using Omega IV Pro on my FH.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,It's decent rubber but the sponge is a bit hard for my tastes and so I will soon be switching to Omega IV Europe.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I have had a few brief hits with Hexer HD and found it fast enough but lacking in spin when looping.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Another player at our club (very strong -US2450-2500ish) had a similar problem with it.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Do not use Omega Pro if you are playing with a hard-outers blade, it would be altogether too hard a combo."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Xiom 4 Asia is a very good rubber, being using it for a long time now - in my opinion certainly better than Pro for my style and purposes.Cannot compare to Hexer HD but I am told that it is basically the same as Acuda S1 Turbo just under different brand."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Just posted a comparison for those two in another thread (exactly where they compare S1T and Hexer HD).
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I agree that Xiom Omega IV Asia is a very good rubber but if it's certainly better than the Omega IV Pro?
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I think that both are very similar but the Pro has a softer topsheet!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The top players that previously used the Pro, who tried my racket with the Asia switched to the Asia."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,But after a couple of months they switched back to Pro claiming that Asia was just too hard for their tastes.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,By mistake I got a sheet of Pro and I use it on my forehand and Asia on the backhand.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Both are excellent rubbers!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Topsheet on Pro might be marginally softer but the sponge is even harder than on Asia whcih makes it really hard to do good attacking shots.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,In short game Pro might be better for flipping or non-flat game but that's not my bag (mostly not).
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,So for my style Asia is certainly preferable on both sides.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"But, hey, we all play differently."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia, Well I'm a flat hitter aswell and I really can't feel much difference between the two rubbers.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,The sponge of pro is definitely not harder than the asia( check the hardness ratings).
87,5f6c2d3f7da9e46ccbe155fd,Acuda series vs Bluefire series?,"Bluefire is heavier, has higher topsheet grip, bigger feeling of ""dwell"", a touch slower, higher throw, better for looping, worse for hitting and blocking, sponge is smellier and more porous.I'm mainly comparing S3 and M3 here, but I've used S1-3 and M1-3 and I think it holds true for all the sponge hardness versions."
87,5f6c2d3f7da9e46ccbe155fd,Acuda series vs Bluefire series?,I haven't used S1 Turbo tho.
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,Try Flextra 1.7
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,For classical defense?
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,I was specifically going with Tackiness Chop because it's so dang slow (which is of particular importance since the Joo Se Hyuk isn't a super slow blade).
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"I currently use Tackiness Drive (on a different blade), and it's comparable in speed to Flextra according to tabletennisdb."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,That's faster than what I'm hoping for.
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,Don't rely on TableTennisDB for everything.
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"People have different opinions on rubbers, and your findings will be different from a lot of people."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"I think its better to have a non-tacky rubber for forehand chopping, but thats just me."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"I'm not a forehand chopper, also I'm a beginner, so that makes my opinion a little biased towards my stylel and playing capabilities.Also its cheaper than Tackiness Chop by about 10 US dollars.Keep in mind there are a ton of Chinese tacky rubbbers that play similarly (slow, controllable) to Tackiness Chop for half the price.Cream MRS 1.5 being one of them."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"Unfortunately, my chopping and looping strokes don't work well with Chinese/tacky rubbers."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"While I haven't played with it myself, I know Tackiness Chop is more non-tacky/grippy, despite its name."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"The same is true of Tackiness Drive, which is similar, but a bit more elastic, with a slightly more lively sponge."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"That last part is kind of the problem with my current setup, with regard to forehand chopping, though, and is what I worry would be the same with Flextra; more ""dead"" feeling sponges make forehand chopping far easier, even though it is possible to chop with any rubber."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"one of the best local defenders here uses tsckiness chop 1.9 on a Joo so it can work but note his skill level is high and he rarely attacks, he chops or pushes in a Bennborn like style waiting for an error,if you want to chop and loop also there are better options.The tackiness c in 1.7 shouldn`t bottom out,i`ve had it on a few different blades up to off- and never felt the wood"
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"Yes, my thoughts exactly."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,So I think it's a matter of preference: a little more attacking power and more spin (1.9) or a little more control (1.7).
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"I politely disagree this is a plain bad rubber, dont even know why they still sell this crap."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,Tac Chop 1.7 is fine but if you really want even more control I would say TSP Triple Spin Chop 1.0
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9," Dazzler, just out of curiosity, what style do you play?"
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"I've hit with Tackiness-chop 1.9 a few times, and I'm not sure if I hit any loops in which the rubber DIDN'T bottom out."
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,Not that it's unplayable that way.
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"Use Tackness Chop II, its same speed , and harder"
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"Dazzler, just out of curiosity, what style do you play?"
88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,"I've hit with Tackiness-chop 1.9 a few times, and I'm not sure if I hit any loops in which the rubber DIDN'T bottom out."

88,5f6c2d717da9e46ccbe15611,Tackiness Chop 1.7 vs. 1.9,The throw was so high I had to close my blade to loop backspin!

90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,I used Rakza 7 on my previous blade.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"It's fast, firm, with a high enough throw that makes looping backspin easy."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"Blocks pretty well, and counterloops really well."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"I don't really dislike anything about this rubber, but I've never played with acuda s2."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,I've tried acuda s3 and found it to be a good soft backhand rubber much like a slightly firmer yet more spinney f3.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,Actually I haven't tried rakza 7 on my new blade...maybe I should.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,Which is spinnier: Acuda S2 or R7?
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,Which has more dwell time?
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,I'm assuming R7's slightly faster?
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,I have tried both.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"If you are just at beginner/intermediate level, I'd recommend using the Acuda S2.The S2 is more forgiving than the Rakza 7."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,The one problem from my experience with Rakza 7 is in service returns.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,It has a tendency to bring the ball high which makes you prone to flick drives/smash.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"It's also a bit tricky when trying to use it for chopping.On the blades that I have used, I find the Acuda S2 has better dwell time than the Rakza 7."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"The Acuda S2 for me, among the Donic rubbers, is the all-around rubber."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"That's my standard FH rubber I use when I want to test a new blade and from there, decide which rubber would I use on my blades."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,I have a spare S2 sheet for blade testing.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"when I was using rakza 7, my loops were giving people a few hundred points better than me trouble since I could load them up with spin with plenty of speed."
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,Acuda s2 is faster less spinny last time a played it.
90,5f6c2e3f7da9e46ccbe15632,Acuda S2 vs Rakza 7,"Razka 7 all the way there is no real comparison to S2 R7 is a lot more spiny and thats what you want for an all-round attaker.If you want to be smart, put R7 on forehand and S2 on backhand."
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,"I hate stating the obvious, but since the Tackiness Chop II is designed for chopping, whereas the Tackiness Drive is meant for Driving, the former is probably the better choice."
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,"Tackiness Drive is not that fast though and has good control, so with a thinner sponge I'm sure it will chop very well too."
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,"I have quite a bit of playing time with Tackiness Drive, and also some with the Tackiness Chop."
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,"Haven't tried ""Chop II""."
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,"The original Chop was fine for mid distance chopping, but really hard work to use from long distance."
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,Drive with >2mm sponge was OK for chopping at any distance.
91,5f6c2e5c7da9e46ccbe1563d,Tackiness Drive vs Tackiness Chop II,"For both, I used a fairly slow blade, so ""T-Chop"" on ALL blade may be just what you need."
92,5f6c2e6f7da9e46ccbe15646,Andro Rasant vs. Tenergy 05 fx,Thansk for the share slick..
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Nille, give Rasant a go."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I don't think you will regret it!
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,What is it like compared to roxon 450?
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Is rasant/ calubra a lot faster than roxon 450?Also i'm quite pleased with the amount of spin I can create with roxon?
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Especially on the serves.Has to do with how soft the rubber is, hasn't it?Does anybody know how the other rubbers compare with roxon in those respects?Nille"
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Calibra is very quick but lacking in the spin department.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Roxon is a good rubber and you appear to be very happy with it - why change?
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,If it ain't broke...
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,You have got a good point.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The only thing I am not quite happy about with roxon is that I feel that it's a bit bouncy in the short game.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Maybe that is the case with most tensors?Also rubbers hopefully develop and maybe rasant is better than roxon?I've tried hexer to see if it was less bouncy in the short game.It was, but I found it too slow."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I have used Roxon before and didn't find it especially bouncy.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Maybe it is just a touch issue with you and you have to practice more short-pushing etc and gain some more experience (??).
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I think Calibra and Rasant would be bouncier than Roxon in the short game department.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I don't think Rasant is necessarily better than Roxon - it's just different.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,If you are still at a stage where rubber affects your short-game then I would just stick with Roxon.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I have played table tennis for many years, so I am not a beginner who needs to practice pushes in particular."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Tensors are generally bouncier than older rubbet types.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,No problem - it's tricky talking about rubber sometimes when you don't know where the other person is at (hence my use of question marks).
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,You are correct that tensors are generally bouncier than the old staples but I think it is just something you learn to adjust to after a short while.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,From memory Roxon is somewhere in between Mark V and Rasant/T05.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It's a good do-anything rubber.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,T05/Rasant are better suited if you are an advanced looper/counter-looper.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,This is IMO of course.Edit - Whilst it id not identical with Rasant/T05 I would throw Calibra into the same advanced looping category.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Sorry, was away for a day and couldn't answer."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,My way of describing Rasant would be a similar speed to Roxon 450 with greater spin and better control.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I played with R450 for about 2 years, then went to Hexer Plus basically."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"H+ was an ounce slower than R450 with less ""bounce"" so its control was better, and similar spin."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Rasant has re-instated the speed of my FH back to R450, still with less ""bounce"" but with greater spin capabilities."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I think its awesome, and in keeping with an ""Andro"" feel."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I would totally agree (re Calibra).
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Never played with it, but someone I played last week used it on their FH and the speed of their loops compared to what they previously used (don't recall what that was) was highly pronounced."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"The way you describe it, it sounds as if it's just what i' m looking for then.Better spin, better control, but as fast as 450.My spinny serves are an essential part of my game, and if I can generate more spin, it sounds like a very good alternative."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I tried pryde some time ago, but found it very hard to generate spin on the serves."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"But it is a lot harder isn't it?With roxon 450 i've had max on fh and one step slower on bh, so that would probably be a good idea on rasant as well?"
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It would IMO.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"A word of advice though, I'd change one rubber at a time."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Rasant is harder to get the spin out of from soft contact.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"It took me a little while to adjust and get as much spin on serves, but I feel I have after a few rounds with it."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Thats coming from Hexer+ though.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"If I came straight from the bouncier R450, it might not be as hard to adjust."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Still, I would expect an adjustment period of some degree."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,So it is a bit harder than roxon 450 then?
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Probably is, I couldn't say for sure, simply because I wouldn't think there'd be 5 degrees in it...which means I'd need a gauge to tell properly."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Thanks for your help.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I think I""ll buy rasant, unless somebody has something very favourable to say about calibra."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I know there is a lot of good to be said about Calibra, but I can only say from an opponents point of view."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,That's one step removed from being able to say anything directly about it really.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Kinda like ""hearsay"""
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I finally decided on calibra sound and played with it for the first time yesterday.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Wow, it fler Greta.Roughly the same speed as roxon 450, but control was a lot better."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Spin does not leave much to be desired either.I have always liked roxon 450, but also felt that I lost some unneccesary balls when chopping.Nille"
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Good to hear you found that you liked it Nille.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I'd love to see you find some Rasant to use now to compare it.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Yes, I'd really like to compare the two."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I have used Calibra Sound and really liked it for counter-looping and looping block.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,When you first use it it has a great glue effect on those shots.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I seem to recall that this effect eventually waned but I'm not sure at what stage.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The main problem I had with Calibra Sound was the relative lack of spin.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It's more difficult to get heavy topspin and as a result one gets less dip and the plane of the loop is flatter.I have played with Rasant for 10 minutes or so.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,IMO it is a different type of rubber than Calibra Sound.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The sponge is harder (not super hard but harder than Calibra Sound) and I think (I'm not 100% sure) the top sheet is thicker.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Rasant has better spin than Calibra Sound.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I hope the glue effect Will last for quite some time, sinceStiga's rubbers are usually good quality.My impression-i've only played with it once- is that I was able to generate a lot of spin on loops close to the table as well as on loops further away."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Above all, the control was impressive although it is a fast rubber."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Our experiences differ but the main thing is that you are happy with it.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Yes the Calibra sound has quite a lot softer sponge.
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"The glue effect is very high, I think mainly because with soft sponges the glue tends to feel much stronger."
93,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"My practice partner use the Calibra sound... he can get very high spin but only at medium pace.. since he tend to either play medium pace loops and smashes when he wants to put it away, it works very well for him."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"well the focus 3 snipe is excelent for blocking(BH), insensitive to spin but generates a moderate ammount nothing crazy..you could try either DHS Hurricane 3 or TG3 or TG2 neo???"
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,for FH Tg2 has the lowest trow of the three mentioned
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,Thor's forehand and focus 3 snipe on the backhand sounds like exactly what you need.Thor's has amazing durability.
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"Also, I don't think you will need to tune it as the sponge has a permanent speed glue effect."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,it might go long when you loop though when you first start using it..
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"Thor's has a MUCH lower throw angle than the T88-I, you'll have to take quite a long time to adjust to it."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"Because of how low its throw angle is, I didn't try to play with it for long, so other than knowing that it's pretty fast I can't tell much more about it."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"I don't know much about the Joola Express 2, but the Focus 3 Snipe isn't like any Eurojap rubber I've tried, as it's got a really low low gear."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"Its throw is kinda medium, not really low, and it's really not that light, which was a bit surprising because I was expecting it to be really light."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"IMO Thor's only becomes low throw on power loops or drives, whereas the throw is quite high on brush loops."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"The spin on serves is very good, and it's indeed very durable when you look after it."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,How non-linear is Thors?
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,How is the spin sensitivity?
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,I often drop the ball short on the FH side on slow spinny serves to my FH.
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,Will Thors affect my ability to do this?
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,Despite being able to generate high level Hurricane 3 spin close to the table and Tenergy 05 spin away from the table it is much less sensitive to spin.
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,The short game is excellent also.
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,Those short pushes to the forehand you do shouldn't be a problem.
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,Now that our season has finished I am trying Thors as a new fh rubber.
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"I had a first session with it yesterday, and am quite optimistic for it; I'll write a review after a few more sessions, as first impressions can be deceiving.One thing that won't change though; it is pretty heavy."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"If you are trying to lighten your setup, this may not be the one for you."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"T88-I is nowhere near Focus 3 Snipe.My T88-I is really spinny, nearly matches my Venus 2 36 degree (spinniest rubber I ever have, exceeds H3 or anything else, even T05)."
94,5f6c2ec57da9e46ccbe1566d,Advice needed: Thors vs T88-I & Express 2 vs Focus3 Snipe,"The black Venus 2 is spinnier than the red one, more consistent in quality.Focus 3 Snipe is butter-y soft, mediocre spin, bouncy, bottoms out easily."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,H2 Blue is probably the best for you out of those since you already use H2 regular.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"From what I understand, the Skylines don't hit or block well at all, but both varieties of H2 are quite good for those strokes."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,Ye im planning the h2 blue sponge.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,i would just like to know what the difference of TG2 and 3 were
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"I have and used them both.TG2 is harder, slower and more tacky.It has higher throw and seems to be spinier on slower shots.Blocking is ok, counter is average."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,(not the most consistent though) I use it on BH
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"Well, TG3 is much better performer when you are further away from the table."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"You can easily brush loop, power loop.....just about any loop."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,I agree that it's not an easy hitter.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"Blocking is great, counter is very good too."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"Pushing is not as spiny (as with the TG2)I dislike the TG3 on all my blades except on my Hallmark(tried it on KC, Tube Carbo and Iolite) I don't recommend this one to be used without EEII, or speed glue."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,With EEII it changes completely and becomes very lively
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,TG2 is among the heaviest rubbers I have.TG3 is about 7gr lighter for the same cut.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"Now I have two TG3 with completely different sponges.My review is based upon a TG3 with a smooth, softer yellow sponge.I haven't cut the other one yet."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"If you have any particular questions, just ask"
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"well, i know H2 is a spinny rubber."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,good spin on short games and openings.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"so if these facts r true, what does that make skyline?"
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,so simply TG3 vs H2
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"Last time I checked skyline, the TG2 was softer than the TG3."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,The TG2 I tried glued up and it made a nice very spinny looping rubber.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,I have not tried the TG3.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,The TG2 also makes a very nice allround rubber in 1.5mm.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"TG3 was hard, dead and enormously sticky imo."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,This was glued up too...
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,so you're saying that it was a bad rubber?
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"or what else do u mean by ""dead""?"
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3," Mine TG3 is not that dead, compare to my TG2, not so sticky either."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,Though the orange sponged TG3 is way harder than the cream sponged one(tg3)Both TG2&3 are begging to be used with EEII
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,wow everyone with contradicting information.I just bought some tg3 hoping it plays better than the tg2 I couldn't use.If it is hard I doubt I can adapt to it either.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,A softer tacky rubber possibly easier to use than spin art (well because its an 1/8th of the price)
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,In the Neo series TG2 is harder than TG3.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"The rest is as Kolev reported.Imho, TG3 is the best of the Neos: H2, H3, TG2, TG3, though most players prefer H3."
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,I'd categorize H2 and TG2 more as specialist rubbers due to H2's ultra low throw and TG2's unusual hardness and tackiness.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,For the moment I have a red TG3 Neo 39° and a black H2 Neo 39° on two identical blades.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,Although they play a bit different I can't say for sure which one I like more.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"H2 seems to be spinier, but that could easily be my imagination.Meanwhile I have tried H3 Neo, but couldn't fall in love with"
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,......and just to add my opinion.
95,5f6c2ee47da9e46ccbe15680,Skyline TG2 vs 3,"I really prefer the feel of 999Nat above the aforementioned.Not that tacky, but superb overall performance"
97,5f6c2f317da9e46ccbe156ac,Chop & drive vs butterfly tackiness chop 1&2,"comparing tackiness chop 1 to chop and drive,to me the feeling was unclear with chop and drive it was like a marshmallow on the blade,i got good feedback with tacky chop,but there is only so far you can go with these type of rubbers the modern rubber s give more spin with less effort and you will struggle to stay in the game against these in the hands of any competent players"
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I think both rubbers would be good for you, although the sponges on them could be a little soft when playing hard attacking shots even in 2.0 or 2.2mm."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Maybe the Giant Dragon Taichi would be better as it has a slightly harder sponge?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Or possibly even the hard version of it with a thinner sponge?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"The submarine would certainly suit the style your describe... the 1.5mm a bit more control for chopping, the 1.8mm a bit more offensive potential."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I've not tried the allround either, but it will obviously be at least a little faster."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I can highly recommend Spinlord Marderfor your bh.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Very good spin and controland insensitive to spin.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,http://www.ttdd.de.deIf you don't chop much 1.8 or 2.0mm will suit your game.I haven't tried submarine but it certainly soundslike good pick as well.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,cheersGeddk
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Hi,Some of my clubmates use submarine and one uses marder."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Submarine is somewhat more solid feeling and has more power reserve while passive it,s slower off it can be more dangerous."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Marder is more fragile, lighter, with thinner base for the topsheet."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Both are nice but on harder off blades I found submarine can be more effective for a miscellaneous game.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Marder I only played one trainingsmatch for testing tough so impression is brief.For submarine I guess 1,5 for allround, 1,0 more defence tendency and 1,8/2,0 for more offensive tendency but 2,0 more for fh or longer bh stroke ; For me not quick enough for bh not spinny on chops and pushes either."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I played 1,8 myself for a few months on bh."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"1,0 several sessions and trainingsmatches (same type of game with off blade)."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"1,5 version only short tested on other players bat was a good medium, most allround for me."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"If I - possibly -buy it again for myself it,s going to be 1,5.More serious chopping 1,0 is better but I would use a bit softer blade then."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Galaxy w-6 or something in that range or also all round and defensive blades.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,You can chop with it as if digging a hole in the floor then (for maximum spin) or chopblock close at the table.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Specifically a black 1,0 version worked well for this.1,8 is better for bh opener with a longer arm and in open play continued loop-attack from mid distance."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"It needs to follow through more, too much for me (the allround could be better for that when it has same topsheet with a faster sponge)."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Over the table spinny opening brushloops 1,5 is better."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Quicker, better, response to me for wrist."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,And attacks from mid distance can use the blade ; Just whack the ball with enough spin to land works well.Due to topsheet all versions play relatively thick.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"1,0 feels more like 1,2 or even 1,5."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"1,5 as 1,8 ."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Topsheet is not typically slow but allows good dwell for ""catching"" the ball under attack for a spinblock and reverse spin, chop or anything."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Short dropped spinblocks putting the ball where I want had superb control for sharp angles and length.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Also parallel (important for me as a lefty) or as a short stopblock.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Not much spinsensitive for this but decent counterspin gives a sharp enough bounce and second dip.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"1,5 I found most balanced thickness for this but other versions worked well also.Some susceptibillity comes in offcourse when pushed further from table nailed at bh side by a strong off player."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Continuous chopping is not real strong and save option then (on an off blade).
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Counterattacking not real strong either.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"But in 1,5 all these things are possible.But, in general, continuous variation becomes key ; Chopblocks, keeping ball flat and low with some pace, a halfhigh lobspin, as spinny as possible, use of sidespin, corkscrew and whatever comes in mind.More heavy chops on occasion also."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"With enough and continuous variation, if possible some deceptive use of wrist, most opponents can be triggered to make ""mistakes"" or offer chances for fh."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"The reason this is succesfull with this rubber (to me, maybe helped by playing lefthand) is that all these strokes can be done a bit more agressive then usual thanks to good control."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Not giving to much time and always some spin that seems to be difficult to read.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,It becomes almost a long pips game then except pips are reversed to lp inverted and you have to be active for the deception (as with grippy long pips).
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,No idea how the allround compares (curious for that as well) but submarine is the only rubber where I could play such a game without feeling too handicapped for a more standard attacking game.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"It needs a fh rubber that also allows to stay close to table ; flatter throw, not too fast but hard sponge, tacky rubber is perfect for me to combine with.A so much fun game that I think it deserves this try for a review."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Great review ghrasp!
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Thank you all for your responses.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,It seems as if no one has been able to try Giant Dragon Allround.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I'm interested to know if it does indeed have the same topsheet as Submarine.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,It sounds like Submarine in 1.5mm might be my best option for my backhand if I want the ability to switch seamlessly between offense and defense.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I really appreciate the advice so far, and I welcome any more you can provide.I just received a sheet of Reflectoid 1.5mm to try and I can already tell with a simple bounce test that it is substantially slower than my CJ8000."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I'm excited to see how it chops on my Timo Boll Spirit tomorrow.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,If I can't mix in over the table attacks with it I'll have to try something else.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Submarine and Dr. Neubauer Domination 1.5mm are the only two choices that seem to come highly recommended for my style of play.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Who knows, I may decide to be the first Guinea pig for Giant Dragon Allround."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I haven,t tried reflectoid."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,It has similar idea from reviews but must be different then submarine because of weight difference.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Reflectoid is extremely light and submarine is medium.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I suspect this will give submarine the edge for shielding off the fast bounce from an off blade with a tangential stroke and keeps the ballcontact a bit longer (to be able to do something in critical situations).
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Spinlord marder could be in between (at least weightwise it was according to ttdd.de site when they still sold reflectoid) with lighter topsheet then submarine but heavier sponge then reflectoid.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Reflectoid, as with marder, I expect to play better on somewhat softer wooden blades in off- range for instance the w-6 (also nice headsize for chopping) or modern defensive blades."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,The light weight avoids a too headheavy setup then and for fh attack these blades become better (quicker response) to stay at the table.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,For less headheavy handling but also the throwangle on fh can be kept flatter under pressure.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,More flexy blades behave stiffer and quicker when the setup is less headheavy and can be played more agressive with.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"For instance Tenergy and the likes (high throw, heavy) with reflectoid bh will still play well enough for blocks, smashes and counters at the table with keeping same time a good looping abillity."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,At both sides these rubbers need faster blades for that
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,isn't 1.5mm always best for that requirement?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I use therefore cj8000 1.5mm on BH with a slower blade and it fits me perfectly.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Switching SEAMLESSLY is just what I do, increasing spin stroke by stroke (in contrast to Polina  http://www.laola1.tv/en/int/tischtennis ... 0138-.html )"
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,What 1.5mm sponge do you use under CJ8000?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"purple sponge 36-38° (""extreme spin"")"
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Is that a Palio pre-made option, or did you get it custom made with that sponge?"
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"it's premade from ttdd.deanyway, I did not want to focus with my posting on cj8000."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"my message was:no matter what rubber use, guess it's one out of sriver, coppa, cj8000, submarine, quattro, high super, marder, neos, 007, higher, geospin, ... i'd always prefer 1.5mm for an allround-game with defensive and spinny offensive shots."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I think you are right, it's just a matter of finding the best 1.5mm for my game."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I appreciate the advice.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I tried Reflectoid 1.5mm and it was ok for chopping, but the offensive capabilities were not good enough for my game."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I'll have to keep looking.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,There are a view different topsheets for palio cj-8000.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Standard and three versions (A, B and C).Extreme speed, extreme balance and extreme spin use the A,B and C. Don,t ask me which is A and which is C but extreme balance is in the middle so that would be B."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Sometimes also offered as cj-8000 spintype, speedtype aso."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Spintype has longer more supple pips making the topsheet more flexible.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"while speedtype has shortest pips.Their is some simillarity with submarine but if extreme spin is C then submarine would be D : ""extreme control"" with even more supple topsheet."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Submarine is less tacky, red almost none-tacky."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Less linear katapult therefor a wider range of gears.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,This range of gears (similar as Hurricane III has) makes it possible to vary between defensive and offensive shots but also has higher risk for being caught in between.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"1,5 is certainly the best entry and most allround but 1,0 has more contrast to fh, and additional control allows to be more active with it at the table making it nastier for opponent."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I may misunderstand you here, but are you saying Submarine is less linear than CJ8000?"
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,One of my favorite qualities of CJ8000 is the linear way in which you get what you put into it.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,I am not a fan of surprises such as a medium speed swing resulting in an unnaturally fast shot.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Predictability is important to my style since I so often switch between chopping back loops and hitting them as well.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Do you think Submarine has a tendency to lose it's linear quaility when swinging very hard?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"I suppose you could mean that it has a wide range of gears, from very slow over the table shots all the way to very fast smashes."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,This is a good thing as long as it does not become unpredictable.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Is this what you mean?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,That Submarine seems to have a wider range of gears than the CJ8000 variants you have tried?
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"If you hate Hurricane III maybe don,t buy or try."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Hurricane III is predictable (after a while of use once you know it well) but far from linear as how japanese classic rubbers are linear ; Submarine has a wide range of gears also and it,s very variable from this once you know it well for alternating between attack and defence."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,But shifting gears needs some feeling with it.As with hurricane you can easy disconnect to the katapult (it seems to have none then).
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Deliberately this is perfect for an alternating game.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,But it can also happen accidental at times.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,It has more risk for that.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"Then it,s maybe not as forgiving as palio."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Maximum spin on pushes against backspin is not as good as with palio.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Probably because the topsheet of palio has more powerfull pipsstructure.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Less air between topsheet and sponge.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,"This is why palio is heavier also.Counterspin, backspin or topspin this is less powerfull."
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,A pointscoring attack with submarine needs slamming the ball with a punchblock technicque that contacts the blade well.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,A faster blade supports that a lot offcourse.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,It only needs little opportunity for this.
98,5f6c2f397da9e46ccbe156b1,Giant Dragon Allround vs Submarine,Somehow there always seems to be enough spin coming with it for the ball to land.
99,5f6c2f4b7da9e46ccbe156bc,Joola Smart Rubber vs Mark V,"supposed to be a medium hard, grippy, ALL+ rubber."
99,5f6c2f4b7da9e46ccbe156bc,Joola Smart Rubber vs Mark V,never played with it though.
99,5f6c2f4b7da9e46ccbe156bc,Joola Smart Rubber vs Mark V,but he could get LKT XP or XT for really less.
99,5f6c2f4b7da9e46ccbe156bc,Joola Smart Rubber vs Mark V,if you tell what he wants we may suggest you something
99,5f6c2f4b7da9e46ccbe156bc,Joola Smart Rubber vs Mark V,what about joola smart rubber i wanna but that

100,5f6c2f977da9e46ccbe156f0,"G666 vs. 64 on chopping, differences?! !?",Both G777 and G888 have rock hard sponges (harder than Hurricanes and Skylines); and I believe G666 has the same sponge.
100,5f6c2f977da9e46ccbe156f0,"G666 vs. 64 on chopping, differences?! !?","If you are coming from soft sponge Euro rubbers, it will take some time to adjust."
100,5f6c2f977da9e46ccbe156f0,"G666 vs. 64 on chopping, differences?! !?",Both G777 and G888 are also very sticky/tacky (more so than H2) and are good at producing spinny services.
100,5f6c2f977da9e46ccbe156f0,"G666 vs. 64 on chopping, differences?! !?",I've never used G777 but G888 is a lot harder than G666.

101,5f6c2f9c7da9e46ccbe156f3,729 Cream Transcend in 1.8mm vs. 2.0mm,I even tried cream on transcend at 1.5 for a while and could not attack with it off the table at all.
101,5f6c2f9c7da9e46ccbe156f3,729 Cream Transcend in 1.8mm vs. 2.0mm,So if you want control go with 2.0.
101,5f6c2f9c7da9e46ccbe156f3,729 Cream Transcend in 1.8mm vs. 2.0mm,"If this is your first ""real"" paddle the limit of your control will be the tacky topsheet and not the sponge thickness."
101,5f6c2f9c7da9e46ccbe156f3,729 Cream Transcend in 1.8mm vs. 2.0mm,If you are worried about controlling the tacky topsheet and it is your first non-premade paddle I would go with a 1.8 thickness six shooter from gambler-not too fast and not tacky.

102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,1.7 is enough.
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,Even if you use a Sweeper 1.7 will be fine.

102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,There's a big difference between the two.
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,"The 1.9 has a lot less control than the 1.7, certainly in the red version."
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,That one is rock hard and needs very good technique.
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,The black 1.9 is a little softer and a little more controllable.
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,"I don't know what thickness you're using now, but if your technique isn't optimal, then the 1.7 is more than good enough."
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,The 1.7 has a lot of control and you can do everything very good with it.
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,"If a loop is needed go for 1.9 , if chop is more important , than probably 1.7."
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,"I chop easily with 2.1 and give lot of troubles to my opponents.Anyway, control is a very relative thing"
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,Im currently using hurricane 3 provisional 2.2 and chop consitently so i guess 1.9 should be fine or should i go with 1.7 then when im comfortable jump to 1.9Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,"it depends on the blade,1.7 sponge version will be easier to chop with on most blades,but for effective topspin it might not work so well on stiffer blades .I use tenergy 05fx 1.7 and it fits best on donicdefplay,the looparc is difficult to make on anything stiffer than allround classic with the thinner sponge"
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,Thanks i guess i will have to go with 1.9Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk
102,5f6c2fa67da9e46ccbe156f8,Tenergy 64 1.9 vs 1.7,"Yes, I think if you are using a 2.2 Hurrican already, a 1.9 Tenergy64 will suit you."
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,Hey there Nagatito Maybe you need to check out this awesome thread first.viewtopic.php?f=44&t=3906
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,I thought that the HD was a tensor hehehe.
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,But what is the difference between tensors because i see that are 1g 2g 3g 4g 4.5g wich is the difference
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,Have you also read this thread in its entirety?
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,viewtopic.php?f=44&t=17024HD is a tensor.
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,The difference between 1st generation through to later generations is basically development of technology and durability in the rubbers.
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,The earlier tensors were prone to oxidisation of the topsheet and also cracking/crumbling at the edges badly.
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,"Old tensors came with a sticky protector sheet to help prevent the oxidisation, whereas newer tensor don't now because they have solved the problem."
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,Later tensors have tended to have more speed or spin built into them too.
103,5f6c2fab7da9e46ccbe156fb,Hexer HD vs Other Tensors,Yeah i have read it but there is no comparison between those rubbers at least I didnt see it
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"The Jupiter is both harder and faster, so you should use the faster rubber on your more attacking side."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,I deffinitely prefer harder rubbers to go on my forehand side.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"On the backhand side, I want to be able to spin the ball with more ease."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,This is difficult with harder rubbers.Just make sure you do reviews of the rubbers so everyone gets your impressions on them.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,Today I received my new Jupiter fresh from Haggisv and with great eagerness I put it on.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,My skill at putting on the rubbers must be getting better as it wasn't nearly has hacked as last time and was nearly a nice oval type shape.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"Complete with edge tape its come up pretty micky schmick.My set-up is as follows: -Blade: Sunflex Hurrican (sic*), no idea how its rates as its an old premade for about $25.FH: Red Jupiter 2.2mm 38degree 43 hardness (whats the difference anyway??"
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,)BH Black Mercury 2.2mm 36 degree unsure of hardness but assuming around the 40 mark.Beware if looking for some meaningful information from this post as I have little experience in rubbers so really haven't much to compare to.The first thing I noticed was that the rubbers both seemed really jumpy compared to my current 729 Super FX Lightening.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,I did hit a few long but this was soon fixed by hitting with a more closed blade and hitting through the ball more.The feel was a bit more dead than what I am used to (perhaps contradicting the above) where I can often feel the contact with the blade but with these rubbers it was only on the real power shot that I could feel and hear the blade.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,Maybe this is the extra thickness of the rubbers I'm not sure.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"It didn't bother me but was a bit different.The speed off the bat didn't seem to be any faster however the Jupiter advertises that it zings off the table and it certainly did seem to do this with a noticable kick.I'm trying to develop my technique for looping and found that these rubbers actually helped me do that, perhaps if I didn't, the control wasn't there or perhaps the spin wouldn't be generated to keep the ball on the table.The one thing I can't really tell is if these differences are the blade, the rubbers or both.Since tonight was just a friendly hit, I didn't do any spinny serves to see if they seem to generate more or less spin on the serve.I'm considering using the new set up on the next comp night but not sure yet, might have another practice first, after all whats the point of being an apprentice EJ and have a custom bat and not use it."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"Later on, if you want more punch in your strokes when I would recommend 729 bomb to you.Very cheap and versatile blade  You have to be very careful when you take mercury 2 off your blade.Sponge is very fragile.I bought 4 pieces and I have regret itLkt rubbers, like xp, xt is much better for your bh in my opinion.CheersGeddk"
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,that crumbly sponge that seems to snap is quite common with Yin-he rubbers
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,I've now taken my set-up to the club a few times and its sparked a bit of interest.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,A few A grade players who are a lot better than me had a go and actually have all commented that the Mercury II (black) is faster than the Jupiter (red).
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"In fact, they felt very fast and combined with a fast blade would be 'dynamite'.Apart from playing, one just tapped the ball up in the air several times and the extra height off the blade was visibly noticable for the Mercury II.Its very interesting as I've been using the Mercury on BH and Jupiter on FH since I thought the Jupiter was faster."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,Didn't really trial the other way as I just took it for granted but now perhaps I'm going to have to go the other way.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"There lies the problem to define which rubber is faster...The Jupiter has a much harder sponge, whereas the mercury II has a soft springier sponge."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"On low impact the mercury II will feel more lively and can generate pace with less effort, but when you start looping hard, the sponge will bottom out and your speed comes from the blade not the rubber."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"The Jupiter sponge is firm enough not to bottom out, and at high impact will still generate good speed and spin even on a slower blade."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"in other words, for the Mercury II the power of the blade will come into it much earlier than that for Jupiter, and the Jupiter can generate good pace without the aid of the blade, whereas the mercury II will run out of puff, and at high impact you'll get the speed from the blade not the rubber, which usually means you won't get much spin either as the sponge 'bottoms' out.So which is the faster rubber?"
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,it all depends on your definition of speed and how you use the rubber...
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,Interesting comments haggisv.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"Perhaps like beauty, speed is also in the hands of the beholder."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"Maybe rather than just doing little bounces on the bat of say 15cm or so, perhaps another test should be done where we try hit the roof of the building."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"Using this extra force and higher bat speed, perhaps the blade would have more impact and the Jupiter produce more speed and therefore more height.If the blade were a DEF blade, could this bring the test back in more of the Mercury II again ?"
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,Lately after I put on new rubbers I like to stretch the remnants to see how much tension is required to snap the rubber/sponge.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,I have noticed that MercuryII/MarsII break remarkable easy (I think I also did this with Moon but I can't remember).
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,Whereas 2008xp and PalioCJ8000/Quattro take much more force....
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,I'm talking a very big difference.
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"The Yinhe rubbers snap almost immediately, the others mentioned have to be stretched so much you'll probably get some sharp backlash on your fingers.I haven't used the MercII or MarsII long enough to know if this physical property correlates to durability; but I find it interesting."
105,5f6c30157da9e46ccbe1573b,Jupiter vs Mercury II,"Also, I rarely hit my paddle against the table so I don't have any feedback in that regard."
106,5f6c301f7da9e46ccbe15741,Calibra LT Vs Bryce speed.,Read this thread: viewtopic.php?f=44&t=17026
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Well the Flextra is definitely slower.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"The Tenero is not an awful lot slower, but it's very soft so gives plenty of control."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"The Coppa Tagora is a bit faster than Sriver, but also nice and soft so great control."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,All three rubbers will make for a good beginner setup.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,If you can find a sheet of Nittaku Magic Carbon I think you would quite like it.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"I don't think it's really slower than Sriver, but it's higher control and plays nice and soft."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,They discontinued it long ago but there are still sheets out there.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,I would choose the Coppa Tagora.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"I don't find the Flextra good for much at all, apart from spin and insensitivy to spin."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,The Tagora is quite spinny and offer good control and decent speed.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"Well, this is the first time I'm respectfully disagreeing with our good buddy haggisv."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Haggis!
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"I just played with Coppa Tagora, then I fixed the guys paddle (and bounced the ball on it a lot) and it's an amazing rubber (was 1.7mm) but I do agree it is a bit faster that Sriver!"
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"And our new friend wants something a bit slower than Sriver.Yasaka offers nothing slower than Mark V. Butterfly Sapphira is a bit faster than Flextra, with more spin."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Butterfly Tackiness chop is not as slow as some accuse it to be.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,It's very good and we have two good attackers who use it.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,I used it for 10 years.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,It is about 5% slower than Flextra and 10-15% slower than Sriver.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,The guys who use it for an Allround game don't miss much.Nittaku Spiral in a 1.6 is a bit slower than Sriver but much spinnier.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Same for Tibhar Vari Spin.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"Nothing wrong with disagreeing on something glennholder, we all perceive things differently  IMO The regular Coppa is similar speed to Sriver, and the Tagora is a little slower."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"I've played with the Coppa Tagora for several years, before that I played with Sriver FX for several years and the Tagora was definitely a little faster, with the empasive on a little."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"Bottom line is that both rubbers are really similar, with the difference being that the Coppa Tagora is quite a bit cheaper (5-6 euros).Erm, so it's good for giving spin, but it's also insensitive to spin."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,That's not possible.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,LOL I had to laugh when i read my own post    I meant it's good for control and insensitivy to spin.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Lol the way i read it i thought you meant it was good at generating spin and insensitive to oncoming spin from the opponents shot which sounded pretty darn good to me.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,"Okay now as far as some of the other choices mentioned, i couldn't find the Magic Carbon anywhere."
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Same with Bty Sapphira.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,As far as tackiness chop wouldn't that be too grippy for a starting rubber ie too sensitive to oncoming spin?
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,Nitakku spiral and Tibhar vari spin seem like another couple of viable options.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,As far as Donic coppa Tagora is concerned I was more interested in Tenero as i read that it was the slower out of the two.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,I suppose i could get one of each and use the Tagora on the FH but thought that in the beginning it might be easier to use two of the same rubber or at least two i know would have the same throw angle.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,The Tenero should work well too...
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,The Tenero is a bit softer and therefore a bit slower than the Tagora.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,It's also a great rubber.In the end you will not go wrong with any of the rubbers named in this thread.The only difference would be that if you still have a lot of trouble dealing with other people's spin you might go for the Flextra.
107,5f6c30207da9e46ccbe15742,Butterfly Flextra vs Donic Coppa Tenero,If you are more interested in adding good spin of your own then go with the Tenero or Tagora.

109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Baracuda is spinier as well faster better rubber
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Can you tell me about the weight difference between Baracuda and Acuda?
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Which one is lighter?
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,I would guess the Baracuda would be considerably heavier.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Can anyone who played with Baracuda and Genius compare these two rubbers?The same comparison between Tibhar Sinus and Donic Accuda would be much appreciated .Anyone?
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,thanks a lot.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Personaly I prefer genius over barracuda.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,It seems that barracuda has a bit higher throw.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,But both are quite close.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Porous sponge.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Very durable rubbers, natural rubber topsheet."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"They are fast, very spinny and have a quite good control and feeling."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Andro hexer is another competitor, same generation rubber, as spinny, but lower throw and a bit faster, better for blocking and hitting.Weight in 2mm : between 65 and 70 grams.Acuda is the next generation still with porous sponge but not as porous."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Therefore it is easier to stick it on the blade which is a good thing.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Still quite natural rubber, but maybe slightly more synthetic."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"I only tried acuda s3, too soft for me."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,It still has a high throw.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,It is a bit ligther.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Sinus is the previous generation, with normal sponge, more dynamic, very fast, but less spin, and durability is not as good."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Quite low throw.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,A bit lighter also.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Thank you speed29 for your detailed reply!can you just specify what type of Genius did you play with?as i understand there are 3-4 of them(regular Genius,Genius+optimum,Genius+optimum sound...) thank you."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"I played ""regular"" genius barracuda and hexer, not the softer ones.ESN, the german manufacturer, released a new generation to compete with tenergies."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"High pores, natural topsheets, good speed, very good spin, very good durability."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Donic barracuda, tibhar genius, andro hexer, joola x-plode, xiom vega pro.And later : softer versions of these rubbers : joola x-plode sensitive, genius sound, hexer powersponge."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Smaller pores, softer.At the same time yasaka released rakza 7, a hard rubber."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"A competitor for genius and others, but not as porous."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"It seems new released rubbers sponges are not as porous now, but still porous."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Topsheets are still of good quality, quite natural, but less natural I think, a bit softer."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"They also released rakza 7 soft, comparable to joola x-plode sensitive."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Acuda are comparable to these rubbers, about same release date."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,Acuda s1 and rakza 7 are competitor for the first mentionned rubbers.
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Acuda s2, s3, rakza 7 soft are softer and slower."
109,5f6c30387da9e46ccbe15753,Baracuda vs Genius and Accuda vs Sinus,"Thanks a lot speed29, great information!"
110,5f6c30427da9e46ccbe15758,DHS Hurricane 3 vs DHS Hurricane 2,"The main difference between the two is that H3 has a higher throw, making it a little easier to loop with, whereas the H2 tend to be a little easier to block or counterloop."
110,5f6c30427da9e46ccbe15758,DHS Hurricane 3 vs DHS Hurricane 2,"Both have quite a 'dead' feel and are tacky, which is quite different from Euro-type rubbers."
110,5f6c30427da9e46ccbe15758,DHS Hurricane 3 vs DHS Hurricane 2,"Perhaps you could consider the Hurricane Neo series, which are softer and more lively, which is quite a step closer to harder sponged Euro type rubbers."
110,5f6c30427da9e46ccbe15758,DHS Hurricane 3 vs DHS Hurricane 2,"If you are really looking for a Chinese rubber that is closer to the style of euro rubbers you should really look into Dawei Inspirit, or Saviga."
110,5f6c30427da9e46ccbe15758,DHS Hurricane 3 vs DHS Hurricane 2,"They are much much closer than any of the DHS stuff, other than possibly Tin Arc WHICH WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR A REVIEW OF!"
110,5f6c30427da9e46ccbe15758,DHS Hurricane 3 vs DHS Hurricane 2,mine is on its way hopefuly only a week left ( tin arc and Tin arc 3)
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"i had experience with darker vlon-s silver v, but not the newest one which came on market recently."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,i had also experience with three versions 729 cream transcend the 729 cream transcend i've got was not best in terms of consistence.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,the transcend sponge was pretty hard as well (it has not like transcend sponge on 729 higher which was medium hardness).
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,i think it was bad batch.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,i have better opinion of new cream (sponge marked 43 degrees).
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,cream MRS i've got had much softer sponge than transcend or new cream.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,it was consistent as well and powerful on spin(older MRS was famous but MRS has changed and it is not the same; transcend is still very good in medium hardness but does not thrill me when hard)old vlon-s silver v...i was not thrilled.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"it had not big weaknesses, but it did not excel either."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,ok rubber.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"what i did not like was that it was little springy on lower gears, thus losing a little on control."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"personally i'm not fan of such rubbersyou can try new cream (eacheng sells it), it has lower throw, is consistent, and has harder feel (if this is ok with you)."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"tack on cream is semi-tacky, similar to hurricane neos, with overall spin not that strong but much easier to control."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,better than cream transcend.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"or, you can try new vlon-s"
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"Thank you, I'll buy a new Cream then."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"Btw, between New Cream and 729 Highpoint, which has lower throw angle and better control?"
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,LKT Black Power and LKT Red Diamond are EXCELLENT Chinese rubbers with a almost Japanese like topsheet and low throw angles and plenty of power.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"I have played with Cream Transcend and Dawei 2008 XP, and these LKT rubbers have a lower throw than Cream which has a lower throw than the Dawei."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"it's true about LKT, i've tried red diamond and throw angle was pretty low, lower than any cream's."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"but since i don't like too low a throw, this was a put off to me"
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"Wow, thanks for the info."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,But what's the difference between black power and red diamond?
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,Black Power has a lower throw angle than Red Diamond.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,It's possible that LKT was doing a similar thing that Juic was doing with Couga.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,Both Black Power and Juic Couga (which also only comes in black) have very low throw angles and both are commonly recommended as very good backhand rubbers.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,"Red Diamond has a low throw angle also, much like Butterfly Sriver, but the price is only 40% of the price of Sriver."
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,I found Black Power and Red Diamond to be slightly faster than 729 Cream Transcend and slightly slower than Dawei 2008 XP.
111,5f6c30467da9e46ccbe1575b,Dawei 2008 XP vs Darker VLON-S silver vs 729 Cream Transend,But hitting with the Black Power and the Red Diamond had more control.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I've used Rakza 7 for the last 5 months.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"I use red, max on my forehand."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I really really like this rubber.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I like to topspin attack over or just behind the table on my forehand side.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"I find it gives plenty of spin (dips late and hard), control and enough speed and it's lasted well."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,For me it doesn't have the springy feel of a lot of typical euro rubbers and so I find I have better control with it and I like the feel of the sponge (hardness wise).
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I can definitely hit and smash and topspin with it and I find it good for blocking too.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,It's not overly reactive to spin but again technique will help you cope with incoming spin as much as the rubber.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"I can use the rakza away from the table looping but for me it's better nearer the table where I find it really excels.However, I lent my bat to a friend who uses tenergy 05 forehand and backhand and has done for a long time."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"He felt the Rakza was ok, nothing special, certainly not as much spin for him and he preferred his tenergy (tenergy to me feels quite mushy in comparison to the Rakza)."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Somebody else who has borrowed my bat and also uses tenergy 05 / 64 thought the Rakza was more springy than the Tenergy he used but after a few minutes trying it out he quite liked it - but not as much as his tenergy.Never used hexer, sorry."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,You might want to also consider the new Palio Blitz Soft (42*).
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Very spinny and fast yet surprisingly resistant to incoming spin.. an effortless blocking rubber.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I would have similar comments to Debater about Hexer Plus.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I haven't used normal Hexer and I haven't used Razka 7.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,My teammate has T05 on his FH and Hexer powersponge on his BH.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,He has that setup for similar reasons to what you are seeking.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Thanks for answers.I'm in dilema, again RebornTTEvnglist can you tell me more about Hexer PS, and is your teammate happy with it?"
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Also, can somebody give me a site where i can buy Blitz, i heard it is cheap so i'll give it a try."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Rakza soft is faster than Hexer, a better one for attacking."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Hexer is a little more grippy, good at blocking, serving and short play."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Rakza is not bad at this though.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Hexer has a higher throw, more difficult to attack from mid distance."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"Both are very good rubber, I think Hexer last longer."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Rakza got a little tired after a month or two.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,My Hexer worked nice on a Stiga NCT Allround but not on my JoomSe Hyuk.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"You could also consider Xiom Vega Europe or Omega IV Europe, little softer and more control, and higher throw than Rakza."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Xiom's harder rubbers (pro-version) could be what you need.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Both my teammate and I have used Hexer PS.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"He has a different style to me, he's more of a brush looper."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"I found it to be a good medium throw rubber (normal Hexer is higher throw as def-attack said), but not as fast as the other Hexers, but only marginally."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Enough that opponents noticed my smashes were just a little more possible to return than Roxon 450 though.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"The advantage Hexers have over Roxon is they are not as bouncy though, so FH push and chop is easier to control.My teammate had HPS on both sides for quite a long time and his game developed nicely with that."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Very spinny and well fast enough.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"He switched his FH rubber to T05 and got even more spin, but kept with HPS on BH still and when he is hitting confidently the shots he rips from his BH are out of sight!"
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,He is most certainly happy with it.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,He actually went to it from normal Hexer.My switch from HPS to H+ gave me back a little more speed (still not quite Roxon level) and maintained the control properties of Hexer.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,It also suits my style with a low throw.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I wonder how Rakza compares on speed with Roxon 450?
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,I have used both Hexer and Hexer+.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,They are quite different.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Throw is much lower on H+ and it is softer and faster.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,But the topsheet on hexer is more grippy.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"i never liked H+, never figured out how to loop with it (used it for about 2-3 sessions)."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,And I really liked the grip of Hexer .
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"I went to T64 1,9 mm from Hexer 2,1 mm and got more speed and a lot more control, especially when counterlooping, looping and fishing from distance."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"My first sessions with T64, it felt like I could not miss anything, whatever I did, the ball landed on the table ."
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Chopping was MUCH easier than with Hexer.
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,Too bad it is soooo expensive  .
112,5f6c30507da9e46ccbe15761,Hexer vs Rakza,"But I got almost the same feeling with Xiom Omega IV Europe (2,3 mm), very good control and spin and enough speed for counters and looping from distance."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I am currently using H2 Neo and also TG3 Neo.H2 Neo is firm, fast, and spinny."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Its throw is low.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Great for close to the table play.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Control is excellent.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Blocking is excellent.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Starts tacky but mostly wears off after 5-6 matches.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"H2 Neo is my main rubber at this time; my previous rubber being Tenergy 25.TG3 Neo is firmer, faster, and spinnier."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Higher throw than H2 Neo.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,More spin on serves and loops.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Less control overall, and seems to work better on slower, flexier blades.These were both purchased from FastPaddle.com and came in packaging that indicates hardness."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,They are not provincial or national variants.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"In a nut shell, H2 is the biggest gun in the DHS gun rack ie for the most offensive players, TG3 is the best overall and great on blades like P500, Primorac -off of anything with a bit of bend in it,TG2 is similar."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"H3 is a more dynamic and much less stable version of H2, it doesn't seem to really have anything special going for it that can't be done better with TG3"
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,What CHinese rubbers have you tried Skippy?
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"None of them are going to feel as lively as your XIOM or Andro rubbers, but they are some very good CHinese rubbers around."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,H3: allround rubber.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Can do anything, but nothing greatH2: battleship."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Most demanding rubber, but gives back the most if you can get it out."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,To hot to handle for meTG3: medium between H2 and H3.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Very fast, and very good for topspins, bot close and medium range."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Nowhere near as demanding as H2.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,My choice
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Well, I have played very well with the Hexer+ on my forehand, and Vega Euro on my backhand, but here lately I have been playing with Hexer+ on backhand and Globe 999 Natty on my forehand cause I liked how soft the Hexer+ felt on my backhand while at the same time having nice performance."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I put the Natty on my forehand to ""slow down"" my forehand and control the table a bit more."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I don't much care for H2 cause the throw is just too low for my liking.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I liked my H3 Neo and had the most significant win of my life playing with H3, but when I hear people describe the Skyline 2 as like H3 with a slightly softer topsheet that makes me think it would be a nice performer for me."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"My drawback from the Hexer+ on my forehand isn't so much that I can't hit a slow loop but that it just seems a much more difficult shot to pull the trigger on, and the shot is more difficult."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,The 999 Natty probably slows down my forehand a little more than I want it slowed down however the slow loop is so easy a monkey could do it even without opposable thumbs.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,The Hexer+ speeds it up a little more than I would like.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Would the 999 Turbo, or Skyline II be a better choice as an in between of these two?Oh, by the way Haggis, I've played All varients of Globe 999 and t, 729 SP, Higher III, Geo Tacky, Cream, Dawei Inspirit, Saviga (inverted), H2, H3, Venus, Venus II, Six Shooter......"
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I probably liked the SP, Globe Nat, and H3 the most out of the Chinese rubbers I have tried."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Hmmmm?
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Compared to the Hurricanes, the 999 topsheets are softer and more elastic, making them a little slower but more spinny especially at lower impact."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"The 999 Nat is quite slow and dead at low impact, but when the hard sponge kicks in at higher impact, it's quite fast."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"The JUIC 999 CHN and JUIC 999 Turbo are fast at lower gears, but not quite as fast at the highest gear, although they are spinnier for faster loops."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"The 999 Turbo is about 15% faster than the 999 CHN, which is probably 20% faster than the regular Globe 999."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I'd suggest you look at the old non-red sponge version of whale.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"It's far closer to a glued up 999 national than any of the neo hurricanes/skylines.Incidentally, I hated skyline."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Ridiculously slow.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Those were the regular versions though.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I tried the BWII and actually really liked it quite a bit, but the tuning barely lasted 2 weeks on the sheet I got."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,The Chinese need to figure this out so that the performance doesn't change so drastically when the tuning goes away.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Heck if the tuning would last 3-4 months the sheets are well worth it.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,If it's only 2 weeks I dunno if it's worth it to me especially since from batch to batch Chinese product varies so much.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,How good is the quality control for Haifu?
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I have the bluesponge Skyline, and it's very good."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,At least 15-20% faster than Globe 999 nat.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Barely slower than h2.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Globe, H3 and TG2 are more suitable for your controlled brush looper, they aren't really stable enough for a power looper, TG3 and H2 are much better there, more stable and more spin when you are full tilt, Globe might give you more on the low end but runs out of spin at 80% arm power, H2 will go all the way with you, TG3 goes somewhere in the middle."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"H2 doesn't make much spin on slow shots but it makes the most spin of any Chinese rubber at the very limits, TG3 is nearly a middle man."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"You can compare them to you are blue in the face and I have, but in the end the do everything man, TG3 is always the best most of the time"
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I agree.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"At high speeds H2 is a monster, but it's hard to get it there."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,And it's a difficult beast to handle at slow speeds.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,TG3 is so much easier to play with and you still get very good results with it.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"It has a lot of spin, and you can drive all day."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I really couldn't do that with the Globe 999 National.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Where is this bluesponge Skyline sold?
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Is it considered Neo?
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,It's not neo and it's sold by Eacheng and some other companies
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"Yes its commonly sold in China and HK, It's 38/39 degree not the softer version that you can get in a packet"
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,Is the Skyline topsheet noticably softer than the Hurricane topsheet?
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I'm currently kicking around about 3 or 4 rubbers as a possible forehand rubber.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I want fairly high throw (hopefully consistent throw), pretty long dwell, great spin, decent speed, preferrably a tad softer than Hurricane so that if I have to hit passibly I can still manipulate the ball pretty well without heavy engagement on the ball."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,It seems like the harder chinese rubbers have to be actively striking the ball to get the spin and speed.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"The other rubbers I'm looking at are Tin Arc, 999 Turbo, Thor's, Skyline II Neo, H3 of some sort."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,i think skyline 2 neo would suit you.. i found it very easy to generate spin ( used on clipper wood) and the speed was there as well.as for the top sheet being softer i cant remember all too well.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,but i think it was around the same if not harder
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,"I have TG2,3 Neo."
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I could say both topsheet are firmer with more elastic than Hur.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,I feel they spin and catch the ball better than Hur topsheet.I think they are better than Hur.
113,5f6c30527da9e46ccbe15762,Hurricane vs. Skyline Trainwreck,(comercial to comercial ones)
114,5f6c30707da9e46ccbe15777,Palio Thor vs Palio Blitz,If you like tacky rubbers better the decision is already made for you.
114,5f6c30707da9e46ccbe15777,Palio Thor vs Palio Blitz,"Blitz isn't tacky, Thor's is."
114,5f6c30707da9e46ccbe15777,Palio Thor vs Palio Blitz,"Sure you can chop with Thors and make alot of spin, there's only one problem with your plan and that's Thors only comes in a hard max thickness sponge so it's never going to be a proper chopping rubber, Blitz in the softer 42 degree 2.0mm sponge would be heaps more chopper friendly"
114,5f6c30707da9e46ccbe15777,Palio Thor vs Palio Blitz,One more thing I forgot to ask are these rubbers better on a soft or stiff blade thanks
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"i use TG 2 Neo on my clipper as a demo blade( shakehand) along with TG3 neo on the other side, and the rubber feels great tons of spin and perfect speed( for me anyway), like my sig says i use H3 NEo, which is a good rubber, but ive come to adore the TG2Neo but i cant have it on my Cpen setup as the rubber wont fit( since its cut for shakehand)the way H2 was a spin demon Tg2 neo takes after that first time i used it i was baffled by how mush spin it created and ease of use, way more spin than Normal H3 and still a bit more than H3Pthe TG2neo is easy to controlleven on a fast blade like Clipper, but like with most tacky rubbers you cant play passively with them, you need to engage the ball if you want to keep control.as for BH i use Galaxy sun which is quite fast and with the right stroke low and explosive shots against backspin are possible with its high throw..im planning on testing a sheet of DHs TNT for BH its meant to be quite lightalternatively you could get one of the non/lightly tacky 729 rubbers..as for blade i find stiga allround + H3neo + Galaxy sun light enough, no pains no strain"
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"for the RPB rubber, you could just attach it short onto the blade like the FH rubber."
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,this gets at least 5G off the bat.
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"but with any hard sponged rubber like a hurricane or skyline on a Cpen, you can count on it to be heavy."
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,cos real C-pen players play with Huricanes
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"The Rakza I have now is cut short because it used to be my forehand rubber, so no help there.And the weight is not a problem because it would cause me pain or make me get tired before but I just can't get my strokes through as well as with a lighter bat."
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,It's hard to explain but especially when my hand gets sweaty I feel I cant get a good hold of my bat and dont follow through properly.
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"try to dry your hand before every serve as well as the rubber... tacky rubbers my Hurricanes dont perform at all then sweaty, they need to be dry..i just breathe at it close up and wipe till its dry with either my palm or shirt or shorts, getting rid of dust and whatnot.and as rule of thumb you wouldnt use huricane as BH rubber at all"
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,I think I never said I was using hurricane as a bh rubber.
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"apologies i misread,did a little test today and the h3p was surprisingly decent for rpb, and the sun was heavy on the spin"
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,rules of thumbs for tacky invertedALWAYS use a tacky rubber film for tacky rubbers.ALWAYS use body weight transfer with the traditional chinese tacky rubbers.ALWAYS clean after playing.
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,NEVER use sweat (unless its pushblockers sweat because that makes it tackier)AND ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use it in black.
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,ALWAYS IN BLACK +1 !!!

115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"If you like what you have Aaron, why change?"
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"The rubbers you suggest will add a little weight, but with a fairly heavy blade you may not notice the difference as it will be balanced."
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"I think H3 Neo will feel a lot different (harder) to the Tibhar rubber though, so you may lose some control with it."
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"Wow woow wooooow  Oh boy, are those OX?"
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"Apart from my frustration, I would second RebornTTEvnglist and add that going for a chinese you must be ready for a big change in your game"
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,actually most of them are playing with skylines now for some reason.
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,maybe they hold the globs of glue better?
115,5f6c30867da9e46ccbe15788,DHS Hurricane 3 Neo provincial vs Skyline TG2 Neo commercial,"going on the weights can help to :p, if there arent handy you could use 40mm HE-PF rounds"
116,5f6c309b7da9e46ccbe15798,stiga boost vs calibra ?,"These Boost and Calibra series have given STIGA a lot more credibility in what has always been their Achilles Heel; rubbers.Boost enjoys a good reputation, but Calibra is really hot-to-trot at the moment."
116,5f6c309b7da9e46ccbe15798,stiga boost vs calibra ?,"Lots of players like and use it, both the regular LT version and the Sound."
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,"definitely bigger holes.i can't imagine why anyone would want Blitz much softer-but I guess I do favor the harder sponges myself.let us know how it plays, but i expect it to be high quality like original blitz"
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,"Haggisv, Is the 42° version defensive?"
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,"Cheers, Ma'man"
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,No I don't think so.
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,"The packaging, and therefore the description and ratings, are the same."
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,Has anyone reviewed Palio Blitz?
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,What is it like?
117,5f6c30b97da9e46ccbe157aa,Palio Blitz 42def vs 47deg,"I'm sure there are some reviews on the original Blitz... like this one:viewtopic.php?f=44&t=12615&p=137170Since I have not been playing lately, I've not had a chance to try the new soft version yet."
118,5f6c3130220a4650ffffd9bb,Donic A'conda soft vs Butterfly Tackiness C?,Quite evenly matched rubbers and both relatively durable.
118,5f6c3130220a4650ffffd9bb,Donic A'conda soft vs Butterfly Tackiness C?,Tackiness C is too slow to open loop... counter-looping is only possible on fast loops.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"In China, when the humidity was so bad, the walls and cieling dripped and the table was wet right after wipeing it down, Outlaw was completly useless."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Sriver FX worked well.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,H-3 National was OK.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Nothing was immune.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"mm yeah after I had the ""this is crap"" reaction about outlaw hen everyone else was raving about it, I figured that it was due to the humidity."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"Outlaw was the worst I've come accross too, but luckily in our climate, high humidity does not occur often.999 seems to perform well under all condition.... never had a issue.Pimple do not seem affected at all"
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,sort of like a treaded tyre?
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,mmm Now that would be interesting.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Imagine if Michelin (via Cornilleau) made a tabletennis rubber version of their Pilot Sport car tyre?
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,What would that be classified as?
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Different versions with the tread running up/down and left/right?
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Asymmetric so you get different effect on each side?
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Directional for looping?
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"I'm in the habit of cleaning rubbers with water then running them across the nearest smooth edge, door frame, towel hanger etc."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"Even most tacky rubbers slip beautifully across edges when wet and squeegee themselves dry, Thors wont and it's really annoying for me because that makes it hard to get the water off it quickly, it just shudders across the surface gripping onto it."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"As you would expect from having such an annoying tendency the side effect is that it's better than most in humidity but still losses quite a lot of spin when wet, it's playable but still takes the sting out of your shots."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Lucky I don't have to deal with this problem since it's almost never humid here.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Only sometimes when practicing over the Summer break.I don't often use non tacky rubbers but the rapid speed/soft/sound etc topsheets were really unplayable in those conditions
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"Less tacky rubber which depends on mechenical spin (Eruopean Type) which has more dwell time, potentially should be less affected by moisture."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"But, tacky topsheet and comperatively hard sponge rubbers should be more affected with moisture/dust."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"T50 topshet feels less tacky if you test with your fingure on the topsheet of T50, but it grips the ball very well because of it's softness/ long dwell time."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"So, potentially it should less affected with moisture, dust and swet on it."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,I am with Silver.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,Xiom Omega II is crap in humidity and gives me an edge in summer when I face opponents using it.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"Problem is, when I use Outlaw in summer, it is 10x crappier."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"So, Haggisv has it right when he says 999 topsheet is king of conquering the humidity."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,My 999 on Quattro is a standyby in summer and never lets me down.
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,"tackier rubbers seem more waterproof on the topsheet, im comparing H2 and H3, 729, sriver FX and cream."
119,5f6c315d220a4650ffffd9d8,Inverted Rubber vs Humidty,maybe this is connected to outlaws worthless performance in humid weather.
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,I like the rubber.
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,I have only used the black in 1.9 soft version and it seemed very linear to me.
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,"What see is what you get, or some such."
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,I am using it on a very slow blade (Leidy Wave U-S-B) and the control is superb.
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,It is a great counter point the Giant Long when I twiddle and punch block with it.In the for what its worth category: I thought the packaging was excellent.tOD
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,"I agree, the name is what caught people's attention... now that the Tenergy myth is dispelled, the interest has dropped, despite this being a pretty decent rubber.I would think OOAK Shop will carry this rubber, and prices would be similar to something like the Hurricane Neo, in the mid twenties (AUD$)."
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,"Interesting, Im looking for a good backhand rubber with those properties."
120,5f6c3164220a4650ffffd9dd,TopENERGY vs T05 vs Roxon 450,Thanx for review speedplay.
121,5f6c3169220a4650ffffd9e1,Inspirit vs Inspirit Quattro vs Inspirit Quattro UL,Ur topsheet will be thinner and the entire sheet will be lighter and a bit spinnier.
121,5f6c3169220a4650ffffd9e1,Inspirit vs Inspirit Quattro vs Inspirit Quattro UL,Even Inspirit Quattro does not say Quattro.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,calibra and moon pro seem quite similar to me( only a brief hit with calibra) but the speed and catapult seems quite the same.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,perhaps moon is a tad faster
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,"firstly, Bryce without glue is slower than nianmor and calibra."
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,faster esn is slower.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,"Nianmor, faste resn and calibra aren't anything like t05.hammond throws higher than bryce but is more or less interchangeble.Bryce is more durable than hammond.drum = h3729sp transcend is much sticker than h3."
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,plays differently.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,1.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,Friendship Faster ESN has zero similarities with Tenergy.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,This rubber is about 4-5 years old.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,It's a classic Friendship 729 topsheet on an old soft ESN sponge.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,"Today's ESN sponges have far better performance and the Chinese Topsheet is way too thick, hard and stiff for the soft high catapult sponge."
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,2.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,Friendship Transcent SP has zero similarities either.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,It's similar rubber to Faster ESN except that the ESN sponge and the SP topsheet are better.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,Without speedglue this rubber is too slow and hard to play.3.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,"Galaxy Yinhe Moon isn't the same as Tenergy 05 (less performance), but those who like Tenergy 05 will also like Galaxy Moon and feel at home after a short bit of time."
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,The loss of performance is acceptable because the rubber is more well rounded than Tenergy 05.4.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,Giant Dragon Superspin G3 is probably the best Chinese replacement for Tenergy 64.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,This rubber is well worth a test for those who like T64.
122,5f6c3179220a4650ffffd9ec,T64 vs Blast vs Desto F1,"thanks for the answers, that really clears things up."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"I have tried them both, but a long time apart and on different blades."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,Sterco sponge is quite soft and a lot less springy compared to the T64.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,I would guess they are similar speed.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Throw of Sterco may be a little lower, but it's not really low."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Sterco is a lot less sensitive to spin, but not quite as spinny, although the spin on Sterco is good and the topsheet very grippy."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Sterco has little glue feel, much less than T64."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,I have tried both Sterco and T64.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"To me, both rubbers are basically same speed which surprises me quite a bit as I expect the T64 to be that much more faster."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,The Sterco is not exactly soft either.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Well, not as soft as I would expect it to be as it is only slightly softer than the T64."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Spin, the Sterco is not as spinny as the T64."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Control wise, I believe the Sterco is better."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Yep, Sterco certainly don't have the glue feel to it."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"In fact, it feels a bit dead which is why it surprises me with the speed."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,It can pack a punch too with my driving smash.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"All in all, a good rubber and quite durable as well."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"For its price compared to that of T64, I say it is better value if spin is NOT an important part of your game."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"In fact, for lower level player, I would recommend the Sterco over the T64 for its better control.Cheers."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Just received a package of Sterco, quite excited to pit Sterco against T64, since T64 is very expensive."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"I don't expect any glue effect on Sterco (unlike T64), but as long as it's easy to play with, that's fine by me.Will do a comparison in a few sessions' time."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,Sounds good Yuzuki!
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"Sad to say it's still quite different -- granted, Sterco is rather fast and grippy, so it's an interesting alternative.But it doesn't have that 'glued-up' feeling I've become too used to, because of tuning and speedgluing.In a brief sentence, Sterco doesn't lose out on speed nor spin (very interesting!"
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,"), but the gears and feel are quite different."
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,It doesn't do the 'suck the ball in and spit it out' kind of feel of glued/heavily tuned rubbers.More to come after I tune the bejesus out of this sheet.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,Where can I buy the Sterco?
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,Avalox Distributors.
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,You can see the list of distributors here:http://www.avalloavx.com/distributors.htm
123,5f6c318f220a4650ffffd9fa,Avalox Sterco vs Tenergy 64,Thank you.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"WOW, Great review speedplay."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,U are always so thorough.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Thanx.I feel obligated to say before I comment, that I will probably become a reseller for Air and a few other brands."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,So my comments maybe should be viewed as less objective than normal.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Althoough they are always a bit subjective The rubber is Air Illumina X25, they cost about 25 $ at Colestt.com."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,But I think hes sold out at the moment.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I actually think the rubbers I sent u was 2.2 mm sponge, its the only thickness ive got."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I havent had troubles with the durability on my own sheets, they are just fine, but my friend played with his sheets a lot on a Btfy Primorac, he played really well too."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,But one of his sheet was not looking at all good after a few weeks.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,He tore off a peace from a jagged edge in anger.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"But I would say that the durability normally seems pretty good for these sheets.I agree with this review, most of it is right on."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,This rubber is a bit of a speed monster.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Smashes are terrific.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Spin on power loops is excellent.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,I had troubles controlling these rubbers in the short-game at first.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,They felt very sensitive to incoming spin.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"But I think maybe some grip wore off, or I simply got used to it I dont have that trouble anymore."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Though Im a bit surprised u would compare it to a short-pip.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,But another guy on the forum wrote about this and he had similar findings to u.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"So I guess they are rather insensitive to spin, at least after a while."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Besides my trouble was mostly with a black sheet.This rubber though, is a real peace of work."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Sponge is 40-41 degrees and u have to engage it thouroughly for the looping to be really spinny.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Very euro rubber, but with a bit softish topsheet, but with a much harder pip structure than Scirocco rubbers."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Alot of catapult from this rubber.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Though it is also awailable with 36 degree sponge.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Called Illumina X90.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Havent tried that one.Edit: Hmm not sure about the pip structure.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,But the topsheet is clearly thicker than scirocco sv (the thinnest Air softest scirocco rubber).
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Its clearly harder and more offensive altogether at least.I first tried them on a Stiga Off Oversize.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Being oversize and the rubbers are heavier than avarage.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,The setup was 195 grams.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,But it was quite good.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,I think I needed the wheight to power through this rubber.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I can play really good with this setup, but its very hard work."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Its all or nothing.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,No slow loops or such.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"When not pushing, I have to constantly flathit, powerloop or smash."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,This setup does all this really well though.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"But its too heavy for me, really, and too much work.Ive also tested the X25 on a BBC All+ blade on the bh, and its very nice."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I have to be right on with timing to be able to loop well, but the strength of this rubber on a lighter blade is clearly flathits and smashes, again very good.Maybe later Ill to try them on a medium-heavy off blade."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Would be interesting.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Why not a Wavestone, its 152 mm wide, at least wide enough for me to hit the ball."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,This rubber is surely not for everyone.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,But it is very good for what it does.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"But for most people, maybe including myself, a Scirocco Sf or Sv would be a much better choice, good looping rubbers, with excellent control."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Much, much slower though.I have to say reading speedplays review I got very interested in the almighty T05."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Ill have to try that one some day.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"But since I play good with Air Illumina, I might have trouble with T05  ."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"But I dont think so, I think I would like it very much, based on waht u wrote.Over and Out // the Wookie"
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I know too little about tuning and tuning effect to be of any service here, sorry."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"The problem might also be that the tuning effect is wearing off, and the rubber is shrinking, causing it to come loose from the blade."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Speedplay, I saw a lot of the same things you saw about Illumina.- Difficult to keep on blade."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"This rubber curls like a maniac leaf- Very Spinny, almost T05 like, ball drops off cliff- Very Loud Corking sound- Very Very Slow on slow strokes."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,It really pissed me off in that department.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,I expect SOME bounciness.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"You are right - it is almost Anti rubber-like dead.- Rubber felt ""Strange"" on loops, not very linear."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,That shows all the signs of a heavily tuned (possibly overtuned) chinese rubber.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I know many have had problems gettin the sheets to stick, including Cole, but all the Illumina sheets I have glued have stayed on."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,The later batches are supposed to take care of this and other problems.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"""This topsheet has a very soft, euro feel with traditional euro pips structure."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Extremely spinny without being sticky at all.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,The sponge is sort of lemon yellow...extreme corky speed glue effect.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,New version is fixed to glue and stay glued better.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"X88 was by far my favorite of the types, so much so I've decided to simplify and just carry that type."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Sponge is around 41 deg.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,I've never carried a rubber even close to this good.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"X88 topsheet is thinner and lighter than previous versions."""
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"- Cole ElyThe X88, X80, X30s series should be more of looping rubbers, as Cole suggests, with thinner topsheet.Im actually enjoying the X25 more and more though."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,Works very well on my All+ Bladesbycharlie blade.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Light, and not too offensive."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"Loops are ok too, but they have to be quick.Last sunday in the series I played three of my singles with this bat and won all."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,I played two with my other bat and won one.
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,"I feel quicker with a lighter bat, and Im liking the Illumina rubbers."
124,5f6c31a0220a4650ffffda04,Air Illumina (FX25?) and Roxon 330 vs Tenergy 05,I think Ill change it to my primary setup for now.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I tried Tenergy but can not justify the price.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I still have a sheet on a W-1.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I use it once in a while.

125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I averaged about 2 months of great play out of T05.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,The third month was always still pretty decent.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,The fourth month it really changes.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I actually get much more time out of the tensors.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,When people talk about durability being great with T05 I have to assume it's cause if you knick the table with the T05 you might not neccissarily tear the rubber sheet whereas if you look at most of the tensors the wrong way a few mm of the rubber flakes off the outer edge of the rubber.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I do think the tensor sponges stay livelier much much longer than T05.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I still use illegal rubber rejuvenator which really keeps the topsheet grippy for a tremendously long time.

125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,"But that lasted only 4 weeks or so and T05 became more ordinary, possibly partially because it deteriorates and partly because you get used to it.Like you I use PME and am happy with it."

125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I don't think it can break down at the molecular level.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,I know tenergy shrinks over time.
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,Is it possible that the sponge has some form of expander in it which slowly evaporates over the first few months?
125,5f6c31ac220a4650ffffda0b,How long will Tenergy 05 last? Tenergy vs. Palio Macro ERA?,That might explain the loss of performance and shrinkage.

126,5f6c31b5220a4650ffffda12,"729 GeoSpin Tacky, black vs. red, question","Hi gh,General rule of thumb is that black rubbers are tackier than red rubbers and red are faster than black, something to do with the red colourant!As regards GSTacky, not a massive amount of difference between the 2 as both are very tacky, but a little as above."

127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,That's strange that such a relatively older rubber would seem to outperform Vega Euro in both speed and spin.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"Makes me want to try yanus df  Please share what your coach tells you about the ""smother loop""!"
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"Nice name for it by thy way, around here I think most of us have been calling it a ""guide block."""
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"It hard to figure out sometimes why Chen/Hou decide to play this shot rather than a chop or a counterloop, but it does seem to be quite effective at times!"
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"Yes I am still a bit shocked that the yanus still performs so well, I think it might be the blade that has some effect on the Vega and my Combi effect is 2 years old and a bit dead now, I need to buy a new one but at $ 280 NZ I need to brace myself first.I not sure she called it the smooth loop, I just made it up."
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,Because that it looks like to me.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,I will get the pro's name for you off her.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"But she did explain that it is spiny controlled side spin shot that makes the opposition lift up their return which you either attack or chop the stuffing out off.Regarding new shots, it has taken 2 years of coaching to be shown any new shots."
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,Like most Chines Professional they try to get the basics really good first but I think she just got sick of me asking so she is teaching me new stuff anyway.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,Maybe I could start a new topic somewhere about new stuff ( advanced ) she is teaching me?

127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"I don't think a second ""water gluing"" is likely to change the performance much... that rubber may simply not be such a good match for the blade..."
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"I remember Achim from Re-Impact try to explain to me how the catapult of some blades and rubbers can work against each other, which is why the T05 just does not seem to perform on the Tachi...."
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,I tried it and he was right.Many tensors just don't feel that crisp on a balsa blade.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"Please do, that would be a real treat!"
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,+1
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,Greggy these newer versions of ESN rubbers will seem to be lower performers to the earlier generations of tensor rubbers.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,They have dialed back the bounciness considerably starting with the Vega series rubbers.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,The complaint of the Tensors to Tenergy was they are too bouncy to have a really solid short game.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,The Tenergies are bouncy but were able to be slowed when they needed to be.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,The Vega's were some of the first new ESN rubbers that if you were used to the previous generation tensors you would actually feel as if you took a fairly large step backwards in terms of speed cause you could produce a great deal of speed with very little effort out of previous generations of tensors.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,The short game was far more difficult in those previous generation tensors.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,This is what they are really trying to rectify.
127,5f6c31bf220a4650ffffda19,Xiom Yanus Df vs Xiom Vega Europe on Balsa,"Well, that and durability."

129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"When I pick a rubber1, I want it to be good a backspin serves and the Razka has good spin for my backspin and sidespin serves2, I want it to produce top spin (not my main requierment but important) I can loop at the table or away3."
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,I want to be able to smash the ball and the Raz is great for that 4.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,Return of service is a extra bonus as I didnt put it as high (when I used Joola ex2 or globe 999Nat) No chips or damage with over 3 months use
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"No you're not, just look at your signature if you need a reminder of what you're using  SOunds like Rakza is quite durable..."
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"I've heard mixed reports on the Vega... some says it's very durable, some sya it doesn't  Have you already tried these rubbers, PeaceGuard?"
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe, what do you mean?
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"lol shhh just changed it Mind you I have seen a player with a big bubble on thier Razka7, but I have had no problems"
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"No, I haven't played with any of them yet.A bubble may result from bad gluing or something like this, I don't take it as a serious threat.Xiom's have an opinion of extremely durable, Rakza also."
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,It's just Vega Europe which is very very soft and it may result in a bit worse durability.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"Whichever I'll choose, I'll probably be playing longer than I should with it, I mean for about 1,0-1,5 year."
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"That's why I care so much about durability.I should prefer Vega, because of the price difference, but for some reasons I'm still more convinced of Rakza."
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,Hey Peace guard!
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,!I have been using yasaka R7 for quite some time now.since i use it with T05 i can compare it with that and tell you.really high back spin and side spins on serves.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,on side spins it actually floats in the air!
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,!serve return really good as well.Backspin-R7>T05sidepin serves-R7=T05.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,but R7 floats during side spins.serve return-R7>T05.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,since R7 is bit slower than T05.i use R7 in my back hand.i mix my serves with R7 or with T05 just to confuse  .
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,"since both have different spin properties, but R7 can produce heavy backspin.Loops and Loop drives[b]-R7 is slower is loops but produce very good spin."
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,loop drives are really quick and low with R7.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,can loop any back spin easily.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,T05 is fast in both.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,but T05 jumps bit higher during loops and drives where R7 stays low.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,[b] smashes and shots with less accuracy [b] its a breeze to smash with R7.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,i dont have to be careful at all.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,every ball goes in even if it has a variety of spin.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,but T05 is unforgiving.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,i have to play a really perfect shot to smash.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,that makes me miss a quite few balls  [b] durability [b]- R7 is as good as T05 in durability.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,but if we reglue it very often it domes a bit.but there is same amount of power after putting it properly on the blade.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,better to use Haifu water based glue and not Butterfly.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,because with butterfly you cant take the glue off the rubber and chips the rubber everywhere when you try.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,I think R7 would be a good combination with Soft carbon since the rubber is hard!
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,might give u enough speed and spin with control.I dont know how good i am in table tennis.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,Interestingly for the first time i played with Alex [b](haggisv) for the first time this tuesday.A very nice guy to talk and i dont like his bat.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,because he got pimples on one side .
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,may be he can judge me how good i play.
129,5f6c31ea220a4650ffffda3a,Yasaka Rakza 7 VS Xiom Vega Europe,last winter i played in DIV5.cheers

131,5f6c31f0220a4650ffffda3f,Donic F3 Big Slam vs. 729 Super FX-EL vs. Gambler Reflectoid,"Maybe a Palio Macro Era, 42,5 degrees with a bit thinner sponge is what you're looking for."
131,5f6c31f0220a4650ffffda3f,Donic F3 Big Slam vs. 729 Super FX-EL vs. Gambler Reflectoid,"It's softish, loops well, and can hit quite well."
131,5f6c31f0220a4650ffffda3f,Donic F3 Big Slam vs. 729 Super FX-EL vs. Gambler Reflectoid,And it's relatively cheap
131,5f6c31f0220a4650ffffda3f,Donic F3 Big Slam vs. 729 Super FX-EL vs. Gambler Reflectoid,Switching myself from SP FH I prefer harder sponge.LKT Rapid Speed 1.8 has very nice control in smash/drive hits.

132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"For comparison, Red Hk1997 Biotech 2.2 is 42g.I have replaced the CJ8000 on BH with Mark V Max for the Yasaka Extra 3D as whilst it plays nice I have more punch with the MV."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I am going to try and source some 39-41 and 42-44 hardness and try that.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I might even try it with a custom sponge, any suggestions where I can get really good custom sponge?"
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I had a look on ColesTT and the Quattro looks to be the best so far.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Its a really good rubber for the price, tremendous grip/mechanical spin and good control."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I would give it a 9/10.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,39-41 and 42-44 hardness is currently only available in Chinese sponge which plays entirely different from the Japanese.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I hear you on that!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I've been goofing around with a sheet of 0.8mm Neptune LP just to get a better understanding of how to play against it.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,More and more at clubs I've been facing LP blockers.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Time for me to crush them!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I do like how I can block topspin smashes with LP and send back knuckleballs.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,The frustration of opponent hitting net nonstop is priceless.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I know!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I'm usually on the receiving end of these damn LP blockers!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Been playing CJ8000 J sponge for a week now on OFF+ blade.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Prolly got 10 hrs under my belt.Conclusion?
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,My initial worry that it wasn't high enough throw is now put to rest.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Once I got used to playing with it, things went well."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Great for FH powerloops and smashes!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Yes, the throw is much lower than T05, but the confidence in landing my powerloops is high."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Hitting with full power on FH loops causes ball to shoot forward straight and then dip down very low and hard with a somewhat unpredictable high jump.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,All my opponents have said it's more difficult to read the spin off bounce compared to when I played T05.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"T05 was spinny but more predictable for opponents, hope that makes sense."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I was forced to play with compact stroke since I don't want to overshoot the table, just let the spring sponge do the work."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"This limited my ability to vary the shot, whereas the speed/spin of CJ8000 can be manipulated by me with fuller stroke without appearing like I'm doing something different."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Make sense?
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I think it's the soft sponge.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Gives me more time to manipulate the shot.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,The other standout thing with this rubber is the ease at which I can loop/smash against chops.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I had a practice partner do chop/smash and chop/slowloop drills with me for maybe 3 hrs this week.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Totally natural to do.BW2 on the BH is still a mixed bag.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I certainly can get used to it, but I think thinner 2.0mm would have been better for OFF+ blade."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I like it for opening BH loops up close (low throw), blocking, and pushing."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,But it's clearly designed for all out attack which doesn't suit the BH so much.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Prolly works best for FHs on ALL to OFF blades.Very happy with CJ8000 (J).
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Thanks Nathanso for the tip!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I've found my T05 FH replacement.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,it is interesting when EJ guy wants always something a little different  I mentioned couple of times that I got interested in CJ8000 36-38 japanese because I previously played with CJ8000 39-41 chinese.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"this rubber is not that good for looping, but when you use more of a drive or loopdrive motion, you get the feeling that anything can get on the table regardless of incoming ball (although slower low balls need loop and that was the essential problem with cj8000 39-41 chinese)."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,with cj8000 36-38 I have not the same feeling of control when countering speedy balls (but give me couple of sessions more to evaluate this fully as I adjust to this rubber).
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"also the surface of cj8000 of 39-41 chinese was semitacky and little glossy, quite different to my cj8000 36-38 japanese."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"and it showed in serving, for serves like chinese a little more than japanese softer."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,also one more thing.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,with chinese 39-41 I got a feel of slight catapult when driving.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"this rubber was slower but not on huge shuts, the feel was a little faster."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"with softer 36-38 japanese I do not get this feelthe conclusion is clear: I don't know if it ever will, but if 39-41 japanese sponge shows, I would like very much to try this rubber on"
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Friendship, you are correct, with drive/loopdrive motion I do get the feeling of ""guaranteed in."""
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I'll have to pay more attention to control when countering speedy balls and slow-looping slow balls back.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Not sure it feels any better or worse than T05 at this point.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Thx for discussing the differences between (C) and (J).
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Sounds like even topsheet is different.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,This must be a plot by Palio to trick EJ's into buying 20 different variations in their rubbers.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Well, I hit against my robot and played a few matches with humans over last two days.If there's one shortcoming, CJ8000 is a bit too bouncy for short game."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Plus, center of rubber seems more bouncy than the edges."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I noticed that if I pushed using left/right side of blade for pushing, ball would push short, but anything center would push long."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I suspected my blade might be causing this, but no, BW2 pushes evenly on any part of the same blade."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I guess it could be my glue.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I usually use VOC-free water glue, but I ran out and had to use rubber cement instead."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Anyone else care to share their pushing experience with CJ8000?
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I'd like to hear from you.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Just wanna know if I'm nuts...I also tried chopping.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"CJ8000 is a bit too bouncy for chopping as well, but manageable."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,BW2 is better for chopping.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Even when sponge clicks, BW2 is very controllable."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Sorta defies logic.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,You'd think the crazy fast rubber would be insane to chop with.Smashlooping against high backspin -- CJ8000 hands down winner.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"So easy to do, I almost don't bother trying to slow loop anything back."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Just push against the low backspin.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Nothing like that happened on any of the 4-5 sheets we've opened thus far (all used glue sheets; some carrierless, one with carrier)."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Sounds like your VOC glue needs to offgas for a few more days.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I just received my two sheets of CJ8000 today and the red sheet looked a little splotchy on the surface.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"The black sheet looked ok, but the red had little marks all over it that could not be cleaned off."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,There was also a section at the top of the sheet that looked shiny while the rest of the sheet was matte finished.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I haven't hit with it yet so I don't know if it will affect the way it plays.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Any input?
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,My 2 sheets of CJ8000 were flawless.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,But I had splotchiness you described on my BW2 tuned sheets.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"There was some splotchiness on one of the black sheets I opened, though it didn't seem to affect play in any way."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,The red sheets I've seen looked perfect.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Today I reglued my CJ8000 (J) with Donic Vario Clean VOC-free glue.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Guess what?
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Short pushes are fine now!
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"Also to note, the sponge click is much louder now and the overall sponge feeling is harder."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Previously Elmer's rubber cement left an uneven and bouncy sponge feeling which made pushing inconsistent.So there you have it folks.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,CJ8000 (J) is great all around grippy rubber when using VOC-free water based glue.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I think some of the marks might be adhesive from the protective sheet and it wears off after a few cleans......
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I second this 100%.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Just played against a guy who had BWII (not sure if tuned) on his backhand and this comment rang true.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I'm not sure how they engineered this effect into their rubber or if it was intentional, but that ""low, last-minute drop"" is hard to play against and ridiculously consistent."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"The guy had BTY Catapult on his forehand and their wasn't that same effect.I don't know though, might have just been his backhand drive/loop technique, but when I played him I immediately remembered this review."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Rubbers that have neutral throw out of the sponge but have a high speed with high spin tend to get that last minute dive for the line once the ball speed slows because it seems the ball is still spinning very hard at that time so it just drops all the sudden.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,Pailo Thors being just about as fast as BW2 but much much more spiny does this in spades.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,I'm pretty sure you could pick the rubber from a video because it's very distinctive.
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"I can't say I'm often surprised that a ball landed, normally I know as soon as it's hit if it's good or not, but I've been surprised quite a lot lately."
132,5f6c31f9220a4650ffffda46,DOUBLE REVIEW: Palio CJ8000 Japanese vs. Blue Whale II tuned,"It seems to surprise opponents quite often too, but like anything you get used to it"
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,No reactions yet.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,so perhaps I just rephrase.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Can someone compare boost tc with hexer/baracuda?
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"TC is softer, better glue feel, less grip, less spin on slow strokes (serve/push/brush loop)."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Maybe similiar or a bit slower speedwise.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Hexer and Baracuda are Tenergy wannabes.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,So the Boost rubbers are easier to play with than Hexer?
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Perhaps I should go indeed with TC on FH and TP on BH, although I understand that TP has a very low throw, and I'm not sure if I would like that."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,I use a Stiga Boost TX on my backhand and Tenergy 64 on my forehand.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,I am VERY happy with the boost TX.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It feels firmer than the Tenergy 64.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It is almost as fast and as spinny as the 64.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It definitely has more control and more gears.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Plays very well with short pushes over the table and flat drives.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It has a softer sponge which allows u to loop well with excellent spin.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,The throw angle is a high medium.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"For me it is the perfect backhand rubber, no problems with it whatsoever."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"To be honest with you, on a scale of 1 to 10, Tenergy 64 is 9, the Boost is 8.5."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I would definitely recomment this rubber but overall tenergy seems better, but not by much."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Thanks, that's useful to know."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I don't have the time (or opportunity) to play more than twice per week, so I think I'll order some sheets of Boost once the current season is finished (only another 4 matches or so)."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Humza, your description of TX sounds interesting, I am tempted now to use this one."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Decisions, decisions...."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Bear in mind that Hexer and Baracuda are not identical.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Hexer is harder and faster and pretty much better in every way.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Not a whole lot better, but noticeably."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,(Obviously this means that some other players might prefer Baracuda.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,What this mainly means is they should not be considered exactly the samething).
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"From what I read I thought that they are virtually identical, with Baracuda only a little bit slower."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Perhaps that would make baracuda also a bit easier to play with?
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,And how does Tibhar Genius fit in this?
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,So Hexer is not very forgiving with poorly executed shots.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,How is Roxon 450 in that respect?
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I'm playing local league level, and very few people are indeed really good at the short game."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Leaning towards Roxon 450 now (but I might change my mind again....).
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Very useful advise - many thanks.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,In the end I went with baracuda.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Nice rubber, very spinny, durability could be better."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,I decided against the boost after reading elsewhere that it is very sensitive to humidity.
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I had a hit with Baracuda today, and I really liked it."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I think many people dismissed this rubber as some players reviewed it as being too slow, but I found it plenty fast enough, and it was very spinny."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"The sheet I tried certainly wasn't new, but I still got huge kick on my loops, so I suspect durability is not too bad either."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Coming from mainly Chinese rubbers, I've used to having to generate my own pace instead of getting a lot from the rubber, and the speed was quite good, easily faster than many Chinese rubbers, and probably only a little slower than t05."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"It's actually quite a bit slower than T05, but one could probably get used to it."
133,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It is quite spinny.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Those are really well done.The testing group was the most interesting of the lot.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Interesting conclusions they draw.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,It really does depend on technique...

134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"yep, good videos."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,thanks for posting!
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"nice video, good comparison."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,my teammate is using h3 commercial black on his backhand and h3 neo commercial red on his forehand.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"he likes both rubbers, he thinks they play pretty much the same with some minor differences."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"I thought the video was excellent, and it does confirm some of my own perceptions about the difference between the rubbers."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"I'd love to see more videos like that, but I'm sure it's a huge job to put something together like that."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"I dread to think how long it would take me to do something like that  I think to produce something like that one would have to be commited (or is that should be committed ) I've only had chance to see the first video, look forward to waching the others."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Whaooo.....
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Huge work !
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Many thanks for this very pro and technic approach for these DHS best sellers.Thanks again.Brahms
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Great technical videos.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"Earlier on, I had an opportunity to watch video of this sort in."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,The video initial scene showed the ball was played( loop/serve/push/hit/spin) from the table side.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"Then, in slow motion, the camera turned slowly to the receiver side where you may watch the effect of impact of rubber i.e the lateral curving motion of the ball in the air, the height above the table, the swinging intensity of the ball to the side etc."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Marvelous to watch.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"This should be done with every rubber in the world, compared to a ""standard"" rubber in a ""standard"" blade.Then we could stop with the companies lies about their products!"
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,I agree and I'd love to do that or see it done by someone else.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"Cars judge speed in either mph or kmh and there are standard economy measures but with there being so many different types of rubber - inverted tacky, inverted mechanical grip, short pips, medium pips, LP's, anti, different sponges and sponge thickness, so many different types of blades and different types of styles of play, which would you chose as the ""standard blade"" and ""standard rubber"" and how would you decide?"
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"I'm sure some of the manufacturers would volunteer for their equipment being the standard...  i agree though, whatever standard was used, it would provide an excellent reference..."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Very well done!
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,I wonder if these guys have any good ideas for testing spin reversal.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,"A project started months ago but way way off completion is comparing a sheet of butterfly super anti, 911, 563, 802-1 and maxspin (giant dragon) on a TSP Reflex all round blade and seeing how they react to different types of spin, taking in to account where the ball makes contact with the blade, how soon off the bounce, changes in bat angle, movement of the blade in different different directions at contact etc using high speed footage."
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,However this will take many months to do and there are problems with consistency of feeding the ball on to the bat to duplicate the amount of spin and speed and placement of the ball so only general conclusions and comparisons can be made not specific measures.
134,5f6c323b220a4650ffffda73,Video comparion of Hurricane 3 vs Hurricame 3 Neo,Add lighting problems with high speed footage and the whole spin thing is a problem to do.In the second video here there is an attempt to compare H3 and the H3 Neo's reaction to incoming spin - similar to measuring spin reversal - but it was difficult using side spin to get consistent feeds from the robot and too dark in the hall to use high speed filming effectively to film the results so at this time it wasn't pursued further.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"It's not very easy to use when far away from the table, I concur."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"I guess it never caught on with others because a more all-around rubber is easier to use for them, I suppose.Calibra throws similar to T64 or T25?"
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"I rather like T64 on the backhand...I guess I should try...edit: Ooh, the local distro has it -- it's about US$ 14 cheaper than Tenergy."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,Tempting!
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,Tempting?
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"You know you can't resist, just go and get a sheet and save yourself the trouble..."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,My older (and departing back to B1) teammate uses T05 and has T64 on his other blade.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"One is a sardius, but I can't recall which."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,He finds the T64 too fast for him and it throws too long (which may also be because its the one on the Sardius I think  ).
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,When Bty prices were about to rise I warned him and he dashed in and bought several sheets of T05 and T64 from Dandoy (which he had never heard of before this lol).
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,The other night he asked me what T25 was like and whether I thought it would be good for his game.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,I said I only knew of one user (read Yuzuki) of T25 and that it wasn't a rubber many had found to be as good as its tenergy brothers.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"Reading Baal's comments, maybe it would actually be good for this guy's game."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,Shame he didn't think of this before the price rise though  As a side-note I had a hit with his Sardius(?)
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,clad with T64.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,I quite liked it on the FH.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,But the BH felt like a cannon compared to my Ox LP
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"Actually, T25 might be a good match to a Sardius."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,It would feel pretty hard though.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"It would definitely be a possiblity if T64 is too bouncy.To clarify in case my writing is opaque, Calibra LT is more like T64 than the others."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,It is fast and throws long.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,But it is pretty good rubber.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"The LT SOund version is much softer, and oddly enough, I found it noticeably faster."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"T25 would probably be an interesting match to a Sardius, but would probably require good technique to keep the ball spinny, but blocks and smashes would be a hit."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"I'm interested in the Sound (softer) version, as I'm looking at Sriver FX -- too bad I just bought a sheet of Sriver FX just now."
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"Stiga rubbers come in 2.0mm and max, or do they go 2.1mm and max?---Shazz, going to have to buy Calibra Sound next time -- was too tempted to try out Boost TS (interesting rubber!)"
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,in 2.0mm variant.
135,5f6c3260220a4650ffffda8c,T 25 vs Calibra?,"Therefore, no more budget until the next rubber change..."
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,"Well, I had a chance to try both rubbers."
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,Roxon 330 has much better control and spin.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,The speed of both rubbers seem similar.I'll stick with Roxon 330.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,I use and love R450 and have a R330 max waiting to be tried when my R450 wears out.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,That could be about this time next year with the durability of Roxon.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,"I've never used a Donic rubber, but I can't say I've ever used a better rubber than Roxon either."
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,Nothing has come close for me!
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,"I find R450 2.0 brilliant and have no real control or power issues, but I figured R330 max might still up the control dial and keep the power up as well."
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,"When it first came out I thought it would be too mushy, but from what I have read from trusted sources this is not the case."
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,I haven't used R450.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,I have always used soft rubber for the control.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,"My guess is that you will lose a little speed if you switch to R330, but you will gain a lot of control and spin will probably be a little better.I agree with you about the durability."
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,Andro rubbers are very durable.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,"A little off topic, but has anyone else noticed the lack of R330?"
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,I've looked around a few websites and it seems most places either don't carry it in favor of 450/500 or it's $15 more expensive.
136,5f6c32a1220a4650ffffdab4,Andro Roxon 330 vs. Donic Coppa Jo Silver? Which is better?,I haven't noticed that.

137,5f6c32b5220a4650ffffdac0,rubber with Tenergy 05 sponge and yasaka Vstage top sheet??!,I've used T05 and would say Roxon would suit your gamestyle of looping and flat drive/smash.
137,5f6c32b5220a4650ffffdac0,rubber with Tenergy 05 sponge and yasaka Vstage top sheet??!,Its faster than T05 for this.
137,5f6c32b5220a4650ffffdac0,rubber with Tenergy 05 sponge and yasaka Vstage top sheet??!,If you were mainly a brush looper or purely topspin driver T05 would be better.
137,5f6c32b5220a4650ffffdac0,rubber with Tenergy 05 sponge and yasaka Vstage top sheet??!,Thats interesting to hear that Roxon has got good durability  May be i will get a sheet and give it a try.

138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"Hi Ilya, I don't know what you think about the 2 rubber sheets."
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,Do you like Roundell?
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,How soft is it?
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,Like a Sriver EL?
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,How does it compare to Catapult?
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"Roundell's sponge is similar to Sriver EL, but the topsheet is grippier and faster."
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,It is easily one of the better allround/offensive rubbers I have seen yet.
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"Nice thing about Roundell is that is is very elastic, but does not top out.Catapult is, IMO, unadulterated crap."
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"To be more exact, it is very bouncy at low speed, but tops out at anything beyond 50%."
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"It is not particularly sensitive to incoming spin, but it is similarly mediocre at creating its own spin."
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"It is a good rubber for people who primarily block and fish, but it is not particularly good at anything else.ILya"
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,Thanks Ilya.
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,Did you ever see Brian Pace's review of Catapult on the Butterfly website?
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,He makes Catapult sound like the best thing since sliced bread.It's nice to have an unbiased review.
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"No, I have not seen Brian's review."
138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,"I have long ago learned to ignore just about all information on the manufacturers' webpages aside from technical details: product name, sponge hardness, number of wood plies, etc."

138,5f6c32c6220a4650ffffdacc,Butterfly Roundell vs. Catapult?,Good advice!Thanks Ilya!
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"Mark V AD is a touch harder than Sriver FX, but isn't really that much faster."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,I doubt you'll find anywhere near as much speed diff between mark v ad max and sriver fx 2.1 as you are expecting.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,You might be better off just getting another sheet of 729 fx supersoft.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Or another alternative aeoliah is to get a sheet of Dawei Inspirit 35%.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Its quite slow and reasonably spinny and easy to control.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"I found it too slow for my liking, but it was very easy to control with."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Could be a good partner to the 729fx.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Try LKT Xt/Xp .
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Is light and very good
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,My coach made me compare Sriver EL & Mark V AD a couple of months back.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Both glued one layer.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"Previously I thought both are about the same but after comparing them head to head (one on each side of the blade - korbel at the time), Mark V ad is indeed faster."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Because Sriver EL is supposedly faster than the FX then the FX would be slower than Mark V ad too...
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"If you want to have one chinese & one japanese rubber on the blade, then perhaps you could try FX with 1.8 sponge too..."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,- I like the feel and control of EL more than Vad that's why I don't use Vad as much...
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"Thanks for your recommendations, I was thinking that also the maximum thickness is not suitable for beginner, but my retailer only sell maximum for Mark VAD."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"I think I will let my son try Sriver FX 1,8 or 2,1."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,That 007 rubber is another alternative.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Felt like jap rubber.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Not expensive.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Less than half of the price of Sriver FX.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"Not too fat, soft too.."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Mark V ad is mark V gps .
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Same rubber under 2 dif names.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Mark V GPS and sriver FX got same hardness and speed.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Sole touch slightly differs.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Now I managed to get myself confused
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,What I was thinking is to replace Mark V AD with something slower and not tacky rubber.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Sriver FX is not tacky.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,007 is not tacky.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"007 is available in both chinese, euro & jap sponges (same topsheet)."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,I think I will take Sriver FX.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Thanks for your advices.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Sriver FXBetter topsheet IMO.
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,"Was also in the same dilemma, thanks for the advices."
139,5f6c32cd220a4650ffffdad1,Mark V AD vs Sriver FX,Will be picking Sriver FX as well.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,yes
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"not understand what ""yes"""
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,ate a big difference in weight??
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,?
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,It is heavier but if you are just changing the forehand rubber the difference should not be more than 5 or 6 grams tops and I think you can get used to that.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"i play with bith, and can say that h3 neo is faster than tenergy!some people say that tenergy is faster but...NO first, h3 neo is a chinese rubber!"
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,tacky surface!
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"and maybe isn't the best option for hit, is for generate spin (specially topspin)....spin based game... is like compare sriver, bryce etc with hurricane series, no more about this theme please!"
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"very different rubbers, designed for different things!if you like the chinese rubbers and want more speed there are 2 options: 1. h2 neo: faster than h3 neo, similar tackiness, BUT IS LOW THROW2."
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"skyline 3 neo: faster than h3 neo and have the same throw, BUT LESS TAKCYin jap/euro rubbers... mmm..i can't advise you, i don't know the enough about it"
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"Hey I tried the whole hurricane neo 3 thing and was hopeless with it, does anyone think hurricane III no.19 sponge would be easier for to use?I am interested in: the weight reduction of it and the easier to catch the ball because it is softer."
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"The #19 was designed for use with glue... without it the rubber is slow as you don't get the speed of the firmer sponge.I quite liked the H3 Neo... it's topspeed is probably faster, but the Tenergy feels it has more energy at lower to medium speeds."
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,ie easier to generate the pace with the Tenergy...
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"Is the Tenergy 05 a good hitting rubber, I know about its spin, speed,weight etc but what about a flat hit at times?"
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,I don't think that's one of it's better qualities... it's a bit too sensitive to incoming spin IMO.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,throws a bit too high for flat hitting.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"I agree flat hitting you ought just get some short pips if that is all you want to do, or any old generation rubber will do just as fine.But as for the no.19, If I always stood at the table it might be ok?"
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,but you are probably right I won't be able to get a fast ball past people because I don't train enough.ahhhhhhhh
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"T05 is ok for hitting, but T25 is much better at this."
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"Thanks for the information, I don't out and out flat hit like I used to do , but I was thinking about Tenergy 05 for serving and if a pop up ball comes then i want to be able to put it away, I found very tacky rubbers hard to flat hit as well as they can grip the ball"
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,In that case it's not really the flat hitting I thought you were talking about.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,Yes you can smash pop ups.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,"Watch what Ma Long does for example, when people lob to him he twiddles his blade to his tenergy 64 side and smashes with that."
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,There was one point I remember at the wtttc 2010 against mizutani where he didn't and he smashed into the net and off the table.It is just the tenergy 05 excells at counter looping.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,Every rubber is has its strengths and weaknesses.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,I would still say that 05 because it is the most spin responsive will be the harder to smash with.
140,5f6c3302220a4650ffffdaee,H3 neo vs tenergy 05,64 felt the easiest to me since plays the softest and the blade comes into play more making a smash much easier.
142,5f6c3322220a4650ffffdb02,Yasaka Pryde 30/40 vs Yasaka Mark V,welcome to the forum!i cannot tel u about the yasaka rubbers but can say that most modern defeners like harder sponges as these give a bit more speed which is needed from far back from the table.
142,5f6c3322220a4650ffffdb02,Yasaka Pryde 30/40 vs Yasaka Mark V,also harder sponges generally have more gears.
142,5f6c3322220a4650ffffdb02,Yasaka Pryde 30/40 vs Yasaka Mark V,having said that i prefer soft sponges(30-35)
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,What is NT50?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"If by that you mean National Team 50 degrees, I think it's unusable."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,The highest I've personally seen of National Team rubber is 42degrees.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Anyways, the real stuff which I have serious doubts 99.9% of us are able to lay hands on feels a lot like Bryce."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"It's speed is amazing, and its topsheet is actually only mildly tacky, it bites the ball like crazy even on the thinnest contact.Tenergy 05 on the other hand is relatively slow, is heavier IIRC, and doens't bite the ball nearly as well."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"NT50 is a new japanese sponge of nittaku for the Hurricane series, its still very new, only japanese online stores have it."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"It is said to have some kind of built in speed glue effect, i guess, from the translation of japanese websites."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"There will be more spin and speed, for sure."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It's crazy expensive.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,5000JPY expensive.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"I was going to try it out..............but then decided to leave it for someone else as I don't have any fast blades in the OFF+ catergory.I might dare and get a Ishlion, it's so light!"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,And it's fast and is just about controlable.......
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Has anybody actually tried this rubber..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Ill have to agree the ishlion has a fantastic feel.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I like its stiffness and I dislike softer feeling blades as the arylate carbons and zylon carbons.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Yes its quite light!
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Why do you think it's crazy expensive..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It is in the same range of Tenergy.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It's Hurricane.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,5000JPY for a hurricane is crazy expensive.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Just checked the iruiru price.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,They are quoting it @ 3840 JPY.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Why so much reduction in the price..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,probably because of the amount of stock iruiru shifts.3840JPY is still pretty expensive for a hurricane
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Then what should be the reasonable price for a Hurricane..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"H3 should be about 2300JPY..I have got H3 on my Forhand now, since T05 far to expensive for my budget now and i find the sheets FARRR TOOO FRAGILE."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It only upsets me when i play with it because i have to be careful and im a very agressive player.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I have used the H3 for about 17 hours so far...
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"I dont really see a playing difference when comparing it to T05, i kind of actually prefer it over T05, it has enough spin on the ball plus i can get alot of speed on the loops."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Therefore a perfect combination of SPEED and SPIN.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"What more can i ask for?John Hilton and Alan Cooke told me that the H3 the asian market sells, is not the best quailty."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,They give the nationals the better sheets and sell on the other sheets to other people around the world.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Is this why there is H3 national team rubbers and normal H3?I'm no expect on the asian rubbers my self, but i do see my self sliding towards that market."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,The prices for the european rubbers are outrageous
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Ilovetabletennis, I didn't quite understand which H3 you speak about, is it the NT50?"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"I think i have the normal H3 i am not quite sure, like i said i am no expert with the chineese rubbers, this is my first time playing with them."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,If you could help me out by showing me what the differences are then il glading inspect my rubber and let you no.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05, Does Hurricane III NT50 has any built in speed glue effect..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Or is it just another variant of Hurricane series..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Does anybody know if it has got the same topsheet as H3 PRO from Nittaku..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Once I tried H3 on my FH and I found it dead, slow and not enough (top)spin when unglued."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I still hope to find a tacky Chinese rubber with type of sponge which will improve the general feel.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I have not experienced that.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"I find the topspins VERY spinny similar too T05, i have not speedglued the rubber as i do not use any tuners etc..."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"I find it very lively, the only issue i see with the rubber is that it is pretty heavy"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,How is the speed of your H3 compared to T05..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Most deffo Tenergy is faster.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Is Tenergy even that quick, or is it much more famed for it's spin?"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"it ought to be faster than h3, whatever the sponge it's on.mmm I should get myself a sheet of NT50..."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I believe the H3 i use is not the NT50 :S not quite sure i will take some pics and post it so you guys can see for yourselfs
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,You'd know if you bought the NT-50...It's marked as a Nittaku rubber on the packaging.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,You won't be able to tell by the topsheet.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I believe this is the normal H3?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Hi Silver, Have you bought the sheet of H3 NT50..?"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"nah not yet.Sort of lazy, plus, I'm not sure how well they'll go on hinoki blades.Soon...maybe."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"The problem I'm having right now is that after T05, anything else I try feels sort of... crap... meaning I'll give a biased do-not-like-as-much-as-tenergy review."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,So finally you are back to Septear..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"?If yes, then welcome back to 7 Ply Hinoki Club..!"

143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I played with Huricanne 2 NT50 for about 2 months now.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,And i must say its a better rubber for modern defender than any of tenergy series.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Very consistent for chopping and looping, and plus is much lighter than tenergy."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,How will Hurricane II NT50 play on composite blades like Maze or TBS..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"i dont have Maze or TBS, so i cannot compare it."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Sorry...With the firm sponge that NT50 has, i don't think blade will affect the performance of the rubber, IMO."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Since you are using this rubber for last two months, how is it playing after two months..??"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Has the spin or the speed gone down?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Are the edges cracking..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Just want to know how durable is this rubber..!!
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Thanks in advance..!
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,!Duke
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,After 2 months ( about 50 hours of play ) it still in great shape.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,No cracks like tensor rubber or tenergy.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Topsheet lost a little bit tackiness, so less spin and more speed."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I think i can use this rubber for another 30 hours before it wore out.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It is pretty durable for 40 dollar rubbers in my opinion.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Thanks Kent..!
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,!This rubber seems quite durable by today's standard.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Have you used Tenergy..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Because you mentioned the cracks in Tenergy.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Did these cracks occurred by themselves or were they because of the bat touching the table..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I want to try Tenergy and I have heard that it is also very durable.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,What do you say..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"?Regards, Duke"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Yeah i used tenergy 64 prior to this rubber.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Tenergy is also durable, it gave me about 70 hours of play per sheet before losing its grip."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"It just when people smash the ball so hard and it hits your edge of the blade, it will make small cracks."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"You still can play fine with it, not like tensor rubber that can have huge crack by themselves."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,you're very welcome.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"BTW Kent, Did you prime this H2 NT50 rubber with some normal VOC glue or some speed glue..??"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Or did you just used it as it was..??
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,My brother has got a sheet of H3 NT50 and he says that it feels ok but nothing compared to what he had been told about this rubber.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"It is getting better in speed but in spin department, there is not much improvement with continuous use."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Is this NT50 sponge a Tensor like sponge or just a hard Chinese sponge..?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,?Thanks in advance.Duke
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I only use the newest water based butterfly glue.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"If you compare to normal H2 rubber, it has same spin coz basically it is the same topsheet, it just have built in speed glue effect."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,NT50 is nowhere close to tensor rubber.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It has very firm sponge.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,i can say it plays like slightly glued old PF4-1.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"The only thing i like about this NT50 sponge is the speed glue effect only come to alive when i'm attacking and looping ( and i use medium hard blade, i don't know how it plays with soft blade ), so when i'm chopping or blocking the sponge is dead so i have much more control."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Yes, you can say it is a hard chinese sponge with glue effect."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,It is very effective rubber if you play chinese style..
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Silver I am totally in the same boat now.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"I know you are testing other rubbers again, just as I have been doing a lot of."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"But all my reviews and all my feeling tend to keep coming down to similar points, how much slower and how much less spin than tenergy 05."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Oh and how much cheaper.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"well that is the first thing to get out the way, and then say how much more short touch shots improve for any other rubber."
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I should just copy paste that part for every review I do.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Back to your comment - I think a some new forum voabulary is needed.
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,like post tenergy withdrawal
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,+1
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,May someone confirm the hardness of the H3 NT50 ?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,"Cause if the feeling is like a PF4-1 freshly speed glued, it's around 45° !"
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Is the NT50 softer compare with the H3 Neo ?Is the built-in effect similar with the H3 Neo ?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Thanks !Brahms
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,I'm also interested to know...How does the NT50 sponge compare to a NEO 39deg sponge?
143,5f6c3326220a4650ffffdb03,Hurricane III NT50 vs Tenergy 05,Softer?NEO 39deg is already quite soft to me.Well for tackiness I guess this NT50 cannot be compared to the original DHS topsheet...and especially the National ones... the National ones are very tacky and lasting with faster sponge.
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,I found the Bryce line of rubber to be excellent in this particular usage.
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"I haven't personally tried the Express 1 or 2, so I can't vouch for them."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"I used Joola Express 1 last season, and it was the fastest rubber around at the time."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Very flat throw, with a low spin level make it the opposite of Tenergy."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Great for hitting at the table, excellent for pushing (seems to grip well on slow shots), consistent smashes."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"The downside is the low spin, which makes it hard work for loopers, but for blockers (you have to be good to control it though) and hitters it's excellent."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,Pretty hard sponge lacks feel (on an Andro Super Core Off+) but gives a positive air to the rubber - it's getting the ball back rather than sinking in.
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"If you're comparing it to Bryce Speed FX then Express 2 is the similar rubber (softer sponge), which will add some spin and feel at the expense of pace."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"I'm probably changing to Bryce Speed in the close season (May) unless the new toys they bring out look more fun.Also worth considering Andro Hexer - a loss of speed to the 2 above, but very accurate and quite spinny (can lift pushes easily) and plentry of gears."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Plays well attacing over the table with all-out top-spin hits, but durability can be an issue if you play more than 10 hours a week."
144,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Great post, welcome to the forum ScousePaul!"
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,t64 isspringiergrabs the ball moreslightly less reactive to spinslightly fastersofter topsheetmuch more durablespinwise YMMV.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I get more spin out of t64 than outlaw.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I will give it a go as it sounds more like the types of rubbers i have been using.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Im used to glued Sriver EL's but want to make the switch to a non glued rubber
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,adding to what silver said:t-64 more linear than outlaw.t-64 more spin on serves.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Really?
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"Not my experience, Outlaw is incredibly linear for such a quick rubber.Also add....Outlaw > more money left for beer"
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,only for the first week.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Then you realise you have to replace it every few weeks because it keeps tearing
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"ha ha!Actually, the new outlaw is vastly improved - not as durable as tenergy I agree, but not bad at all."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I agree on most things but Outlaw is definitely less reactive to spin than Tenergy.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Infact I find Gambler Outlaw to be one of those rubber that's very little affected by the incoming spin.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I have used Outlaw as my main FH weapon of choice the last year on the TBS.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I have now had a week playing T05.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I agree with Sunflex in that Outlaw is WAY faster and also less reactive to spin.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I generate PLENTY of overwhelming power and spin on power loops and medium loops with Outlaw.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Outlaw does not let me down with flat hits either.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Simply a bullet.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"Like Silver said, serving with Tenergy is great, but I could get pretty good spin on serves from Outlaw."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"T05 sacrifices a ton of speed, but the slow to medium shots simply go in more often and with more spin than it appears."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"I did not have this ""middle"" game very much playing with Outlaw, T05 opens a new world to my game."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,T05 isn't T64 of course.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I play against 3 J-Penners who use T64.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"T64 to them seems to play like a springier, faster, somewhat (but not much) less spinny version of T05."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"Their middle game is awesome, as well as finishing shots."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"If I use edge tape to slow down the edge crumbling, and don't tear the sheet on corners or whatnot, I get 6 weeks of daily play 3-4 hours out of Outlaw."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"If I am unfortunate and pop a few pips under the topsheet on my power shots, or hit an edge, then into the trash can goes that sheet of Outlaw."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"If my sheet of T05 can get 4-5 months out of T05 playing every day a few hours, then it is break even."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"As a plus, Tenergy is not nearly affected by humidity like Outlaw is affected."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"Good grief, power looping and counter looping with Outlaw in high humidity is a formula to get you highly pissed off."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"In light of that, if you can get more than a few months from Tenergy, it is worth it."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,The humidity is why I got a sheet of T05.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Late spring and summers here are murder with humidity.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,And based on what i have been used to I think T64 will be a closer match for me.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"oh ok, haven't tried the new one.i'd say that outlaw is more linear than t64."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Need to put more effort in than t64 for the same speed.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"Where could I get this ""more durable new line"" of gambler ?"
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,How to recognize it ?
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Is there a new package ?
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"Haggisv, do you carry it ?"
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,Unfortunately there wasn't any change to the packaging or external markings.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"However, it was a little while ago now and outlaw seems to have been pretty popular so I expect any sheet you bought now would be the new formulation.Don't be under any illusions; it is not a long lasting rubber even now; but it is far better than it was and I no longer break pips despite hitting very hard."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,"It is the edges that still suffer, but not as much and edge tape seems to help.Unfortunately for Gambler many customers will have given up on the rubber before the improved version was introduced.For humidity issues, I find an occasional 'clean' with spinmax helps tremendously."
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I will swap 4 sheets of outlaw for 1 sheet of any tenergy.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,(NEW)I know that is a loaded statement and this isnt the equipment buy and sell section - sorry but I think it carries the IMO clause and is a true offer if anyone is interested.
145,5f6c333d220a4650ffffdb10,Tenergy 64 vs Outlaw,I think for the price i will stick with Outlaw
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,jo silver is a tensor.
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,soft.
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,wears out rapidly (actually all Donics do for some reason).
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,40 degrees stated.
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,Fairly fast for how soft it is.Mark V is well... Mark V.Mark V AD is a slightly softer version of Mark V. I guess it's supposed to be between Mark V 30 and Mark V.Both are harder than CJS
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,What about speed ?
146,5f6c3342220a4650ffffdb14,Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V and MarkVAD,I suppose JO Silver is faster compared to both Mark V and Mark VAD ?
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,That's a lot!
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,"Perhaps you should measure it, or the 1.9mm is actually different... perhaps harder?"
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,I am not that suprised.
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,I have found the 2.2 vs 2.0 to also be a major difference in chinese rubbers.
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,I think there is as much or more difference between 2.2 and 2.0 as between 2.0 and 1.5.
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,"Please explain this, do you mean that it is bad in 1,9 or just different ?How is the 1,9 working on the bh side ?is it too slow away from the table ?"
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,I don't use tenergy on the bh.
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,"Silver, I am curious to know why you converted to 1.9mm sponge."
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,"What are (were) the major factors contributing to your decision?I have found that in 2.1, with any kind of positive forward stroke, that many more shots against a slow to medium ball simply go in with control that was never there with other rubbers I tried."
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,"The resulting gain in points, or at least being able to stay in them longer, is a compelling argument to stay with T05 in 2,1 sponge."
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,I give up the 10X turbo boost finishing power of Outlaw for the ability to hit shots I missed before and trouble the opponent more often.
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,"Trying to control the opening loop.If there's one thing I've noticed with T05 2.1mm is that if you're not constantly practicing or even constantly playing a couple of times a week, it's not a forgiving rubber."
147,5f6c3344220a4650ffffdb15,T05 2.1mm vs 1.9mm,It's difficult to 'back off' successfully and play a safe half-hearted shot.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,I will also like to know what is so special about Nittaku Hurricane NT50..??
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,Never heard anything about it except it is pretty expensive.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,"Nittaku H3 Pro - no glue its crap, with glue probably one of the best H3 Provincial rubbers you can get.H3/2 NT50 - simply put its crap."
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,Even with glue.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,"@Wiz, Have you really used this H3 NT50..??"
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,I wonder why you call it a crap..?
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,?
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,I would enjoy if someone (rich or Nittaku addict) could make a light review of the Nittaku Hurricane NT50.I bought few weeks ago a neo version.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,"Thanks all ,Brahms"
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,"Nittaku Huriccane NT50 is the closest rubber you can get that have the same feel, characteristic and quality to the national version (2009 ones with orange sponge)."
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,I use NT50 rubber occasionally for training when i burn the national version too fast.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,what about the hardness of the sponge of the Nittaku Hurricane 3 NT50 ?
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,Are you using speed glue?
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,Nope.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,All of this rubber already have glue effect built in.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,I think around 41 degree.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,They dont say it in the packing and i dont have the tools to check it.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,Thanks for the info.I know what the second gift for Christmas will be.
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,"If the hardness of the sponge is 41°, the NT50 is a little bit harder than H3 NEO (around 39°).Merry Christmas !"
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,!
148,5f6c3352220a4650ffffdb20,Nittaku Hurricane Pro 3 vs Nittaku Hurricane NT50,"""If the hardness of the sponge is 41°, the NT50 is a little bit harder than H3 NEO (around 39°)""true?"
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,IQUL 40 deg.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,"Will be firmer and faster.You don't give us much information, so we can't help you much."
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,Do you need more speed or control?
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,What are you looking for in an upgrade?
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,The rubber that you are using is not a bad rubber if a little on the heavy side.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,IQUL is lighter and faster and also has good spin.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,IQUL max in 42 degree sponge is the fastest.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,There are better looping rubbers out ther if that is what you are looking for.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,sorry.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,I am looking for more speed with the same control i get from a softer sponge.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,I like the non-tacky topsheet since i flip alot on my Bh.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,do you guys think the IQUL SV 35 degrees would be much faster while maintaining the same control?I kinda was thinking if the sriver el or the mark v is better than the IQUL then the extra $$ is worth it.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,IQUL 42 degree is the fastest of the lot and in my opinion is faster than Sriver and Mark V.
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,What is IQUL ???
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,sorry for a noob question
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,"It is not a noob question at all, there is still tons that I don't understand about the game, and unless you ask, you will never know."
149,5f6c3370220a4650ffffdb35,Sriver El VS Mark V for BH,IQUL is short for Inspirit Quattro Ultralight.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,I am imaging that 729 Super was not a good match for your blade and game.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"It would go better on a soft feel OFF blade, probably a hinoki, to produce lots of spin during counterhits."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,I had a similar combo and would benefit from that rubber.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,Now I don't know anything about 729-2 but I have a BTY PowerDrive classic and it plays like a Nebula on steroid.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"For hitting I would use Butterfly rubbers with a thin sponge, or something like Inspirit from the Chinese."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,producing lots of spin during counterhits?
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"The 729-2 topsheet seems harder and more rigid, which gives it more speed."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,The sheets I've seen still seem quite tacky.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,Yes spin.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,We have hitters in our club that use stiff blades and soft slow one.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"The stiff blade one produced a ball that's very direct when he hits it, probably like what you do."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"The one who use a soft wood tends to be able play like a looper (from a distance) but he does make direct, solid contact with the ball!"
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,When he counterhits hard from long distance the ball has an arc and it dips to his opponent's surprise.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,WTF!
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,yes you're right I hit very hard flat and direct especially with my forehand.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,The other player you're talking about I have never played such a player  .
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,Today I had another go with my test bat BBC Anvil( Off+ carbon ) with Gambler Wraith 2.2 and Super FX 1.5 on my backhand.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"I could flick very good with the 729 rubber, it seemed liked it wasn't sensitive to spin as much as before."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"Blocks and hits were very flat, but still to inconsistent especially against very fast balls."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,Serving and pushing was perfect.
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,"With Gambler Wraith I could block and hit very consistently and fast too, Wraith on Nebula didn't work out for me simply too slow."
150,5f6c337a220a4650ffffdb3a,729 Super FX Blue sponge vs 729-2 HRS.,I'm now curious about the 729-2 HRS sponge in 2.2 I think that work even better on the bbc anvil.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"""On the other hand, it is also easier to create spin with tacky rubbers which might make some people lazy, as it is so easy to create spin with them."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"""So would you say you would become a better player with Euro/Jap rubbers because it makes you work harder?"
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"You could use the same argument by saying 'tacky rubbers are more sensitive to spin, so it makes you watch the spin more carefully."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Non-tacky rubbers make you lazy as they are less sensitive to spin'Both styles of rubbers have advantages and disadvantages, so neither is better than the other, they are just different and suit different styles."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,This is why you still find both types of rubbers even at the Elite levels.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,I think this isn't an issue to argue about.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Some people like a bouncy rubber, others like a linear rubber."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I think people buy the stuff they like, whether Japanese/European or Chinese rubber, because it conforms to what they expect the ball to do when they hit it."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Mostly a matter of ball feeling.I would say that you became a better player as a result of forgetting about the equipment and focusing on the other game elements.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"If Euro/Jap makes you play like this, then so be it."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Both have their strengths.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Tacky rubbers are great offensive weapons for the short game, serves and massively spinny loops.... however they are not as dynamic as euro type rubbers in that euro rubbers can have a lot of control, I find them easier to loop underspin with, and then with the right blade and sponge hardness they can still produce good mid distance loops."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,It depends on where the gears that you need most are at that makes for a good decision to go with one or the other.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"True about the top players in the world being chinese, but those players are lucky being able to just play TT in their lives."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,I do agree that the subject wasnt something to argue about.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,My friend just kept insisting that his chinese equipment was better than my Euro/Jap set up and kept insulting it.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,i told him i preferred it but being a good stubborn friend ignored what ive said.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Even though ive finally beaten him w/ my new set up, he still insists the chinese stuff was better.Thanks guys"
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Fantastic!
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Beat him up some more.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,But fortunate for me not to have such a friend who seems to be as stubborn as a mule.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Good fortune for you.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,i agree speedplay.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,My placement has improved greatly after i upgraded FROM chinese rubbers.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Playing w/ euro/jap made me understand what people talked about the ""GEARS"" of a rubber."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"i improved so much, i think i am ready for my first tournament which is going to be in Lakeland,Fl."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,A funny thing is that a lot of really good Chinese players use a tacky chinese rubber on their forehand and a Euro/Jap rubber on their backhand.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,And many of the professional chinese players who have come to Houston to coach use Butterfly rubbers.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"As everyone say, it really depends on your preference."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I have used both Jap rubbers (Sriver, Sriver EL, Tackifire), Euro (Tibhar Intra) and Chinese (729 Fx, 2000-Tack speeds), chinese rubbers are still the ones for me.In terms of quality."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I think Japanese & Euro rubbers are way ahead of chinese rubbers (in terms of rubber life, durability etc."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,").However, for a person who's just picking up the sport, I recommend the person to use chinese rubbers because its cheap."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"After the person have discovered his playing style, he can then decide to move on to better and more expensive rubbers."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,I am totally sold out on the IQUL 2.2 rubbers in 42 degree sponge.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,They cost just 16 dollars and at least for me are much better than the more expensive Srivers and Mark Vs.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I also find them to be fast, spinny and great for the short game."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"On the other hand this does not mean that Chinese is better than Euro/Jap, just that this particular product is a very good one, as are many other Chinese products."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"They are all good, or bad, players have their preferences and for a player who loves Euro equipment, that is the best, etc.I have just tried two Chinese products for the first time, a 5 dollar 729 FX rubber, and from the way it played, I think its an incredible steal at this price."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,The other rubber I tried out on a very hard Chinese Real blade is the Blutenkirsche Tokyo rubber.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"It seemed very tacky out of the box, but that wore off fast, and now it plays pretty much like a grippy rubber."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Again a decent Chinese product.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"The Euro/Jap rubbers usually last longer, usually are uniform with few if any quality control issues."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"But if the only factor was playablity, I am sure many Chinese rubbers are as good or better than Euro/Jap rubbers."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Better in fact if the factor was playablity to cost ratio.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I have a new club mate, in St. Joseph's Winter Haven Table Tennis Club, telling me that chinese rubbers are ideal for the younger players because it makes them work more."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I do agree with him, may it be looping underspin, emphasis on spin, or having to rely more on your technique to create speed."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,He mentioned that he prefers european rubbers because he is an older gentleman and doesnt have the bone and joints for the dynamics of creating his own speed.
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Although chinese equipment do have quality issues, it comes with it with the cheap price tag."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I came up with the conclusion that chinese rubbers tend to make you focus on technique more than euro/jap style rubbers, although we all SHOULD focus on our techniques rather than equipment."
151,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Would you agree w/ my conclusion?Of course a player's preference is a major factor too since it is only my opinion
153,5f6c33c5220a4650ffffdb64,Bryce VS Sriver EL,"Well, I used both, I would say Bryce feels harder, lower throw, works particularly well in power looping and punch-blocking."
153,5f6c33c5220a4650ffffdb64,Bryce VS Sriver EL,"Not so well in loading lots of spin unless you have a strong wrist action.Sriver EL is a bit more all-around in usage, probably a bit slower."
153,5f6c33c5220a4650ffffdb64,Bryce VS Sriver EL,"It have a better ball bite, so it's a bit easier to feel the ball when making it spin."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Wow great review speedplay, and very useful comparison as well!Sounds like we have another Hexer fan!"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Great review Speedplay  .
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"My opinion coincide with yours, though I didn't have the chance to compare it with any Roxon."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"I did compare mine with T05/64 and I found it rather close to the T05, but I have Hexer since almost two months and must mention some durability problems like the ""first-week-spot-in-the middle..."" and humidity vulnerability."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Now, when we have a really exceptional cold and dry winter it still plays OK, but I've already prepared a T64 (and a 05) to replace it in a week or so, when we get the usual humid consistency here, in Brussels."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Fortunately enough , the Swedish air is dryer-as I remember correctly and I am a bit jealous for it...."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Very good review indeed.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I'm a fan of your reviews speedplay.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I have adviced this rubber for a friend who is now very happy with it.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),He is mainly a blocker but his active play improved very rapidly already.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),He is attacking in positions where he used to block passively and that suprises cost me a few more points!
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Most excellent review, speedplay!"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),u've covered a lot of finer technical aspect of the rubber which most reviewers are not even aware of.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"most just use flashy words that does not indicate in-depth knowledge.using R500 & R450 as references & comparable brings out the strengths & weaknesses clearly & gives a good guage of the rubber's ability.IMO, u're one of the best reviewer that i have read so far wz a high level of self-awareness."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Thanks again !
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"hmmm SP I know you did a geat job here accumalating the facts and comparing the rubbers much better than I could have done, but for me i found your post hard to read and too long and my little brain couldn't handle it lol, my brain was going back aforward and so ended up not even getting past the first page."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I like facts and stats in a graph type form speed 1st Hextor 2nd Roxon500 etcloop .....spin ....control...smashing...short game...Like a quick reference list please
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Excellent comparative study of rubbers, Speedplay!"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Quite a lot of work behind!
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Really like the review.By the way, I have been trying to get Roxon 450, but local vendor runs out of stock and it will take him another 3 months minimum to get new stock."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Would you guys suggest a prompt supplier?
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Megaspin?
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Interesting...I actually found T05 easier to control than Hexer...
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),nice review speedplay.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Im looking for a new fresh R450, but I might try the hexer, I play ALL+ like style, would you sugest it?"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I am having that same feeling with a sheet of Tenergy 05 I out on just before Christmas.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),well I got my sheet of hexer in the post yesterday.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),As always the packaging the rubber is in was basic yet amazing just like notmal Andro packaging.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),my one problem is how cluttered the rubber stamp is.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"I understand these new rubbers have to have their code on to prove they're legal, but because of that all the tensor bios logos were forced onto one side and the stamp just looks cluttered."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I took a photo on my iPhone and when I get a chance to upload I will show you what I mean.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"gona try and have a knock tonight before I play my match tomorrow night as I want to get a feel of the rubberone thing I will say, it feels a little bit heavier then R450, and the sponge is a very odd looking sponge, I dont mean the fact its red, I mean the look of it, it almost has that washing sponge look to it if you know what i mean lol"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"yeah I got a black sheet, always dealt with black because I believe it lasts longer and provides more grip."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"But as for the sponge, red, orange, its the same thing, I just called it red lol."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Like I said earlier when i can find out how to upload photos from the iPhone to the net (I might just ahve to plug it into the PC....) I'll show.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I would use my normal camera but its not good for closeups lolI expect I might get the same duribility problems but being i have a black sheet it might be diferent
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Maybe a bit of Olive oil would ""moisturise"" the Hexer's grip?"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"well if thats the case, I hope Spinmax will see me through the end of the season"
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),happens!
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),spinmax aqua cures it ... better than original.
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"looks like I need to get that edging tape on mine and do that tonightwell I had a hit with it, just a hit, knocking up against guys who dont want you to work on your new rubber is hard to play."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"But I did notice the spring diference, took no time to adjust to but was funny at first, the rubber felt slower, but then again it is slower then 450."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"But spin (when I had a chance to use it) was very nice, hard to compare with R450 but the counter topspins felt effortless, I think that lack of spring helps get a nice smooth counter topspin."
154,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"A small note, when I connected perfectly when going for the loop fir time I thought the ball was cracked, it made that much of a nice noise lol"
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,I'm just now putting a sheet of Hexer on my blade with Genius on the other side.I'll post some comparison details late this week.
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,Thanks jevansau.
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,Please don´t leave me waiting too long
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,The rubbers are very similar.
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"I found the Hexer a touch harder, but this could be just because the Genius is a few months old."
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"In general though, I could just play the same shots for the same results with either rubber."
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"The Genius was also slightly lighter, but only a couple of grams."
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,Thx.
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"In terms of spin, which could produce more, especially when serving?"
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,I'm not sure but hexer felt a bit harder and a bit spinnier to me...
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,But genius is still very spinny rubber for a tensor...
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"I tried both rubbers briefly, not a long time ago and I like Genius better than Hexer."
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,Genius did felt lighter but i think it was just a bit harder though.
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"Hexer was better on serves and loops, but i didn't feel comfortable hitting with it nor blocking, it seemed like it was really springy and some of my shots were not consistent enough."
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,"Genius i had more control and better hitting, but just a little less spiny."
155,5f6c3409220a4650ffffdb8d,Genius vs Hexer,I would get Genius because it had more control and similar spin and speed to Hexer.
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"Barracuda (Red Max on a Viscaria blade) felt a lot softer than Tenergy 64 or 05 and was markedly slower, I thought it was too slow."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"It felt mushy/soft compared to T64 (but I prefer somewhat harder feel, these days I use T05)."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"It was very spinny, pretty high throw, but it was difficult to use off the table, as if the thing couldn't stand up to the pressure of hard looping even from second position."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"Decent feel on blocks, excellent touch for serving, but it has a kind of weird non-linearity to it that made it feel quite erratic; it is as if it is missing the middle gears."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"In short, it has some of the qualities of Tenergy but falls short in almost every respect."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"Petermoo has a review on this forum, he basically found it to be too slow."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"I assumed Barracuda would be the same as Hexer, but it is not, Hexer is better on my blade and in my hands, harder, a bit faster, a bit more like Tenergy, still not as good (and almost as expensive).Xiom Vega pro may be another story."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"Comments on the other thread make it sound really promising, especially given price."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,My experience with Boost rubbers is too short to be of much use.
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"I bought a sheet once, put it on my blade, played with it for five minutes, hated it, took it off, gave it to somebody."
156,5f6c3420220a4650ffffdb9c,Boost TS vs Donic Baracuda,"I can barely remember why, can't remember which of the two versions it was."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"Welcome to the forum crashdtm!I have not compared them side by side, but I'd think SP certainly has similarites!"
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"I find the Hurricane 2 quite durable though, as long as you keep it clean and keep the plastic on."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,What do you think is worn out?
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"Tackwise same, may be SP has more."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,But for some reason it's less spinny than H2.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"Comparing Transcend SP (red) and H2 blue sponge (black):- SP is heavier - H2 BS is lighter than commercial H2- SP is much more durable- SP is faster, at least this is what I remember- H2 BS has a more suple topsheet = easier to loop(?"
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,)If I'll remember more info I'll post it.I wonder why RITC hasn't come up with a better version of the Transcend sponge.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,They didn't released anything impressive for the post glue era.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,Both rubbers are slow.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,SP is spinnier than H2 com by quite a bit.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,I have SP on my HK (only ever practiced with it once and put it down).
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,It looped nicely and if I had tried it a couple of years ago may have loved it.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,I was already into my Gergely and Andro by the time I got to it and well...there is simply no comparison!
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"H2 com I used for a while a couple of years ago and it was ok, loops were not as spinny as SP and I think it might have been a little slower even (from memory)."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,Thanks for the input.
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"I used to use andro Roxon 450 in 2.0 mm, but I found them to be too difficult for me to play consistently with, but that was about a year ago."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"Since then I've also used gambler outlaw in 2.2 mm and found that to be comfortable to control with good speed, but I feel like my game has improved the most from using H2."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,"I wouldn't mind using a faster rubber, in fact I have given a lot of thought into using outlaw again."
157,5f6c3446220a4650ffffdbae,SP Transcend vs. Hurricane 2,Its just that I've started to really like high spin rubbers and wanted to see if SP transcend was worth trying out  .
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,Me and a friend were comparing Platin and Boost TS on a Sardius and there wasn't much similarity .TS feels softer and slower.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,Sinus Alfa felt closer to the TS(on the same wood) but we still liked the Sinus Alfa better.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,"Platin is faster and harder and better on the short came, lower throw."
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,"Question of taste as to which you will prefer, both are good rubbers."
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,"Platin is way faster than Boost.Both spin the ball but in different ways, TS has considerably more dwell time and sponge is softer.I like Boost TP which is a bit more forgiving and have just ordered TX to try.Petermoo"
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,TX is even better.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,Didn't try it on a hard carbon blade though.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,Well I've played with Boost TS max for three days now and I can say that this isn't the rubber for me.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,It's a really great rubber but it doesn't suit my style of play and stroke.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,"I used it in my FH and I often go for a killer with my first FH-attack, but I didn't get the same response with TS as I did from Platin since I have a pretty ""thick"" contact with the ball which needs a bit harder rubber."
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,Baracuda is pretty different from lets say platin and lack that catapulteffect that platin has.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,"However, it's REALLY spinny, spinnier than tenergy and with a rather high throw."
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,It is slow compared to platin but still it's not a slow rubber.
158,5f6c347e220a4650ffffdbcd,Boost TS vs Platin?,I would probably put the speed just below tenergy which I personally feel is quite a slow rubber because the lack of catapult.
159,5f6c3497220a4650ffffdbdd,dawei quattro vs lkt pro xp,"Have you got an attacking, defensive, or all-round BH.Dawei would probably be a bit faster, so it just depends what style you play with your BH.DON'T FORGET TO VOTE (CLOSES at 7:20 20th OCT)OOAK Comp No 1: Funniest OOAK forum poem VOTES OPEN NOW!viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8777"
159,5f6c3497220a4650ffffdbdd,dawei quattro vs lkt pro xp,i'm an attacker and mainly use my backhand to block drive and loop (push if i don't feel safe to open up).
159,5f6c3497220a4650ffffdbdd,dawei quattro vs lkt pro xp,already decided to go for dawei as i heard the lkt was slightly tacky.
159,5f6c3497220a4650ffffdbdd,dawei quattro vs lkt pro xp,"i used various euro rubbers mainly in 2.0 thickness until now, wanted to put some more control on the backhand and save some buck."
159,5f6c3497220a4650ffffdbdd,dawei quattro vs lkt pro xp,i'm thinking dawei quattro shouldn't be too fast since i'll be using it in 1.8.
159,5f6c3497220a4650ffffdbdd,dawei quattro vs lkt pro xp,I think the tackiness is pretty much the same on those 2... certainly after a single sessions of play...
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I doubt they are comparable as someone liked roxons just think tenergies are too different... but others might have different opinions.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Hi 5minIs there any chance you are referring to me or Kouros because if you are you are absolutely right we both liked the Roxon series but can not understand all the fuss regarding the the tenergy rubbers they are just totally different animals in both feel & spin.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Sorry Vincent I can not compare them for you because I just never persist with tenergy on my FH for more than a couple of minutes before moving on, this is mainly because I do not need a looping machine as I am more of a hitter so much of its appeal is lost on me."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Don't get me wrong I can control it and hit with it (its nowhere as fast as I am am used to) but it just does not feel right for my short game.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Its obviously a great rubber otherwise why would it be so popular.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"I've not used the various Roxons, but have used many other Tensors in the Donic product line, which are probably similar, and also Joola Express One and Express two and Xiom Omega III."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"The Donics I've used include Platin, Platin soft, Gold, and F1."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I have used Tenergy 05 and 64 on my forehand.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Right now I am playing with Tenergy 64.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"I use all of them on a Butterfly Viscaria (a soft carbon-arylate), I play close and middle distance and use short pips on my backhand, and try to attack as much as possible with my forehand.As has been said, they are very different classes of rubber."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"(Of course, there is a lot of variation within the class of Tensors, but some generalizations can be made)."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Both Tenergy's are much spinnier than any Tensor I have used and have a much higher throw.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"The hard sponged Tenrors are vastly superior for short game, especially returning serve, they will feel crisper when hitting."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,The Tenergy series are spin monsters when looping.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,You just need to make a little effort to try to get top spin on the ball and the thing will be loaded.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,And that is what they are for.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"That is why very strong players tend to like them, because they are looking to hit heavy topspin whenever it is an option, and they want to be ab le to do it with different paces."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,They are not great for everything.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"They are not ideal for everybody, and i have had to take some time to get it into my head what they allow me to do."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"This is not to say that Tenergy series are quite good for blocking, they feel about the same as Tensors."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"They hit ok, not as well as crisply or as explosively as Tensors."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,They are definitely a liability for return of serve and push.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,But they can pack topspin like I have never seen before and they have a lot of gears when you are spinning.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,It has given me a slow loop that wins lot of points and I feel like I didn't do much.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"As time goes on, I am learning to deal with their weaknesses.Tenergy 64 is distinctly softer than 05 but it never bottoms out."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"The hard Tensors will never bottom out either, but soft ones like F2 or F3, and I suspect Jo Silver, will frequently have that problem.Tenergy rubbers are distincly heavier, 05 being by far the heaviest."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"It may put you off, depending on what kind of blade you use and how sensitive you are to this."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"It was the thing about 05 that I didn't like, I think, though, I might give it another try."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"All Tensors are fragile, but the newest ones are not quite so bad."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Tenergy 64 is also fragile!
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Look at it the wrong way and it crumbles or tears around the edges.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I think 05 MAY be more durable.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,But none of these SGE rubbers are going to last very long.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I meant to say that Tenergy rubbers and Tensor rubbers both have a nice feel when blocking.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,They are equal in my mind.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,It wasn't clear in my last post because of bad editing.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Well, if they aren't really comparable, which rubbers seem to suit which part of the game more?"
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Both Baal and Mars63 put it quite nicely; experienced quite the same thing with Donic (Gold/Silver/Platin), Xiom (Omega II/III), Andro (Roxon 450) and Butterfly (Tenergy 05/25/64).They really seems to work differently, feel differently."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Hitting is quite a lot better with the Tensors, I would agree."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Looping is just average compared to Tenergy.Most of the Tensors I've played with were a bit easier to block with, spin didn't bite as much, I think."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Tenergy - excellent: spin, serve, serve return, durability - blocking and chop ok - more difficult smash - heavier - play satisfactorily in colder temperaturesESN Tensors: average spin, very poor durability - blocking and chop ok - easy smash - lighter - play absolutely unsatisfying in colder temperatures (I was trying for couple of months Roxon 500pro, Platin, Express 1)"
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"I agree with most of this, but ""average spin"" for Tensors?"
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Most tensors with below 45 degree sponge, which is the majority of them, have quite good spin...probably more than most Japanese rubbers."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,and also in any humidity.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,The ball just falls off German rubbers
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"pretty much all tensors below 45 deg will spin better than a similar hardness japanese/chinese rubber imo.Above, the japanese are probably a bit better, and then the chinese again.Of course, this is a bit of a generalisation..."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"The Palio Macro ERA is a Tensor and that gives me plenty of spin, even in the 47.5 degree max sponge."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,The smashing is indeed easy and loaded with power.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Hi Mars, no, I'm not referring to you or Kouros."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I'm just referring to you.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,;pI must admit that I start like Tenergy 05 more and more... Basically because I hurt my wrist (???).
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"I know you'll be like ""what the hell has this got to do liking Tenergy""?"
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Well, I hurt my wrist from last Wed and haven't really recovered so these couple of days I had to force myself to use more arm movement (which is a good thing) and it resulted in more hit driven spins (i.e."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I rely my arm movement to 'hit' the ball but change the bat angle to spin 'mode' JUST before or ON contact).
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,The ball then really explodes with speed and spin...
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,It makes power loop much easier.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I'll try to do that to you on Sat (if you are there and I still remember how to do it...)Another good thing is durability...
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,I accidental hit my bat into the metal net stand today... it was quite hard but only resulted in a line mark on the edge of Tenergy 05.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"If this was on other tensors, it must have been a tear."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"I had a look at the wound, it looks to me that Tenergy has got much higher density on the topsheet (which could have also contributed to the overall weight of the rubber)."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,That's probably what makes it more durable than other tensors.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,It would have also caused a tear in Tenergy 64 based on my experience.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Hi Baal, how do you find T64 on FH?"
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,Does it 'hit' ok?
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"(to me, T05 does not 'hit' OK)"
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"If T05 id not hitting ok for you, then T64 may even be worse for you."
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,For me it is fine.
160,5f6c34b7220a4650ffffdbf2,Tenergy VS Roxon?,"Andro just made a new rubber Hexer.This is supposed to be more spoinnt than Tenergy 05It is also supposed to be better for slow loops and counter loops.Many talks about it beeling even better for everything then Tenergy..I have a mate who uses it, so I will try it on his blade just to see if there is anything about thi snew fuzz.I might be a good tester because i hated Roxon 450 so It will need to be good for me to recommend it.."
161,5f6c34cc220a4650ffffdbff,NEO H2 vs H3 vs TG2 vs TG3,anyway I'm thinking what rubbers are the china team using now... since NEO is still not approved?This has been a discussion in other forums
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,which version of omega 2?omega 2 is grippier.asian sponge is harder -> fastereuro sponge is softer -> slower
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,"If you've used either of the Omega II, and you've used Andro Roxon 450, either of the comparisons would be good."
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,Thanks.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,"Yes I would agree that O2 has a grippier topsheet, however on topspin counters and loops, the O2 sponge (asian) is way way way too fast for the topsheet to do anything."
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,"Whereas the 450 sponge provides really nice mechanical spin.With the O2, I thought the short game was practically impossible except for flicks."
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,Serving short with heavy backspin proved difficult.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,"Speedwise O2>>450, like we're in different orders of magnitude here."
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,Completely agree with O2 asian sponge being too fast to provide any mechanical spin unless you are far away from the Table and hit the ball really hard to sink in the sponge.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,"Of Roxon 450, 500, Omega 2 and 3 asian and european sponges, which ones have roughly the same hardness as Tenergy 05?Cheers."
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,R500 would be the closest.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,My 2cts contribution.I used to played with Globe 999 or Globe Taiphon Gold and more recently the show off Blue Whale II ...A friend of mine gave me a Xiom omega II (european 2mm 40°) and whaou...
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,I'm sticking with it about all the last week.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,The tensor effect is very present and I didn't played with a european rubber since a long time ago.The Xiom permits a lot of control and produce spin and speed on demand.The first time I was confused cause I'm so habit to use tacky rubbers... but the spin is there.The weight is light and people said that my top spin was heavy and difficult to return when I'm physically engaged with this rubber.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,The quality is about butterfly so nice stuff from Korea...
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,"This rubber is really nice to play compare with Blue Whale II, more control and really more playable and constant.Despite I have a tuned version of the Blue Whale II I'm not really impressed with the speed."
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,(if you compare to Tenergy or something really offensive classified).Xiom is really better IMO (but less hype around it...but the price is neither the same)Brahms
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,I think Xiom Omega II is much more durable than Roxon 450 which seems to have very short lifespan.
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,What are other's opinions..?
162,5f6c34d6220a4650ffffdc05,Andro Roxon 450 VS Xiom Omega II?,?
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Only thing stoping me from using Tenergy 05 on FH is cost.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Outlaw works fine for my hitting and blcoking on BH.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,The performance in that department outweigh the fair to poor performance in my opening loops with this rubber.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Outlaw hits and blocks close to the table like a dream.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Since you say you have been hitting with the Outlaw, do you have the same durability issues (tears on edges and bubbling in the center) that the others have been facing?"
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,That is by far the biggest reason I am on the hunt for another rubber with similar properties.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Hello!
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Did you find T64 to be softer or harder than the Outlaw?
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Might be the difference which is affecting your aim when hitting hard, when it's softer than expected."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Very nice review, thanks Metallikviper!"
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Very nice review!
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"A guy I regularly play with, who's been playing for probably 45-50 years and used to be a junior champion many decades ago tried the Outlaw and thought it was o.k., but also experienced a quick decline in performance and major tears around the edge, even on a really light nick on the table."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"He had to replace it after about a month of play.To contrast, I caught my Palio Macro ERA on the table tonight, pretty hard, and while it got scraped on the topsheet, not even close to a tear, and you'd have to look really close at it to even notice."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Made me very glad I didn't have the Outlaw, because from what I saw of his rubber I know it would have been ruined."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,On slower hits they felt about the same but on really fast hits the T64 seemed to be softer than the Outlaw (maybe that's just me).
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,However I once used a Timo Boll ALC with Tenergy 05 on the FH which they say is harder than the T64 and it was absolutely horrendous for smashing.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I know it wasn't the same blade but the ALC is very control oriented and sometimes you know when a rubber is just not right for you.Thanks.I don't even dare to play a shot if I think I might even graze the table or a barrier.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I just chose to lose the point.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Call me cheap, but I know the minute I make contact with anything other than the ball on the Outlaw that is $14 down the drain."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,And from my experience even heavy contact with the ball over 3 weeks has a similar effect  .
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I don't know if you have played with the T64 before but how does it compare to the Palio Macro Era 42.5 or 47.5 deg (preferably from a smashing and loop driving point of view).My pleasure.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,Hope it helps.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"I have not played with Tenergy at all, so I can't give you a comparison."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Love the Palio, will be sticking with that for a long time."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"Hey MV, I now have 5 small tears on my red outlaw 2.0 and they are all along the last 1 or so cm along the edge of the rubber, so the hitting portion of the rubber is still fine."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I don't have any problems with bubbles or broken pips in the hitting area.EDIT: Outlaw would never work on my FH for how I open right now.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I would have to be a mid-distance powerlooper to get the most out of Outlaw on my FH and I am simply not goos enough to play that style yet.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,999 on a mid soft spong is it until I run into something else under $20 that works my way.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I think Outlaw has a manufactors fault and you should ask for your money back lol
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,I wish they would honor it.
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,"But, at this point seeing how well the Outlaw has performed if they even fix their durability issues I would be a happy customer."
163,5f6c34eb220a4650ffffdc14,Gambler Outlaw Vs. Tenergy 64,BTW the sheet out of the packaging looks absolutely beautiful.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Haven't used BW2, but based on spin only I think H3p would win out."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Tried it (unglued) on Mars63's bat and it was wicked.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"I have T05 and while its very spinny, I think it falls short of H3p by a fair bit."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,T05 has the advantage of having good speed as well though.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Not sure if H3p was glued though as haven't tried it.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I think its spin would jump a few more notches though and speed would obviously increase somewhat.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,http://blog.ttrubberman.com/?p=203
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,T05 is better but double the price.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Whale2 is nice needs litle more efort to play than with T05
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I would say it is dependant on the stroke.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Sticky/tacky rubbers CAN impart more spin but I know of a couple of folks where the balls come of nearly dead off a H3!!
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,!
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"now, all things equal."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"H3 would be the ""spinniest"" but under a good player can be made to not spin quite as easily."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Aren't you pretty much the only one here who has tried all three...
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Forgot to add.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I REFUSE to pay $50 freaking dollars for one sheet of rubber.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I don't care if they claim that this is instilled with JO waldners TT soul.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,NOT happening!
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,$50 has become the cheap price Figgie!
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Try $90 plus for Tenergy now!
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,!
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,hahahah...
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I tried Tenergy 05 and BW2 on different blades...
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,and I have never tried old provincial H3 glued... but have tried old provincial H3 unglued
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,and I'm just so curious to find out how others feel about the spin of these 3 rubbers.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I find tacky commercial H3 is good for serving and T05 lose out in that aspect... not sure about provincial version since there is less tackiness.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,ttrubberman rated Tenergy 05 to have more spin than H3... hmmm....
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I wonder if I missed out any other new generation rubbers that is good in spin?
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"I have tried BW2, Tenergy 05 and 64, and H3/H2/Skyline's glued (all commercial)."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Slylines and Hurricanes are the spinniest.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Bw2 spinnier on servers etc than Tenergy and probably just spinnier all round.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Depends how you loop, I am more of a brush looper so didn't like Tenergy."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,say what?
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,?
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,$90 for ONE piece of rubber...
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Absolutely insane, but yet, I bet all the speed gluers are running to them with open wallets."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,lol.

164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Or you have to buy your tenergy from Australia?
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Tenergy 05 currently an insane 53 US dollars per sheet from Butterfly USA.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Pretty much the same here, luckily I stumble upon people who don't like their Tenergy, get it at a used, discounted rate, and have them go back to playing their Tensors."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,But even I just replaced my Tenergy with BWII.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Seems to work better for my distance and capability.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Not too much adjustment, just that Tenergy feels bouncier than BWII, which feels like a 'traditional' Chinese rubber."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Speedwise, Tenergy is faster when driving."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Looping BWII feels explosive as one put it -- a nice crack and the ball shoots out fast.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Albeit I think if there's a way to quantify that, as I'm not sure which of them is actually faster."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Spin-wise, a new sheet of BWII vs. a new sheet of Tenergy, BWII works out a lot easier to spin with, because it feels a fair bit less bouncier than Tenergy."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Easier to serve with, too."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"Can't comment on H3, as I haven't used it in such a long time already."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,Well I will update this.I went to the dark side.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,I now play T05 both sides.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"LolIn short I have played h2bs, bwii, and now T05.The spinniest out of all?"
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,T05 hands down.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,That sponge is definetly assisting in that regards.
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"I have no issues saying that the T05 is (believe me, I was a skeptic) great at producing g spin."
164,5f6c34ef220a4650ffffdc16,Spin: T05 vs BW2 vs old H3,"For those of you that remember, I am talking 38mm ball type top spin where there is massive kick on properly executed loops."
166,5f6c3505220a4650ffffdc24,SRIVER EL VS SRIVER FX,they're both fine on pretty much all blades.EL is just something like 5% harder than FX - and hence has a slightly higher top end/spin.
166,5f6c3505220a4650ffffdc24,SRIVER EL VS SRIVER FX,So you would lose a little control but gain some extra speed when using the EL ?
166,5f6c3505220a4650ffffdc24,SRIVER EL VS SRIVER FX,Not always.
166,5f6c3505220a4650ffffdc24,SRIVER EL VS SRIVER FX,I find the hard sponge= less control thing to be garbage a lot of the time.
166,5f6c3505220a4650ffffdc24,SRIVER EL VS SRIVER FX,The FX will provide extra mech.
166,5f6c3505220a4650ffffdc24,SRIVER EL VS SRIVER FX,"spin, however it will touchy in the short game."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"Mercury is tackier and slower, and has a slower Chinese sponge."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,The Venus is only mildly tacky and has both a faster topsheet and a more springy Japanese sponge.The Superr Soft is slower but with more control.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Throw of the venusis probably a little lower and is less sensitive to incoming spin.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"It really comes down to technique... if you're hitting off the end you need to adjust your stroke to make it dropon... like brush the ball 'up' more than forwards, which will make it spinnier and make it drop more."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Is Venus literally better than Mercury in A LOT of ways?Which one would be better for a OFF+ setup?
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"If you have a fast carbon blade that has a natural low throw, than dont pair it up with a low throw rubber.If the balls going long you can change your stroke simply by closing the angle or taking shorter swings, adding more top helps with it to land on.Personally I like the venus over the mercury."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"I do not have a carbon blade, I have a Donic Opticon RS, which is very quick.What do you recommend now?"
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"I use Venus on the TBS, a carbon/arlyte blade and can't get enough of the ""low"" throw."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Sorry to throw wrenches around your thoughts.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Why not give venus a try for yourself.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,A sheet of it doesn't exactly cost an arm and a leg and it does a lot of the same stuff Bryce did so well.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Just be sure to break it in before forming opinions.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Ill say the venus
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,I use Venus for counter hitting with no problem.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"However, when you say your shots keep going long, changing rubber is not the way to fix it."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"If the rubber is high throw, you close the blade more to compensate.You can change your stroke to go into the ball more."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Do they go long because they fly in a straight line without much arc?
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"That is your tecnique, not the rubber."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"I can switch bats with someone with a totally different rubber with different throw and in a short time, (one minute?)"
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"be hitting the table.I would not start chaseing the ""Magic"" rubber."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"If you have trouble with a slow rubber, faster rubber will not help no matter what the throw is."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"I'm not asking for tips about my backhand, just asking for a comparison between these two rubbers."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"*EDIT: If anyone ever reads this, I realised it was a very rude comment."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Sorry.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"People are volunteering their time here to give you some very good advice here VincentB, so it's not nice to simply dismiss this and tell them that this is not what you're asking  I think your question has been answered anyway, hasn't it?"
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"Sorry about that, it's just that I am already working on my backhand, and it is improving, but I am not changing my rubber solely for trying to improve me backhand.But, yes, thank you all anyway, my question has basically been answered."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,"Ahh I see, no problems I understand."
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Good luck with the backhand
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,O/T - Hey Vince just noticed your in NSW...
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Welcome to the forum mate.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,And I just noticed your post Metal Monkey.
167,5f6c3520220a4650ffffdc38,Galaxy Mercury VS Galaxy Venus,Thanks for the welcome.Where abouts in NSW are you?
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"I never thought i would welcome a lunatic, but here we go: Welcome to the forum, lunaticbulbul."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"I am afraid, I can not compare these rubbers as I have not played Higher III."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"Until someone who might have played both comes along and answers you post, you could go to the Equipment review index and read reviews about them."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"After that you get a feeling for what they are like and how they compare in general.729-08 reviewviewtopic.php?t=4790Higher III reviewsviewtopic.php?t=669viewtopic.php?t=852viewtopic.php?t=1322If you read these, you will get a very good idea, IMHO .Good luck, lunatic"
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"729-8 has a thinner, tackier topsheet and a harder sponge."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"Higher III is soft for a Chinese rubber, average hardness for Jap/Euro."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"Higher III is very grippy, maybe just a tiny bit tacky."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,Both rubbers are very spinny.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,Neither is extremely fast.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"IMO, (some disagree), Higher is a lot faster than 729-08."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"Both are on the heavy side, but not very heavy."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,"If you like the feel of a traditional Chinese rubber but want a little more speed, try 729-08."
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,If you tend to play more mid-distance you'd probably prefer Higher III.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,If you can't decide don't worry.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,The differences aren't so great that you couldn't play with either.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,i actually felt the higher 3 sponge is pretty hard ... probably mid hard for a chinese rubber and extremely hard for a japanese sponge rubber.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,(higher 3 is jap sponge)its a good rubber.. i would call very good if these new rubbers were not available.
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,i have an uncut sheet of 729-08 factory-tuned prov version lying with me.. but i haven't cut it and planning to sell .
168,5f6c3528220a4650ffffdc3c,729-08 vs 729 Higher III ???,i decided to stick with bw2 some time... instead of constantly shifting rubbers and screwing my game.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,"no, it's not more durable."
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,about the same actually.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,T05 has lot more spin and speed is about same.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,they're pretty different rubbers.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX, Yes the speed is in the same general range but they don't play the same at all.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,"BSFX has quite a low throw, is slightly faster, and a good bit lighter."
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,05 is much higher throw and for most people produces a lot more spin.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,Of course it also reacts more to spin.
170,5f6c354e220a4650ffffdc54,Tenergy05 vs Bryce Speed FX,It's also a fairly heavy rubber(almost chinese heavy).
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I have tried IQ and Venus.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"I haven't bought any equipment for several months, so I have no hands on for the Jupiter.In short, Inspirit IQ is a nice allround offensive rubber."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I like it in 40 or 42 degrees for the TBS.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Speed is not overpowering, but acceptabble with nice control."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Not tacky.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Does every shot well.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,VERY thick topsheet.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Notoriously heavy rubber.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"OK with me as I like heavy.Venus shares a lot of the same properties as Bryce, like as in what it does well."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Blocking is good.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Counterhitting is nice.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,All loops work well with excellent mechanical spin.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Good speed on fast drives and powerloops.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Rubber is average lightweight.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Seems to be 2 different sponge hardness floating around.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Soft and mid soft.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Sponge holds some nice energy.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Not tacky at all after some use.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"I've used all 3 with Venus being the least use and IQ the most, but Outlaw the most recent."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I'd have to agree with what Der_Echte said on IQ and Venus.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I used the 39 degree IQ and I would say it has reasonable power but not at all startling.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I'd recommend it up to early-middle intermediate or so.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Or perhaps anyone wanting to play a slower and more tactical game and without outlaying a fortune on rubbers.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Venus is a bit faster and would be the economisers choice for someone wanting more speed up to middle-advanced intermediate level.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Outlaw is the superior rubber on all counts from these three and would be the economisers choice when wanting superior speed and spin without outlaying for a tensor or the like.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"It is a similar hardness to the IQ I had (I think Venus might be a tad harder), but has a nicer feel somehow...perhaps because of its lower weight."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"I have to qualify my statements here by saying I have Outlaw on my very fast Joola R1, whereas I used IQ on a much slower Galaxy K3 and Venus on a Galaxy W6."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"From what others have said and what I have experienced with the Outlaw though, I still think it is a superior rubber to the other two."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,In fact I would go as far as saying its the best Chinese rubber I have used.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"It just does what is asked of it and really doesn't let you down unless you make a really poor stroke, because it is also fairly forgiving despite its fairly low throw."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I think all these rubbers have fairly low throw.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I wouldn't like to rank them as I think it would be a fairly close race.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Not much more I can add except that I have only used any of these rubbers in black max, so my comments only hold true for those criteria rubbers."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"[quote=""Magnus""]I've read a lot of good reviews on these 3 rubbers but can any of you who have at least used two of these rubbers compare them?"
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I find Outlaw max to be better than IQ UL max SV.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"It has way more control, better spin, and doesn't delam from its sponge the way both my sheets of IQ UL have done."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I have used all three (my IQ was 40 degree sponge).
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Here is how I would rank them:Speed (from slowest to fastest):IQVenusOutlawSpin (from least to most spinny):Same as aboveWeight (from heaviest to lightest):Same as aboveOverall (from worst to best):Same as aboveVenus had the most tacky topsheet, but that is not saying much because IQ and Outlaw are non-tacky and Venus is just barely tacky after the first couple of uses."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,@gluelessthat was real neat and precise  ....why didn't i think about it ?
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Forgot.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,IQ (and Venus to an extent) have a real LOW throw I like.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Adjusting to bottomspin can be done by opening the blade a little more if you don't want to go turbo on the stroke acceleration trying to overcome the bottomspin.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,I still think Venus is softer than 39 and 42 deg Inspirit Quattro.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,A 35 degree sheet of Inspirit Quattro is an excellent way to tame those OFF+ blades you make trades for to check out and discover they are WAY too fast.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Thanks for the replies and keep them coming ^_^
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"I tried the Outlaw on Thursday on a mates racket (Geko's) on the Nittaku Rutis, and that thing is a beast."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,Very Fast!!!
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,and I almost fell off my chair when he told me the price.
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Right now I think it's the best value for money, and I can see people spending a lot more for this type of rubber."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Glueless, I agree with your ratings and also, it is the best value for the money out there."
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Yes Glueless, very neat way to put Outlaw in its (deserving) place!"
171,5f6c3552220a4650ffffdc57,Dawei IQ vs Milky Way Venus vs Gambler Outlaw,"Monkey glad you didn't fall off your chair, or you might not been able to play TT."
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Nice comparative review Saltebor, but which Nimbus were you using?"
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,There are about 5 varieties I think.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Sound, Soft, Hard, Medium, Normal/Std."
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Normal
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,you should tune the hammond X it's not a speedglue replacement rubber.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,When tuned it's much better than nimbus and express one
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,...and which Joola Express were you using?
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,One or Two?
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,They are so different...
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I tried both.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Express one on fh and express two on bh.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Express two suits to bh perfectly.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Good control, speed and spin."
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Express One is a nasty weapon.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,You have to adjust your technical skills to perfect to control this rubber.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"If you technically correct, then it will fit your play."
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Excellent spin and speed.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Your opponents will have hard time to block your tops spin.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I have a problem to control this rubber.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Once I switched to Nimbus immediately I got huge relief in terms of control.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Nimbus has different characteristic for speed and spin and has tremendous short play and catapult effect.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I would try Express Two for BH and Nimbus VIP on FH next month.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Will see hot it goes.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Please tell which blade you are using.
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Nimbus is easy to control, but only on stiff blades!"
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Tried it once on an OC and it was a desaster, no control at all!"
172,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I use American Hinoki WRC - which has medium hardness.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Platin is much more spinny and a little softer and therefore much easier to make bh openings.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Gold is like a brick with no spin and hard to make bh openings.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,"I am switching to Platin 1,8 on my bh."
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,in Denmark it is no problem to buy it in 1.8 mm.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,The feel is much better of the Platin.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Gold is like playing with a steelplate  ok for hitting but terrible feel.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Platin is really great for hitting and quite good for aggressive blocks too.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Maybe Haggisv could be pursuaded into stocking it in 1.8 i will sure buy it from him if he would do this.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Haggisv how are sales of these european esn rubbers ?
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,"I hate to disagree, but I much prefer the feel of Gold to Platin, especially for short game."
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Gold is harder but has a lot more gears.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,It may matter a lot what blade you are using or how you play.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,"I use a carbon-arylate blade, and loop from fairly close in (since I play pips on the BF I am forced to use my forehand from closer range than a lot of other people)."
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,I have only used these rubbers in max thickness.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,I can't imagine what they would feel like at 1.8.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,My comments on Gold and Platin obviously refer only to the forehand side.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,I prefer Gold to Platin for the shortgame too.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,My thoughts .....
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,JO Gold has harder feeling sponge than Platin but softer feeling topsheet.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,When you loop with JO Gold the topsheet gives way quickly then the ball bites hard as the sponge resists ...... you can get good spin but need to have a good consistent contact without going too heavily into the sponge.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,With Platin the topsheet and sponge sort of give way together so you definitely have to go into the sponge to find spin.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Strokes feel a bit different (harder sponge brush vs sponge loop) and you just need to see what you prefer.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Anyone agree ?
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,PS If donic are to be believed on their website then Jan Ove uses Platin on BH and JO Gold on FH so they are both valid choices.
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,From the sponge hardness table:
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Donic Coppa JO Gold 36
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Donic Coppa JO Platin 38
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,"So you guys are saying the Platin has a harder sponge, but actually feels/plays softer?"
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,For reference
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Butterfly Sriver FX 37
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Butterfly Sriver EL 40
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,Does JO Gold play softer or harder than Sriver FX?
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,What about Sriver EL?
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,"I am not sure which sponge is actually harder, since I have no scientific way of measuring, but Gold definitely feels harder and yet more responsive in many ways."
173,5f6c35be220a4650ffffdc97,Gold vs Platin and Platin soft?,More gears.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,That would be regular platin right Silver?
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I don't think you quite answered the question.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,So is your assessment the same for comparing Roxon 450 and Platin soft?
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,Slippery would you like to have my other sheet of roxon 450 ?
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,You can have it really cheap or perhaps switch for some other rubber.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,PM if you are interested.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"I will report back, but I still is struggling with inverted too so I will need to have 2 active setup`s ."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,But I have decided to test it soon along with my Tenergy 05 might be a nice setup.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"I have not played with Platin, but did play with Roxon 500 2.0mm."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I found it to be surprisingly slow and dead.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I much preferred the Plasma 430 2.0mm with which I able to loop faster and spinnier compared to the Roxon.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"Problem with Plasma is that the edges of the rubber break off (chip) very, very easily."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I'm currently playing with Tenergy 05 and like it much more than either the Roxon or Plasma.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"Slip, I'll be very keen to hear how Roxon 450 plays on Wavestone."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I came very close to just ordering one of these things to see why you think its so special.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,But I backed out of it lol.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,Might be still tempted if I know the Tensors do work well on it.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"If I'd ordered one, it would have been the new one as it sounds much more to my liking with its balanced feel."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,Silly Speedplay!
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,Of course I have!
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I didn't really find much difference between the 450 and the PS in practice.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,Could quite easily subsitute one for the other.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"I found the difference between the two had the roxon being slightly gripper, but softer than the PS."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,"Just to reiterate: I'd take the 450 over the PS, but I'd take the Platin over the 500."
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I really didn't get along with 500 for some reason...
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,Me too!
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,I think its a conspiracy by the TT manufacturers to get rich.
175,5f6c35d5220a4650ffffdca7,Platin vs Roxon?,They changed the acceptable price range for rubbers without us even realising!
176,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,Thats not a hard-and-fast rule.
176,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,"I personally have 729 God Favored SST, and it works wonder on my Septear."
176,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,I'd give LKT rapid power or speed a shot.
176,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,"Well, last time I tried both of them, I felt T05 was slightly harder, faster and spinnier but with less dwell."
176,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,It also threw a lot higher than Bryce Speed did.
176,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,I didn't try it on a hinoki blade though...
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Sorry Jolan, I am not infected by the rubber virus, so I know only Donic Desto series."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Your review interests me, but please tell me who is the manufacturer of the JO Silver."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Do you think that given the choises between F1 and JO Silver you would take the JO Silver ?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,And the sponge is max ?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,JO Silver is also made by Donic.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"There's a lot of hype around this rubber and from your review it also sounds very nice, although I'm not sure why it doesn't work well on BH from your experience."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Pls update us with your further test with it!
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,This is almost exactly what one of our local players experienced... he changed from Mark V 30deg glued both sides.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"He also found the Gold much better on the backhand, and the Silver worked really well on forehand."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I persoanlly liked the Silver the best for my FH too, and it actually played similar to the Mark V 30deg glued, although a little firmer..."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Still I prefer tacky rubbers, so I have not changed..."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"For my forehand loop, I definitely prefer JO Coppa Gold to F1 or F2, I find my loops have more power and definitely drive people back more effectively, but I lose nothing in terms of ability to keep the ball on the table."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It is fantastic for short over the table looping.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I liked it better than F1 from the first time I tried it (and at that time I didn;t think I would find anything I liked better than F1).
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Where it really shines for me is return of serve, where interestingly the harder sponge on the JO Gold gives me some interesting options that I couldn't pull off with the softer F1."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I have never tried JO Silver, I have heard it is quite nice, but a bit higher in throw angle and not quite as fast."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I use a somewhat softer blade (BTTFLY Viscaria, an arylate/carbon hybrid)."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Another plus is that JO Gold is MUCH more durable than F1 or F2.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"One thing I would be curious to try at some point is F1 HS, I seem to be gravitating towards harder sponges these days for my forehand, and softer for my short pips backhand."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Since I use short pips on my BH, I can't really say, but I suspect F2 would be nice on that side for inverted loopers."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,So the Silver is slower than the Gold ?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"It's only a little slower, but the sponge is quite a bit softer..."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,How is the speed of Silver compared to F1 ?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Nothing exceptional there.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Untill I met F1 I've never had same rubbers both FH/BH.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,But what puzzles me is that usually I pick up softer rubbers on Bh compared to FH.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Here it's otherway round.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Next test tonight !
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Well that's why I say 2 gears.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"On slow show, short game, it's slower, more controlable, on loops and tough drives, it's faster."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"It behaves like a real speed glue sheet, except that it hasn't the bothering bounciness of speed glue for short game(dunno if I make myself clear...  )"
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Well, looks like both Gold & Silver versions are very good rubbers, which makes it harder to choose now"
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Yeap, that's exactly what they are."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,However my second session tells me they are not representing a significant improvement compared to former generation F1/F2.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Tonight I played against a much better ranked guy than yesterday's partners and I suffered a lot untill I lost closely 3-2.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Couldn't control the ball properly.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Nothing exceptional there considering I'm not fully acquainted to my new babes.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,The guy gently offered a new match and I took my second setup with both F1 in order to give him a better opposition and that's what I did...winning easily 3/0.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,No conclusion to take out of that though.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"The rubbers are not to be blamed, it's me that couldn't take the best out of them."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I should receive a second hand Korbel soon.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I suspect these fast babes being more comfortable on a slightly slower blade.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Experiment to be continued...
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I had a different experience, my game improved from the first time I switched from F1 to JO Coppa Gold, no doubt about it."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"There is a noticeable difference, and I personally prefer the slightly harder sponge on my relatively soft blade."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"At one point I tried a sheet of F1 again after playing with JO Gold for a month or so, and it really sucked."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Now I am confused
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"One difference may be that my blade is quite soft, so the harder sponge may suit it better, or it could simply be a difference in the way Jolan and I hit the ball, which would be hard to know without watching both of us play."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Or, there is simply the question of, as Jolan might say, ""chacun son goût"""
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Sometime back in the archives I wrote a detailed comparison of F1 and JO Gold after about a year of playing with the former and a few weeks after switching to the later.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"One thing that really surprised me was how much better I returned serve with Gold, and I really preferred its slightly lower throw angle."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"One thing is without doubt, after using several sheets of both kinds of rubber over the last several years --- Gold and (I assume) Silver are more durable than the Desto series (F1, F2, F3), but they are still relatively fragile compared to non-Tensor rubbers."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,F1 will crumble around the edges if you talk to it in a nasty tone of voice.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Baal: Your previous comments really caught me attention - I keep going back to read it to confirm what I've read  .
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I've been thinking about getting the regular JOW, but JO Gold is really appealing due to it's control and speed potential."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Is the topsheet of JO Gold as grippy as I imagine it is, e.g."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,similar to the regular JOW?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,And is it also quite good for over the table play?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Suma, by over the table do you mean on top of the table or far from the table ?"
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I am glad that I am not the only one who cannot resist this temptation.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I'd answer if I knew how grippy regular JOW was, but I've never played with or even seen a sheet."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"JO Gold is certainly not tacky, and it's grip on the ball is similar to F1, or maybe just a touch more."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Some of the tack that it does have seems to wear off fairly quickly, which is my one complaint."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Like F1, it gets a dull color after a week or so, and as they claim, this has very little effect on its playing characteristics."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Little, but not zero."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"If I was a rich or professional player, I would change about once per week."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"As it is, I change about every six weeks, but that is true for about every rubber I have used."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Spinmax has no effect on this feature of JO Gold or how it plays.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I like it from any distance from the table.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I play a bit closer than most loopers owing to the SP on my backhand, but I'm also six feet tall, so that means anatomical considerations mean I have to drop to at least mid distance fairly often and the stuff is great either way."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I almost never drop farther than that except when goofing around.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"However, my clubmates who have switched at my urging are all guys who loop from considerable distance on occasion."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Anyway, I am a big fan of tensor rubbers except F2 and F3 (too mushy), but JO Gold is my favorite so far."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Regular JOW is like Coppa, or Sriver, or Mark V. That range of grippiness."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It's a different sort of grip to Coppa Jo gold; it's pretty much your japanese type grip vs your esn tensor type grip - they're pretty different.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Aeoliah: I meant essentially on top of the table (or so I understood from the comment).
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"That kind of grip is probably too much to expect from a tensor , although I notice some Euro/Jap players are able to loop on top of the table, albeit not frequently."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Mmm .. JO Gold still sounds very good, but looks like the grippiness isn't what I imagined - would be nice if it had Sriver type of grip."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I tried F1 briefly for casual play, and I remember it couldn't spin that well."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Well, I guess there are always trade-offs to be made."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"However, knowing it's good from all distances make it a very appealing candidate for me."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"In the interest of full disclosure, one of the really high end players in my club -- USA 2560, former US team -- said he thought the JO Gold felt nice but not quite as spinny as he might like."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"However, it was an old sheet."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Now there is another one : Coppa Platinum.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,What can be the difference ?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Looks like it's a fastest, hardest and most durable version of the three."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Targeted for those who like to play with speed-glued hard sponge ... Yum!
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Donic's marketing blurp says:
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"A wolf in sheep's clothingAt first, this rubber sheet may seem a modest development on the COPPA JO Gold from Jan-Ove Waldner, but as soon as it has been glued to the blade, this ""grenade"" sets an entirely new benchmark.- COPPA JO PLATIN is definitely the fastest and spiniest rubber in the FORMULA DONIC series with incorporated speed glue effect.- COPPA JO PLATIN develops extreme dynamics when playing slightly off from the table.- The sound and speed glue feeling of the COPPA JO PLATIN are in a class of their own.- The bounce of the ball with the COPPA JO PLATIN is both longer and higher and this improves control and increases speed.- The new top sheet, despite its enormous speed, allows good touch for short balls, spin, serves and returns.- The durability of COPPA JO PLATIN has been improved considerably.COPPA JO PLATIN is superior to its competitors in all important aspects."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It really deserves the Platinum label.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,A real wolf in sheep's clothing!
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,We recommend the new DONIC COPPA JO PLATIN from Jan-Ove Waldner to the following players: The harder Coppa JO Platin is predominantly recommended for those players who used to use speed glue for medium to hard sponges.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,You want to achieve maximum power and the highest speed?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Then Coppa JO Platin is the right choice.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Perfectly suited for top players, too."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Edit: Oh, they also have a soft sponge version."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Seems like a very good rubber.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Anyone has tried it ?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Sigh.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I guess I will have to try it.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I guess you are the best person for it
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I had my third session yesterday and....it is very puzzling.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,This time I took both gold and silver on my clipper.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I had the idea they would behave differently on a more rigid/solid blade and they did.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Silver (tenderer and a bit slower than F1) suddenly became a BH dream and Gold (harder and a bit faster than F1) married perfectly clipper FH.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"F1 on clipper was quite deceptive, nothing more than OK. Coppas are great."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I defeated every oponents very safely.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Very rare with a new set up.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I finally understand what's Baal was explaining about JO coppa gold.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"It is all in all, a tad harder, safer, faster than F1."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"On a slow game, it brings security, less bouncy."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"On fast game, power comes quickly (sometimes too quickly, be careful)."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"However, beware to the blade."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It looks like these rubbers prefer stiffer blades.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Especially Silver.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Silver feels 90% like a soft speed-glued rubber.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Frankly, no need to bother any longer with SG or boosters."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"To those who are looking for a valid alternative, give it a try."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Let's see in the long term whether the effect lasts and if it's not too fragile.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Dear Aeoliah, I'm sorry if I bring some extra confusion into your actual reflexion, but if EJing was a simple matter, it wouldn't be so funny !"
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Nice input.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,How heavy are these sheets?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Medium?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Comparable to Sriver?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Is the Gold version decent for soft/opening loop?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I don't know how my Viscaria compares to a Clipper.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"To me it feels soft because of the arylate, but it also has carbon and it is certainly a fast blade."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,But it seems that Jolan and I are getting the same feel with the rubbers.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Anyway, these rubbers are expensive over time but worth it, and I think they are the best choice after the glue ban."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"One other thing in favor of all the tensors -- because you are not regluing them, they are consistent from day to day."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"NO more worries about your play affected because of a ""bad glue day""."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"My most recent sheet of Coppa Gold was attached to my blade with Joola Green Power glue (not a speed glue, and water based), it plays great, actually I like this glue because it attaches the rubber quite firmly."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I am starting to believe that conventional speed glues actually degrade the playing characteristics of tensor rubbers, and without doubt shorten their life time."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Dropped by the store and couldn't resist the urge, especially the manager offered a sheet of the gold version at the price of Sriver."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"It looks like a very high quality rubber, with nice grippy topsheet and med-hard sponge."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Weight is med-heavy, but gives a solid feel to the blade, which is nice."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"However, rubbing the cut-out part against the table pretty much destroys the topsheet (pits or deep crack down to the sponge), so durability seems to be the main concern."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"If the platinum one is much more durable, I'd probably change to that later."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Sorry guys (and gal), one more for the road....Sonex JP Gold."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It might reconciliate the all family and give a clear winner.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"For F1 lovers who where looking for an upgraded version (that's me  ), it is it !"
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Clearly softer than coppa gold and harder than silver.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"It has greater speed glue effect than both (yes, possible !)."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It's bouncier without being too bothering for short game.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Ark low, throw low, it just passes the net at opponents despair  ."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Ok, one more tensor, you're gonna say !"
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Not quite, my friends."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,There's something new here....: SPIN !
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I was complaining for years about tensor's lack ok spin.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"Ok, I was able to put decent amount in my loops, but nothing's special."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"This one, without being noticeably more tacky, offers an extra grippiness and my loops, slow opening or fast killing were definitly spinnier."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Ouch !
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I was about to forget sound.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,It's loud !
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"pling, pling on acoustic."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I'll try on clipper next friday, it might be even louder."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"When I was blocking (very safely, I must say), club mates stopped and watched in wonder."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"In short, my next rubber with acoustic FH."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,I'll keep silver on clipper.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,And gold on Korbel.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Until I change my mind...
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Nice summary of the donic tensors jolan!
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"I currently have Desto F2 on my FH, and I'm considering: a) keeping it b) changing it to either Jo Silver or Joola Express 2."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,"What I like about the F2 is the effect of the topspin (the possibility to open with slow spins with much effect and good placement), as well as the possibility to hit through the ball ánd the effect (which is almost the opposite kind of attack, really)."
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,What I don't like is its short lifespan and the short game.
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,Would the Jo Silver be a suitable update to the F2 for me?
177,5f6c35e6220a4650ffffdcaf,Coppa Jo gold vs Coppa Jo Silver vs F1,What are the differences?
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,Mark V
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,Mark V is much faster but the spin is much less than Tackfire.
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,The MarkV would have to be faster but from the 2 rubbers I prefer Tackifire D.... Mark V is more like Sriver speed
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,How about Mark V vs good old Sriver L?
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,Is MarkV capable of producing more spin?
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,Is it about the same in terms of speed?
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,I think its a tradeoff.
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,"MK V is a little spinnier, but is only as fast with a little less control then sriver."
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,"The real king of the ""Klassic"" rubbers is Coppa."
179,5f6c3608220a4650ffffdcc1,Mark V vs Tackifire Drive,"Its both faster and spinnier then both the above mentioned, with the hard sponge giving great control (for me)."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"I tried the 999/quattro from Rossicarbon, very good quality coming from Cole."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"It's fast and spinney, but too bouncy for me when I play shortgame, and the weight is heavy, but I guess similar to the other rubbers you suggested."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,For a BH rubber I would prefer the 729Cream on MRS sponge
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,You will like any of your own suggestions.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Cream MRS or Quattro are nice on BH.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"If you can get 42/44 deg Quattro, that is even better."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,I got my 42 deg from Rob at Affordable.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Both Rob and One of a Kind Trading sell 42 Deg Quattro.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Give 42 deg a try.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Cole only sells only 40 deg Quattro.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,He does sell 42 deg in Quattro Ultra Light and he does put 999 on a 42 deg Quattro sponge - one of my FH rubbers.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,I just stuck a black sheet of it on the Timo Boll Spirit.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Nice FH rubber - just watch out for how it reacts to spin.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Cream MRS on FH or BH on the Galaxy T-8 isn't bad either.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Cream MRS shapes up to be a nice allround offensive rubber.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,It takes anywhere from 7-10 days to get a rubber from OZ to the States normally.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"I have ordered from Cole, Rob and Haggisv."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,You will get your goods at a nice price from any of them.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,42 deg Quattro has a nice offensive capabilty.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,It counters and blocks almost as good as Bryce (like a Cat hair less) does for way less money.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Tested out 999 on quattro today and it was horrible.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Thought I enjoyed the Dawei Inspirit Quattro on my backhand.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Could it be the blade?
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,I have both these on a LKT Instinct+.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,I really HATE the handle.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"I only used that combo on the Dawei GTS (OFF -), the Timo Boll Spirit (OFF), and the Galaxy T-8 (OFF to OFF+) and liked each one."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"Right now, I got 999 on a 35 degree sponge on my GTS and 999 on a 42 degree sponge on my TBS."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,I never used the Instinct and I think it is not such a big price difference for the GTS.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"If I had any kind of reliable/speedy mail over here, I would offer to trade you a red one week old Inspirit Quattro 40 degree sheet for your 999/42 Quattro rubber that you don't like."
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,I have a sheet of much more used black Inspirit Quattro.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,You can't get the 2.0 for $32 from the same place?
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,No.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,They only carry in 2.2.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,Also I just rather spend less on an alternative and found the Inspirit Quattro for 16 dollars.
180,5f6c3619220a4650ffffdccc,BH: Inspirit Quattro vs. Cream MRS,"Half the price and in my opinion, a little better."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Different people have different interpretations.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"But like most other people, to me takcy=sticky, and grippy is just grippy"
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"To me, sticky/tacky is when you can pick a ball up with it."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Wont pick up a ball?
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Grippy.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"Could also be Anti, SP, LP or MP Hookshot."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Good point Reb !
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"Actually Slippery, I never said those things couldn't be grippy."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,I merely point out what they could be if they wouldn't hold a ball.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"I think your mindset is one of challenge always, but I wasn't necessarily challenging Hookshot, but adding further descriptives."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,My understanding was chinese rubbers were sticky and typically had harder sponges.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Whereas Japenese rubbers tended to be tacky usually having softer sponges.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"Grippy is a term that can be applied to long or short pips to indicate some chance to generate your own spin, and hence a greater reaction to spin."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Japanese rubbers aka BTY rubbers are generally only grippy in my experience Anti.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Tackiness chop really isn't tacky.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"I think it was when they first invented it, but it changed direction in its development but the kept the name."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,I don't think Grippiness Chop would sound so appealing LOL.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,To me tacky and sticky are the same thing.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,The only difference I might allocate is where one rubber that is tacky holds the ball for a second or two.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,A sticky rubber might hold it for a minute or never let it go without some influence.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,    Are very important in e-mail as tone cannot be read.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"There, you are not now last post in this thread speedy."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"BTW, i know what you mean re- pet peeves!"
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Yep that's how I interpret is as well...
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"I usually use plastic sheet to determine (non-adhesive)... if it sticks (really sticks) it's tacky, otherwise it's grippy or non-grippy..."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,That's a great acid test Haggisv!
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"Place a plastic film, something that not sticky like a one sided glue sheet sorta thing, more of a projector sheet."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"Place it on a tacky rubber and it sticks and removes all the air bubbles,"
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,place it on a grippy rubber straight out of the packet like a almana or a sriver and the sheet simply falls off.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,As for tacky vs grippy - that a question that won't be answered as it's more up to the individual prefrence of choice.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,I think he meant whether people prefer to use tacky or grippy rubbers is a matter of personal preference...
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,so im guessing that the geospin tacky its tacky as in sticky as in able to pick up the ball?????
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,and in pick up the ball do you mean that when i press the rubber against the ball on the table it sticks to the rubber like scotch tape?
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"That means when i play, i just need to hold my bat still and let the balls curve into my rubber and then all i need to do is move my hand forward??"
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,?
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Real problem is all the balls from the other courts keep coming in to yours.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,Good way to collect balls for multiball though.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"haha yeah, well seriousl, when it comes to picking up balls, what is the difference between tacky/sticky or grippy?"
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,TELL ME!
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,!
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,No need to yell Lehman.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"A tacky rubber will pick up a ball to some degree, be it a second or a minute."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,A grippy one won't.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"haha thnx reb,"
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,sry.
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"but well on the packaging of my rubber it says that it produces astounding ""mechanical"" spin."
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,what is mechanical spin?
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,is it just a posh term to describe spin?
181,5f6c3623220a4650ffffdcd2,Tacky vs. Sticky,"Mechanical spin means it's grippy, not tacky."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"Speed: Roxon 500, JO Gold."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"COR/COR2 maybe.Spin: Roxon 450, Platin."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"Tenergy is pretty hard compared to most Tensors, with little dwell time."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,The feel is quite different.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,The hardness of Tenergy is about comparable to JO Coppa Gold from Donic (which is one of the harder Tensors).
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"Gold is a little faster, Tenergy is spinnier and has a much higher throw angle."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,Tenergy felt A LOT heavier.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"I suspect that Tensors like Joola Express 1, are more or less like JO Gold."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,Platin is pretty hard too.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,Most other Tensors are very much softer.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"None of these rubbers, Tenergy included, are much like Chinese sponge."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,I suspect the versions of Tenergy that will come out later (and that are currently being used by some pro players) such as Tenergy 25 and Tenergy 64 will be more like Chinese sponge.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,A Tensor that might appeal to Chinese sponge users is Donic F1 HS (HS stands for Hard Sponge version).
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,It is said to be designed that kind of player.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"In the interests of full disclosure, that is based on the Donic description, I have not tried it myself."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"hmm, how about soft tensors?"
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,i very much like the feel of it.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,F1 regular is pretty soft.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,So is JO Silver and JO Platin SOft.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,F2 is even softer still.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"If you want something positively mushy, you could try F3 or F3 Big Slam."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,"All of these are from Donic, all are tensors, and I suspect most of the other companies have essentially equivalent stuff under a different name."
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,I happen to have tried more of the Donic rubbers since they made the first tensor that I ever used (the old F1).
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,All of the above will feel soft and light coming off of Chinese sponge.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,I use JO Gold now.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,It is relatively hard.
182,5f6c366a220a4650ffffdcff,Tensor vs Tenergy,I like everything about it except its durability.
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,This is a good question considering the number of defenders that use Globe 999.
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,I think the Juic rubbers are worth looking into if your are looking to use your forehand as part of the defensive toolkit.
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,"The problem I see with Globe is that ok the defender is long or mid-distance, the attacker switches the attack to the defenders forehand - a very common ply - what stroke now?"
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,"Globe 999 is good for a diagonal block in this situation (Weixing Chen and particularly BH play this alot), the defender could counter loop (which is probably what Haggisv does) - but I think it would be tough to chop unless you are going to twiddle and place this on the pips."
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,"Juic 999 defender type rubbers could increase your options here, the counter looping will not be strong but the ability to vary the spin should be stronger."
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,I think we need some help here from Twinkle who played with 999 Elite Defense.
183,5f6c366b220a4650ffffdd00,Globe 999 vs. Juic 999 Defense vs. Juic 999 Elite Defense,"From what I've heard, elite series are JUIC made, regular 999 are globe's best cuts, but I don't know about the sponge differences on those rubbers."
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,I disagree totally with you regarding huge arm swings for TG2 no 19.
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,"My coach said on Thursday how compact my swing has become since switching to TG"" no 19"
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,I recall TG3 being more tacky than H2...
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,This thread does not include TG2 no 19.
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,well maybe...
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,"but unless there are a few TG3 #21 blue to compare with the H2 #19, it would not be accuracy."
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,DHS products are inconsistent and this have to be factored in for tackiness.
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,"Anyway, this thread is purely for the new TG3 #21 blue and H2 #19."
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,I'm not comparing against other new or old DHS products.
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,There is a also a TG3 #21 orange which I'm not including in this comparison.
184,5f6c3672220a4650ffffdd05,H2 #19 vs TG3 #21 blue,"So, I don't expect a lot of responses since not many have tried these 2 new products."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Although I have not played with the Nanocannon, from the feedback I got I deduce:"
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"999 EU is mildly tacky whereas the nanocannon is completely non-tacky, so the 999 EU would be spinnier on most things, except perhaps faster loops."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,The nanaocannon is much faster than the 999 EU
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,The 999 EU is a little softer from memory...
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Both are softer and slower than your Tenergy.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"999EU should be slightly spinnier than your tenergy, but not in hard loops."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"He mentioned the Nanocannon, not the Elite Nano  Not sure if that's the one he meant though..."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Elite is spinnier than Nano Cannon.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Nano is much faster than Elite.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Elite is higher throw than Nano.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Nano is a great rubber for a counter loop and loop drive type game.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Thanks for the answers!
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Ok, Elite Ultima is spinnier than Nanocannon but would you still call Nanocannon a spinny rubber compared to most rubbers?"
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,And how does it perform vs Tenergy?
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,How hard is the sponge from Nanocannon?
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,i think silver is getting Pissed off  this was in one of his 'what pisses me off list'
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,There's no evidence I said EN now
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Anyway, what I said still stands true."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,They're pretty far apart as far as comparison rubbers go...
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Nanocannon is fairly spinny.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Not the most spinny grippy rubber I've ever tried though, but maybe top 25%..."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Is Nanocannon spinnier than Couga?
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,How do their sponges compare?
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"It's certainly meant to be spinnier, and a little slower."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,From memory the sponge is slighly softer on the nanocannon.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Hmm I think I will try Elite Ultima.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,In max it should be fast on my Joo blade.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Maybe not as fast as my Tenergy but still fast...
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,My Defense should be safer and even spinnier with it.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Yes, comparing these two is not fair."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Elite is NOT fast when compared to Nano, Bryce, Tenergy, or even Venus."
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,Nano is spinny when talking about counter looping or the fast game.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,It is not made for brushing.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,I can brush with it but it does not compare with tacky rubbers.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,These are made for two different games.
185,5f6c367e220a4650ffffdd0c,Elite Ultima vs Nanocannon,"Thanks, you helped me alot"
186,5f6c3689220a4650ffffdd13,Champion Apache vs Omega series,Apache came out well before Omega did.
186,5f6c3689220a4650ffffdd13,Champion Apache vs Omega series,"OK, thanks."
186,5f6c3689220a4650ffffdd13,Champion Apache vs Omega series,Have you tried the Apache?
186,5f6c3689220a4650ffffdd13,Champion Apache vs Omega series,"If so, would you recommend it or should i look to the Omega range instead?"
186,5f6c3689220a4650ffffdd13,Champion Apache vs Omega series,"Also there seems to be an ""old"" and an new Omega range as far as I can see."
186,5f6c3689220a4650ffffdd13,Champion Apache vs Omega series,Do you know what the difference is?
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,Inspirit Quattro at his best is a heavier version of Sriver ...
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,What if we comopare IQ UL?
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,It much lighter than the usual IQ and has built in speed glue effect.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,Is it still comparabl to Sriver or a little faster and spinnier?
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,Too bad...
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,"I thought so, but I hoped it could be something like a cheap Tenergy replacement..."
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,i think its too much a strech...
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,tenergy is made for playing without glue...
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,teneregy seems to be better than tensor bios like andro roxon...
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,which are supposed to be better than tensors like old desto f series...which are also made for glueless TT
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,tensors seem to have an edge over tuned rubbers...
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,which are better that tensioned rubbers ... which have light glue effect and may avoid multiple layers of glue but still need glue.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,and then comes IQ or IQUL which as per experienced members play nice with glue.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,Don't fool yourself.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,There is no cheap replacement for Tenergy.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,In my experience only Sword King is a match for euro/jap rubbers regarding bouncyness and speed.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,But speed-glue effect only tensors (ESN made) have.
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,"Although I agree there's probably no comparision between IQ and Tenergy, I also think it only suits a certain range and style of players, and I doubt it's the answer for the majority of players..."
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,"I think it's always worth reminding ourselves that we're all at different levels and play different styles... so Tenergy may be perfect for one, but a poor choice for others..."

187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,"As it is, monkeys are quite uncontrollable beast so they need something to slow them down."
187,5f6c368b220a4650ffffdd15,Inspirit Quattro vs Tenergy,Just ask Metal Monkey to confirm

188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,I agree that Optimum MP is faster.
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,I'm not entirely sure about spinnier.
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,"I reckon the topsheets are almost identical, but the mendo mp sponge was a bit softer."
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,I can't make any comments about weight - i've only got 1 opt mp and 3 mendo mp samples in my db.
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,"The opt mp was max, the mendos were 2.0..."
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,"Oh yeah, I guessed that one right!"
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,I was thinking (way back) that Optimum MP was a bit like Almana sponge with a different topsheet.
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,Now it's the Mendo MP topsheet.
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,Hehehe.
188,5f6c36a1220a4650ffffdd24,Optimum MP vs Mendo MP speed?,"I'm like, how can they rate the Almana sponge to be slower than the Mendo sponge?"

190,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"Yes, mostly in the short game."
190,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,The topsheet feels like a high grip (and harder) Bryce Speed topsheet.
190,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,2.
190,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,The Tenergy *should* feel softer and springier from midrange.
190,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"That being said, I haven't used Bryce Hard unglued."

194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,I can only speak to IQ UL and unfortunately can't compare to any of the rubbers you listed--so this may be utterly worthless.
194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,But I'm currently madly in love with IQ ultralight on my BH.
194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,"I play a close to the table style and need a BH rubber that allows me to block with good speed, receive serves, and put some kick into loops."

194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,"IQ UL seems to be that rubber--again, at least for me."
194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,I have it in 1.8 thickness with a 40 deg sponge and am loving it.
194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,"Previous BH rubbers that the IQ UL replaced included Focus III, LKT Pro XT, Palio CJ8000 36-38 sponge, Cream on MRS, and regular old 729 w/ blue sponge."
194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,what chinese rubber u use on FH?
194,5f6c36f3220a4650ffffdd59,Inspirit Quattro Lights vs highpoint,"I use Galaxy Venus, 2.0, 38 sponge."

195,5f6c36f4220a4650ffffdd5a,TG2 vs SP Transcend vs H3 pro blue vs 40H jap,I think you're better off getting one of each sheet and testing them for yourself

195,5f6c36f4220a4650ffffdd5a,TG2 vs SP Transcend vs H3 pro blue vs 40H jap,just kidding
195,5f6c36f4220a4650ffffdd5a,TG2 vs SP Transcend vs H3 pro blue vs 40H jap,40H is very heavy - so forget it !
195,5f6c36f4220a4650ffffdd5a,TG2 vs SP Transcend vs H3 pro blue vs 40H jap,I found Hurricane 3 (common orange version) to be good enough for any strokes.
195,5f6c36f4220a4650ffffdd5a,TG2 vs SP Transcend vs H3 pro blue vs 40H jap,Is a powerful weapon - the ball gets an incredible acceleration when looping.

199,5f6c3764220a4650ffffdd9b,Coppa Silver vs. Plasma 430,I would certainly choose silver.
199,5f6c3764220a4650ffffdd9b,Coppa Silver vs. Plasma 430,"The silver is much softer than Plasma, and is has gretat tensor effect."
199,5f6c3764220a4650ffffdd9b,Coppa Silver vs. Plasma 430,I have just bought the Silver and i just love it.
199,5f6c3764220a4650ffffdd9b,Coppa Silver vs. Plasma 430,You will not regret it.
199,5f6c3764220a4650ffffdd9b,Coppa Silver vs. Plasma 430,It also have great power a little away from the table.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Much the same.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I'd go JO though.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I think Coppa is significantly lighter.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Is this true?
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,"I'm also interested in Donic/Nittaku JOW and Nodias, but weight is a concern if they weigh similar to traditional Chinese rubbers."
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Would be great if they weigh similar to Sriver.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,The weight is that made with to think to a nontacky setup.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,If the weight of Coppa or Nittaku JOW are around the chinese rubbers there is not much deal though ...
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,"If you're looking to drop the weight significantly from your current set-up, then you prob."
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,"should consider other rubbers, or slightly thinner sponge."
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,"My impression is that Juic Drive Smash Ultima, Nittaku Moristo 2000, Yasaka Xtend are also good candidates."
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,not sure what you're talking about my sheets of nittaku jo max weight 41 gms per sheet.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,"Vali, looks like you've found the rubber you're looking for."
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I read about some variation between Nittaku's and Donic's; I guess Nittaku's is lighter?
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I thought it was the other way around.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I hope so.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I always thought that Nittaku rubbers are heavy.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Can compare Donic JO Waldner with Coppa in 2mm / 2.1mm black.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,JO is lighter despite having a harder sponge.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,This is due to it having a thinner topsheet than the Coppa.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,41g for 2mm cut black JO is about right (40 to 42g variation).
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Red JO plays harder.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Comparing Coppa to JO is a bit like comparing Sriver EL to Sriver L ...... its a bit slower and softer and is better for over the table pushes than JO but JO has better speed and punch and is very good for BH loop.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,They are similar but not the same.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,Coppa comes in more like 43g cut sheet (red or black) and has a slightly higher arc than JO.
200,5f6c3766220a4650ffffdd9c,Donic Coppa vs Nittaku JOW,I like JO on BH; Coppa more on FH.
201,5f6c377f220a4650ffffddaa,"Kokutaku 868 China soft 1,5 (30-35°) vs Tackiness C",The 868 topsheet is a lot harder and thicker.

202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,LKT XT glued was my best BH rubber ever and Hur3 for the FH....
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"When I gave up speed gluing, I moved to Sriver El both side and now EL FH + Cermet BH."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Recently am thinking about going back to the old setup.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I'm thinking, now that I've progressed skill wise, I might have the proper stroke and power to use the old setup again without speed glue."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I'm missing the tackiness of the chinese rubbers.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Also because of the chinese setup being more economical (initial cost and running cost - being last longer on average).
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"LKT XT is 2.67 times cheaper than Sriver EL, and 4.67 times cheaper than the Cermet."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Geospin Tacky is the same price as LKT XT so I might change the Hur3 to Geospin Tacky or LKT XT or Lightening (a bit cheaper than the other two).
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Back then it didn't occur to me to try out the XT on my FH so I don't know how it'll be on the FH.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"So, back to the original question: how are these three rubbers compared to one another?"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I'm thinking about using either 1 or 2.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"If I pick one, then I'll go with hur3 as the other rubber."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Hur3 is about 1.5x the price.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I only had a brief hit with the LKT XT, and another brief play with the Geospin Tacky/H3."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I like the Geospin/H3 more than the XT, maybe because it's tackier IMHO."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I'm not exactly particular on the price -- as you mentioned, you aren't planning on gluing again, so the price of glue could be chipped in to get a more expensive rubber if needed."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"As for the differences, IMHO, H3 and Geospin are closer to each other than XT."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I guess XT is somewhat faster than the two forementioned.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Do you still have some life in the old H3 sheets?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"If you're concerned about price, why not give those sheets a try first?"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,You did mention playing with H3 on FH previously...
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I hope I was of some help.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I think the other guys could chip in their ideas.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I`ve been using XT recently both glued and non-glued, FH/BH."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"If you like real Chinese-tackiness, 2-sided XT may not be the best as the red one is a bit less tacky than the black (I had the red one as FH)."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,The spin the red provided was good though.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,The tackier black one is not too bad even unglued for controlled play but I guess you really need a fast blade to support it.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I`ve just used it on a Galaxy W6 BH unglued yesterday, works well, but I needed to put some more arm-power into my shots."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Geospin may be slower than XT, and perhaps Lightening is the same."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I also wanted something un-glued but the ease of playing with the glued XT is too tempting so I will mess with that spedglue bottle again
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Thanks Yuzuki,"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I have applied PO on the my old XT and Hur3 so I don't trust them to give actual playing characteristics compared to new sheets.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Besides both of them are quite old already.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,1-1.5 years old.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I used PO for experimenting with old rubbers but don't see myself using it permanently.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I did see improvement on speed for both rubbers.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Glad to hear that geospin tacky is similar to hur3 in tackiness.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,How about weight and hardness?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Thanks Gab,"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,When you said:
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,You mean the lightening is the same as geo or the xt?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I also have a bottle of speed glue left over, but decided to not use it... =)"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"O, yeah, when you said the red is less tacky than the black, how much less tacky would you say it is?"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Let's say in 1-10 scale with 0.5 increments...
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Also, do you notice the difference in weight between the red & black?"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Say extremely tacky may be 10, black XT is good tackiness, say 7 and red may be 4 or 5."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I did not use the 0.5 increment as even these numbers may be too subjective
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,A cut sheet of 2.2 mm XT is the same red/black for me 41g with some light glue build.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Only my old 2mm 6512 is lighter, 37-38g."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Speed-wise personally I cannot give you comparison as I do not own Lightening or Geospin to test, but as I heard players saying that both of these are a tad slower than the XT, I meant Geo and Lightening could roughly be the same."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,WOW!
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,That much difference?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I used black xt before and now looks like I'm not going even bother to think about the red one... Is the difference with the Red vs Black applies to all chinese rubbers?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"I mean, that much difference between red & black."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Or just with the XT?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,How about speedwise?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I suppose the same number but reverse?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,With red being faster?
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Generally speaking yes.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"The natural color of the rubber is black, but the dye that's used to make the rubber red reduces the tackiness ( therefore also increases speed a bit)."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,This is true for any tacky chinese rubber...
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I see...
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,So far: Geo Spin Tacky & H3 is similar and tackier than XT.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,No info on Lightening.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Seems like I'd try black XT with red gs tacky...
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,The only difference is that H3 is a little faster than Geospin Tacky IMO.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Regarding weights, we have a nice table drawn up by Silver: http://mass.doingitwrong.net/"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"Thanks Yuzuki,"
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,"The XT isn't onthe list, but the XP is."
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,I guess they are the similar...
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,Yes the XT and XP weight as very similar.
202,5f6c3784220a4650ffffddac,XT vs Geospin Tacky vs Lightening,the Lightening is also similar.
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,hrm
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,They're sort of at different ends
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,DSU is about 4 degrees softer.
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,"If Couga is Bryce speed (it's actually slightly faster), DSU is Sriver FX speed (though I think it's slightly slower; softer too)."
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,Couga doesn't spin well at all imo.
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,DSU is a high grip rubber.
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,"DSU is one of the most controlable rubbers I've come across.It is a bit slower than Couga,slightly softer.It has more pronounced curve in the air.Outstanding block,counter and smash performance.The lightest rubber so far."
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,"(38gr Couga-44gr) Since it's slower, it is a bit spinier on slower shots.On loop drives and fast loops I feel Couga is spinier, but in general they are in the same spin category.Both have very grippy tops.With spinmax they become rather tacky....and here's something off topic: I noticed that spinmax affects all my japanese rubbers and makes them kind a tacky, but this is not the case with my euro ones."
203,5f6c3787220a4650ffffddae,Juic Couga vs Juic Driva Smash Ultima,"(Nimbus,EGP, JOgold, JOsilver....so far)"
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,"I think it depends on how you hit it... For a slow loop the ball comes off faster from the JUIC with less effort, but once you start looping hard the ball comes off faster from the Globe..."
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,I was doing some kill vs low float practice - felt there was zero pace off the 999EN.
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,Could be an aftereffect of using Bryce for so long though.
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,And you feel there is more pace with the globe even coming from bryce?
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,"i have not tried globe or bryce, but my experience with nano is that it became markedly faster after the first week when the initial stickiness has worn off."
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,I'm pretty sure this is the case.
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,Actually I have a feeling now it's the clipper CR.
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,I thought these were supposed to be fast.
204,5f6c37a0220a4650ffffddbd,Juic 999EN vs Globe 999Nat,I could swear that my Septear is a good deal faster (I had both with 999EN on the FH tonight)
205,5f6c37d7220a4650ffffdddf,Rubber Weight (H3 vs H3 Blue Sponge),"Hard to be sure, since there tends to be quite a big variation of weights between different sheets of hurricane normal sponge."
205,5f6c37d7220a4650ffffdddf,Rubber Weight (H3 vs H3 Blue Sponge),"The blue ones do trend to be a little lighter on average, but I suspect it'snot likely to be lighter than a 1.8mm one."
205,5f6c37d7220a4650ffffdddf,Rubber Weight (H3 vs H3 Blue Sponge),I think I will order a sheet of H3 BS and see if its light enought for me
205,5f6c37d7220a4650ffffdddf,Rubber Weight (H3 vs H3 Blue Sponge),"Should work well with my Donic Power boost, or?"
205,5f6c37d7220a4650ffffdddf,Rubber Weight (H3 vs H3 Blue Sponge),"I have not tried the Donic Power boost, but a Falco booster worked well with my Glob 999 Nat, which has also quite a firm sponge."
206,5f6c37e5220a4650ffffdde8,H3 Blue Sponge vs. H3 provincial,"hi xeno,"
206,5f6c37e5220a4650ffffdde8,H3 Blue Sponge vs. H3 provincial,"the sponge of the provincial is softer,more elastic,lighter and absorbs glue better the topsheet is less tacky"
207,5f6c3803220a4650ffffddfc,Donic Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V 30deg,I've tried Coppa Gold.
207,5f6c3803220a4650ffffddfc,Donic Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V 30deg,"It was okay, but I prefer fast Japanese rubbers to it."
207,5f6c3803220a4650ffffddfc,Donic Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V 30deg,It just couldn't generate as much spin as them.
207,5f6c3803220a4650ffffddfc,Donic Coppa JO Silver vs Mark V 30deg,"not tried the JO silver but heard very good reports about it,also not heard anything bad about it"
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Hi Vali,"
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"I am using LKT Pro XT at the moment, (I prefer tacky rubbers and maintain the tackiness with Spinmax) and it is very light compared to Globe999nat for example..."
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Using the LKT rubber and OX Neptune on a TSP Balsaplus blade, my full made up bat weight is just 133 grams which is very light as you can imagine..."
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I have not played with the Balsaplus blade yet so I cannot say if it is a good combination at the moment...
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I have played with the LKT rubber and it is a very soft sponge and very spinny and about as fast a Geospin tacky...very good control...mine is speed glued with Falco Unlimited
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Srivers sponge is a lot firmer and the top sheet is not tacky nor anywhere near as spinny...LKT Pro XT is a lot tackier than LKT Pro XPand the XT version has spin generated by 1/ mechanical grip in the soft sponge, and 2/ tackiness"
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I need it light for my girly shots...lol.
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"..not really, it's for my TT elbow, which was caused by using a bat that weighed 200 grams."
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,fosss
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Yes the LKT or the 729 Supersoft are very light, and both midly tack... the LKT XP least tacky, then LKT XT and then supersoft - the black is always tackier."
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,They would certainly be slower than sriver in the same thickness...
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I can't comment to much on sriver since I'm not a sriver fan at all.
208,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,Thank you guys !
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Massive response...
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,This Spinsonic isn't bad actually takes a bit of getting use to ... what I've found with the super priming is that once long life speed glue effect wears off (it lasts ages) there's a large decrease in performance (and I speed glued this thing to bits)
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I was waiting for the Skyline follows up
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Spintech is either a loopers rubber and I think that is what is was designed for or....
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,a great choppers - which is what it was not designed for.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Basically its very easy to produce a float with this rubber with little variation in stroke and because the sponge is very soft its highly controllable.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Anyway thats not how I play so I'll be checking out Skyline in detail.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Testing in progress ...
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Spintech plays too much like a Euro loopers rubber for my tastes, but it woud be ok for a backhand rubber (but of course that is reserved for pips!)"
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Anyway keen on keep checking out Skyline - nice power - great power but we'll see how it runs.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Delicate serves bit tricky!
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"If I was to use it I'd need a game plan around it, which in this case isn't too hard."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,For my game Spintech is too slow and I don't like 'looper style' rubber.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,The tacky rubbers like skyline are awesome for spinny serves... the main reason I use them!
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Yeah you could be right it might produce a strange kind of spin - it could simply be the speed.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I can't see it being spinnier than Geospin T.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,What I noticed was the power Skyline produced* and how different it was from Geospin T. on knock about.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,My opponent commented that the spin was weird ... but it'll take several weeks before testing is finished.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I dunno.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"* I don't know a great deal about inverted (compared to long pips) I've played Bryce FX, Almana Sound, BTY TTS, BTY T Chop and I think thats about all."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Nice.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Quad post
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Heh heh fixed...
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Geospin T is actually not that tacky, but it IS great for generating spin."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Skyline 2.0mm super primed with long life glue.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Very different from the strong mechanical spin rubbers I am use to.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Fast and spinny but too powerful for my backhand loop against topspin.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I had to punch block this as opposed to loop it.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I could easily get use to this but I think for the time being I'll be sticking with the 1.5mm Skyline version uintil I get use the shift in rubber.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,The things I notice with it are:
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,1.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Feels fast compared to mechnical spin of Geospin T., Almana Sound and Bryce FX (however I played the last two rubbers on an ALL+ blade this was tested on an OFF blade)."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Has the extra gear for sure.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,2.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Strong brush stroke spin
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,3.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Medium throwing angle after priming
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,4 Post priming it was very stable across the blade.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,5.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Badly affected by dust - if a rubber good at mechanical spin gets dusty it still spins - with this rubber it drops off the blade
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,6.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Great forehand but will take some adjusting to play on the backhand
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,In depth knowledge of inverted is not my thing so I'll leave it there.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,The things I noticed about the 1.5mm:
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Strong spin, badly affected by dust, etc.."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,1.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,High throwing angle - not much different from Geospin T. This could be that I applied as much glue to the priming as 2.0mm (heaps)
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,2.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Stable and not as fast be a long way (obviously)
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,3.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Ok on the backhand
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Alls well that ends well and I like it.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Thanks for the update Mathias, and welcome back!!"
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,!
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I was under the impression that Spinsonic SV had a tacky surface on it.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Is that not correct?
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Spintech claims that it has both Tacky, and Mechanically spinny topsheet."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,It does - it uses a soft sponge so the ball digs into the rubber to allow mechanical spin.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,However the sponge is too soft IMO - the ball digs in too quickly and results in a slower speed.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,You need much thicker sponge than I was using.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I did speed glue it but haven't checked the results.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"See, I'm actually quite good with the sponge being soft."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Speed I don't need.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,What I need is high control in a rubber that is able to manipulate discusting amounts of spin on the ball.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Is there any inbuilt speed glue effect to this rubber?
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,How durable is it?
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,From Spintech's site it was really expensive.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Is there somewhere that this rubber isn't just ridiculously expensive?
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Ok generally I'm quiting forum posting for other reasons (pips forum) but anyway:
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Yes this rubber is superb at manipulating spin - for example producing a float (no spin) return from e.g.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,heavy topspin is easy with this rubber and yes it gives loads of control.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Normally producing a float with Chinese inverted is hard to perform and in particular control from incoming topspin.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"The rubber is officially a 'speed glue rubber', I just found the sponge very soft."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Precisely how it performs once primed I dunno - although I've had one primed for ages.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,The reason I didn't like it was because if you are off the table its hard to win a point using a power attack.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"However if I was a double inverted player I would certainly use a sheet of rubber of this nature on my backhand, which I could then twiddle with."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Basically if you've pips on one side and this on the other there just isn't any power in the game.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,As for price I'm afraid thats as cheap as it gets.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,My wife just chnages to Skyline II 1.5mm... she was very impressed witht he control it offered....her whole game imporved a notch overnight
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,being alex bumped this post up i'll say my 2 cents
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,spinsonic SV is perfect
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"yes I know, its caus i use it but its true, many people can see a huge change in my game thanks to the spinsonic, the amount of spin i generate is grea, my sidespin is lethal now."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"And now thnaks to a learning of diferent serves, I am starting to become a bit of a tricky player to play."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"The weight of spinsonic is great, even with pips on the back my blade is very light (mind you, spintech is know for weight, their Jade SV is one of the fastest and lightest bubbers around imo)."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"because of the weight, it makes the 3rd ball easier to pick up."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Control is amazing, i can pull off a lot of drop shots now because of teh rubber"
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Yeah I like Skyline 2 1.5mm (in fact I've just received another sheet today) but a low throw on the backhand is a pain (twiddle), although it provides much closer stroke angle to the pips, which is important."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Skyline 2 is great on the forehand and brilliant for sidespin loops because they stay low and spinny, without over arcing (easier to place and faster)."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,As I understand things Haggisv - unless I misunderstood - she understands pips.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I would read this as meaning your wife is better than you.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,So presumably she now much better than you?
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,You must have a great defensive forehand.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"A classic style of play if you win with speed, very classic."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Sounds to me like priming is a bad idea for the Spinsonic.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,That's just going to further soften an already soft sponge.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Possibly just EEII, or CTE, and slap that puppy on the blade."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"yea, thats why it suited me, vbecause I have an effective defenceive block that works, when i blokc the anmount of spin it sends back is a good amount."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,I just stuck the sucker on teh blade and played.
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,although i would liek to see how the rubber would play with EEII or CTE
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Well, if I run into alot of money someday I'll get it and let you know what it's like with EEII."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,"Uhmm., bbut but..arghh... maybe...    We're normally about 50/50 against each other, so the new rubber could change this    Against each other it's pretty even which is great for me... but against others in comp I'm well ahead... (hope she doesn't read this  )..."
209,5f6c3813220a4650ffffde04,Spintech Spinsonic vs. Skyline2,Thank you for pointing this out
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,IMO Desto F2 is better in any aspect (excepting his fragility).
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,But that depends on your style.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Desto is a soft tensor and Quattro is more like Sriver but a thicker topsheet.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"I should receive a sheet of quattro soon but according what I've red on various forums there is so many types of quattro (thickness, hardness, colour, ...retailer...  )there should be 1 looking like somehow to F2."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"All of the Donic F1, F2, and F3 are fragile, they crumble around the sides, but they all have a great feel when playing."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Played yesterday with quattro 2.2 1 side and F1 2.0 other side on acoustic.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Quattro was way slower than F1.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"Maybe my ""normal gluing"" was wrong."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,I then put 2 layers of speed glue in order to break'in.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Was much better but still nothing like a desto serie.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,I've red quattro needs few gluing before it can deliver it's full potential.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Is that true ?
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,How could I optimize the rubber w/o speedgluing ?
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,New formula (2006) are less fragile than formers.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,I got 2 sheets of F1 new formula that I play with for 3 mths and they do not crumble...hurray!
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Thanks for feedback jolan!
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"I have heard it takes a few session to break in, the effect gets better..."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"The Quattro topsheet is a lot thicker and firmer than the quattro, so I would think the feel would be quite differerent..."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Did you feel much speed glue effect?
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,That is good to know too... makes them better value!
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"Well, can't say yet."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Wouldn't be honest as I've been playing only once with it.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Let's wait saturday for a new session.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"What I did is that I removed the sheet, put 2 more layers of speed glue, get it rest, plus 1 layer of normal glue."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Sticked it on my legout and made test in my garage.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"Wow, nothing likes yesterday !"
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,It is alive !
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"fast, bouncy and crispy."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Is it speedglue or has it broken in ?
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,To be continued...
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"Adding some glue is often simiular to breaking it in, so I suspect the effect will be a little of both... No doubt it won't be quite as lively without glue though, so don't get your hopes up too high"
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,I have gone through several sheets of new Formula F1 since they came out with it.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,It most definitely crumbles around the edges but a little less than the original version.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"The new version plays well, but I preferred the original F1 Desto a little bit in terms of the overall ""speed glue"" like effect."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Overall it is a great rubber.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,I have a sheet of Desto F2 and is remarcably soft but very bouncy and speedy.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Great spin and nice medium-low throw.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"Indeed the topsheet is fragile ,if you accidentally hit the table(like me  ) it is possible to damage the topsheet ( with Globe 999 it is possible to damage the table ...)."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,However even the Donic said speed-glueing is not recommanded I had no problems using Tibhar Rapid Clean .
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"LOL, I like that!!"
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,!
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,That's true .
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Once accidentally I hit the table and take off the white paint from it.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,The rubber was OK.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Definetely the Globe 999 National is a great and durable rubber.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"Well, I had my second session with IQ."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Very different from the 1st.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Still a bit dissatisfaying.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Speed is here at last but surprinsingly hard to control.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"On current shots (drives, blocks) it's still on the slow side."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Let's imagine sriver fx with 1 thin layer of speed glue.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Then you start looping and wow here comes Mambo with 2 big layers of SG.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Spin is still missing.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Weight is low for a 2.2 thick sheet.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,"In brief and in order to stick to the topic, it has nothing to with desto F2."
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,I'll keep testing it for a while cause I suspect it to be a new evolutive generation of rubber.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,It grows and changes every time you play it until it reaches its adult form.
210,5f6c381d220a4650ffffde0b,Desto F2 vs Inspirit Quattro,Just feed it with glue and dress it with diff blades untill it finds its match...
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),Nice review lildudejds!
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),10 X as loud sounds impressive...although I really prefer tacky rubbers I'm getting tempted now....
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),"i have used desto f1,f2,f3 and super sonic as well as sf40."
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),"out of the whole lot, the two that are most versatile would be the f2 and f3."
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),it is true that f3 give a very loud pop (unglued-mated to a hard blade).
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),very nice spring and true euro like rubber!
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),huge mechanical spin.
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),does not last too long as they are quite brittle.
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),can be an alternative to the glue ban but is expensive to replace that often.
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),"10x may be a slight exaggeration, but the point i was getting to was that it is SUPER LOUD."
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),It is louder than any rubber ive ever used(and speed glued) and just as loud as any rubber ive ever heard anybody using.
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),It just makes you feel good when you hear it!
211,5f6c3851220a4650ffffde2c,Desto f3 bigslam VS. Glued Refoma(3 nice layers),Heh heh... yes I know what you mean...

1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,You'll find it hard to find reviews on a very new rubber.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"edit: except here http://ooakforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=32404   Maybe if money isn't an issue, trust the the manufacturer has made some improvements and you would be using the latest and greatest.Sponge hardness could be a consideration also so maybe if you like a particular hardness then have a look at what they all are."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,43 is probably rated medium so a safe enough bet.

1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I watched that same video with the English translation and subtitles as well as googled reviews of them all.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I guess I'll just have to try my luck and see if I like it the newest version.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Purchased joola rhyzer 43 in black/Max thickness.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I'll give you an update on what i think of it when it comes if you're interested.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"Yes, for sure"
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,So i finally got to play with my rhyzer 43 today at a local table tennis club.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I can only say positive things about it so far due to 1.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I only played with it for 3 hours2.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I don't get to play/practice often so faults in my game/technique I don't want to blame it on the rubber3.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I have only ever owned 1 high end rubber before being butterfly tenergy 05 as my comparsionI wanted to have a video of me playing with it but my wife didn't want to stay at the tt club and wanted to grocery shop/errands & i don't think these old guys at the tt club would want to hold my phone and record me instead of playing.So two things that I feel stands out with this rubber.Its fast & loud.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,If you have good technique / foot work it is really fun to play with.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,My opponents were overpowered in topspin rallies or the ball came back to fast for them to respond against my loops & drives.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"I want to say more about this rubber but I don't want to misrepresent it because I rarely play/know all the techniques/technical aspects of the game and how a rubber should perform close,mid,far from table with the correct technique."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Lets just say I had fun with it from all distances especially mid distance.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Plus of going to a tt club is I got to try other players equipment as well as let them try mine.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,So I got to compare rhyzer 43 first hand specifically to tenergy 05 and joola rhyzm -P (both in max thickness that were both fairly new).
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,To my eyes the rhyzer had more spin with harder/medium strokes and a more linear arc (but still safe arc to go over the net consistently) compared to the 05 & rhyzm -P. Rhyzer 43 was faster than T05 & J-P and the rhyzer 43 is on a slow blade being joola chen defender compared to the butterfly zlc blade & the other one was hinoki wood composition but i forget what it was.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I liked this rubber alot so I ordered another 2 rhyzer 43 red+black in max thickness & ordered another chen defender blade.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Our tt club is a seller/distributor of joola & butterfly products so he gets discounts from the manufacturer (mostly just discounts from joola).
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Those are my honest thoughts about this rubber.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I hope to make a video of it to let the rubber speak for its self but I probably wont go back to the tt club until i have to pick up my order due to work and becoming a first time expecting father in just a couple of weeks.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,The other rubber i used on my blade was a cheap friendship 729 soft fx.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Would prefer rhyzer 43 on both sides.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"Having just wasted £40 on a sheet of red Rhyzer 43 2.0mm I have say that as a result of the very thin top sheet and high catapult sponge this is a rubber you will love or hate depending on your playing style.If you stand back from the table and topspin or fast block everything with good modern short stroke technique it is great, but for a close to the table push,block hit type game not so great."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,The biggest problem to me is the total lack of feel and precision due to the very thin and soft top sheet and the high catapult from the fast medium soft sponge coming into play much earlier than say on the latest Tibhar Evolution or Aurus series Rubbers.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,In order of hardness:Rhyzm > Rhyzm - P > Rhyzer 43Glue effect:Rhyzer 43 > Rhyzm - P > Rhyzm.Oldest to newest:Rhyzm > Rhyzm - P > Rhyzer 43In my opinion Rhyzm require very sound technique (USATT 2000+) to get the most out of it.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"But, if you hit the ball cleanly you get a very strong ball."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Most people would have a hard time using it on the backhand.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,After a few months I am actually getting on quite well with Rhyzer 43 2mm red for the following reasons1.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,The high initial catapult has reduced a bit and the top sheet and sponge feel a bit firmer probably due to the factory booster wearing off.2.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,I have switched it to the slower back hand side of my Black & White blade but still plenty fast for aggressive close to table forehand play.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"The extra dwell of the slow side makes easier to spin up the ball and gives more control on blocks, whilst the fast sponge still gives lots of speed when needed.3."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Much improved technique.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,It took four weeks hitting ball everywhere but I now have a more compact swing with proper rotation.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,As often mentionsed these fast tensors reallly show up poor technique.Just bought a sheet of Andro R42 2mm for my harder Bloodhound blade.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Will be an interesting comparison.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"12 months on and having settled on Rasanter R42 as my FH rubber, I stuck my old sheet of Rhyzer R43 onto my Dr Neubauer Bloodhound blade."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Being a hard and low throw blade designed primarily for blocking with pips out rubbers finding a rubber that will enable close to the table spinney loops is quite difficult.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,"The Rhyzer R43 was in fact remarkably effective having shrunk 2-3mm and lost most of its initial factory extreme tension, still fast and spinny but more controlled with a firmer much less bouncy feel."
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,Most important of all it for the first time made topspins close to the table with the Bloodhound easy to do.
1,5f6c21df035f29fdaf67ffa3,Joola rhyzer 43 an improvement or worth buying? Help me pick,So I clearly need to find something that out of the packet plays close to how my old R43 sheet now does.
2,5f6c21e6035f29fdaf67ffa7,Are Tenergy/Dignics rubbers really the best?,Well they are certainly not inferior products.

2,5f6c21e6035f29fdaf67ffa7,Are Tenergy/Dignics rubbers really the best?,"That being said, I can convince myself that there are other rubbers which generate more rebound or more spin than Tenergy 05 on less than perfect strokes.Feel on the other hand is more subtle."
2,5f6c21e6035f29fdaf67ffa7,Are Tenergy/Dignics rubbers really the best?,"If you look at the older OOAK resources of topsheet/sponge hardness measurements, you can approximate the same feel with many different rubber types."
2,5f6c21e6035f29fdaf67ffa7,Are Tenergy/Dignics rubbers really the best?,"Again, that being said, rubber manufacturing is not very precise (tenergy included), so one sheets might feel different than another of the same model...Take what you need to help you move on."

2,5f6c21e6035f29fdaf67ffa7,Are Tenergy/Dignics rubbers really the best?,"OK, so maybe it produces a little more spin than what I was using before (what WAS it?"

2,5f6c21e6035f29fdaf67ffa7,Are Tenergy/Dignics rubbers really the best?,"I like that T05 pushes over the table are flat and spinny and gives you a decent serve return that sometimes causes opponent to net if you push fast enough,bear in mind this is one of the highest/arcing throw rubbers so the best of both worlds,even on my thin flex def blade,+longer lasting than most factory boosted rubbers so the extra cost evens out somewhat in the long runI also tried Dignics 05 and for me was inferior to T05 on all shots,serve return in particular where the ball was way too high and I couldn't find a way with it,maybe I'm too used to the t05 where everything seems to work on autopilot for me."

4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,MX-S is a hard low-throw rubber similar to the best Chinese ones.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,IMO it is designed for close to the table game.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Really?
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Similar to Chinese rubber?
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Hmmm...Iskandar
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"I used to play with MX-S 1.9-2.0 mm on my FH before I started trying out hybrid rubbers.MX-S has the hardest sponge among the Evolution series (and thus is the heaviest one, I believe)."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"Due to that, it isn't as springy as MX-P and feels a bit closer to the hybrid rubbers - although the throw is still higher than theirs."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"I feel that it allows for a little bit more spin that MX-P - but again, less than tacky rubbers do."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,You might have to adjust your FH loop a little if coming from a springy tensor rubber.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"Both over the table and middle distance play is good, in my opinion, I didn't feel any lack of power.I think it could work as a BH rubber, too, if you like the harder feeling."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"Monster Spin - is the first thing that comes to mind, when I think of MX-S...A pretty demanding rubbers, in terms of footwork, action, technique... etc... Not for players, who stretch for a shot (like myself)... Good at lifting back-spin..."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"I like the way it blocks, but once again, not if you stretch for the ball..."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Your footwork needs to be good.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,I agree with the above - definitely more demanding than MX-P.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"Feels hard and requires almost ideal angle of the racket on the ball contact - otherwise you will hit out or net.I tried to use it for a while on FH and BH interchangeably but gave up and went back to MX-P, because I was just losing a bit of control."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,I didn't want to spend more time on adjustments.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,For someone who always played Europeans style rubbers MX-S may be challenging.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"After playing KTL Rapid Speed (my first rubber and long-time favourite, now it feels hard and lifeless like brick) and Yasaka Rising Dragon on the same blades Tibhar Evolution MX-S does not feel hard like old-style Chinese.MX-S sponge is medium hardness."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,At least 1.8 version clicks like soft tensor during flat hits.Slow loops are difficult with MX-S hardness but wristy slaps are effective and spiny.So I think it is possible to play MX-S on BH if BH is your strong wing.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,MX-S is not forgiving rubber to cover weak side.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,How is chopping with MX-S?
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,?
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,MX-S is a fast offensive rubber.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Chopping is spiny and easier then with other modern catapult rubbers but you need a solid technique to tame its speed even with minimal sponge thickness.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"To know if MX-S is right for you, you would of course need to use it a spell.In general, it is good to know the type of rubber and the hardness of sponge you prefer for your FH."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"That would save you a lot of trouble right away, but we are curious cats.Unless you have a fast bat and the stroke to get the ball into the rubber and sponge, you will not get everything you could get out of MX-S."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"If you have the hard hitting stroke, sure, it could be for you.I have over time discovered that soft sponged modern dynamic rubbers are my sweet spot on FH, a few rubber up to medium sponge."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"That is just me, you should discover your own sweet spots.I goof off and chop a lot at the club, although I am an attacking player with some all-round tendencies.Unless you are facing monster-man massive loops from really hard hitting advanced players (that would require a softer sponged slower inverted rubber), you can adjust and chop with the inverted rubber you like for offense with high consistency... and given the time, high quality."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,I can chop well even with a med firm sponged MX-K in Max sponge.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"It is a matter of timing to ball in the right part of zone right height impact, shorter stroke and control of grip and acceleration."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Speaking of MX-K... What's THAT like?
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Iskandar
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"Extreme short description.Overall, a faster rubber with control and high possible spin.Low to medium impacts - totally linear (like Karis) - you get out exactly what you put in."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Ditto with spin based on your stroke - you get what you did - no less and no more.Strong impacts - this rubber is a totally different animal.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Extreme spin on brush with fast bat.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Extreme spin and extreme speed with a bang impact forward stroke.Slow heavy spin easy to do and bounces high if you landed it deep.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Powerloop will fall off a cliff late and not bounce up.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Both are very troubling to cope with.Topsheet very grippy.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Also excellent soft defensive stroke results.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"Soft topspin touch defense (think lobbers, retrievers, allrounder) easy to do with light wrist and short stroke.Ball does not rebound all crazy (only rebounds by what you did - zero additional) on the low/medium impacts, so chopping is easier to do than one would expect of an OFF rubber."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,Thanks Der_Echte!
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,It sounds a little like Tibhar Hybrid K1.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"I used MX-S on backhand for two blades, one is timo boll spirit, and one is innerforce layer zlc.I've always like a boosted h3 neo (soft) on bh, 37-38 degree, problem is i dont like the reboosting process ,costly and the rubber dont last that long especially after second reboost, even the tackiness is affected by then which hinders me from sticking to it.mxs somewhat let me relive that h3 neo bh era for a while after using t05 for a some time now.like h3 neo, u better know how to use ur wrist on this rubber, to me rely alot on surface of rubber to produce the spin vs hitting through it, especially when taking serves, and third ball attack.mx-s suites the zlc more than alc blades imo."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"If not for having the awesome t05 , mxs would be next best thing to me, seems like a durable rubber, even more than t05"
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"I'm on my second sheet of MX-S and have no issues using it from mid to far distance for looping, fishing, and *some* chopping."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"It's very spinny and has decent top end speed, but it's not super bouncy."
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,I find this makes it easier to control closer to the table.
4,5f6c221d035f29fdaf67ffc2,Opinions about Tibhar MX-S for FH or BH,"I especially like it for service reception!Smashing and driving are not strong points for this rubber, but then again, those are not strong points for me either, so it could be a technique issue on my part."
5,5f6c26766d99ef02106d724f,Loop/Counterloop rubber for FH; need help,So the issue is that long distance loops requires a lot of effort?

5,5f6c26766d99ef02106d724f,Loop/Counterloop rubber for FH; need help,"not 1.5mm, but 1.8 or 2.0mm) for looping would be for use with balsa blades (specifically, Re-Impact blades) - apparently the blade surface behaves a little like sponge and a thinner sponge works better."
5,5f6c26766d99ef02106d724f,Loop/Counterloop rubber for FH; need help,I don't remember why the heavier sponge was worse in this case.. probably control issues.

6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,"Although I must say no, haven't tried but am interested in short pip defence especially after hou Ying Chao recent success using sp."
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,Spectol I believe.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,Must say I've an old nittaku blade (combi) quite fast I've got a rev on the carbon side and 802 in 1.5mm on other side.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,I really like quality of this make.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,Japanese I believe.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,I'm sure the moristo.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,Would be a good choice.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,"I think that , for def a 1.4 would be good."
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,More attacking possibilities then thicker.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,The sp is harder to chop I think than LP rubbers.. reacts more to spin of course.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,"But my thoughts are that in the modern defensive game, although still very valid, it's the more aggressive defensive players that seem to do better."
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,I hope someone picks up to give some feedback on moristo.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,Cheers.
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,I cannot say anything about Moristo SP as my experience with SPs has been short and not as successful as with inverted .
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,"I don't really like SPs much.My post is on Moristo DEF, the inverted rubber.For me it has been a great discovery.At present I am playing in 1.2 mm and I can defend and attack consistently.Plenty of spin on serves when needed, great control in chops and blocks.With Grubba all + I have enough speed to attack with quality and safely.Of course, my set up is not a rocket but the control with good speed is there ."
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,"Also , when I twiddle on the bh the control makes all the shots safe and with great placement.The only drawback is the price, yes, ...not cheap.That's why in my free time I try to find a cheap replacement ,however, I like it so much I doubt i will change it during this season .If any players do like soft thin sponges on the fh plus spin plus good control in chops and blocks, Moristo Def will not let you down ."
6,5f6c26796d99ef02106d7251,Nittaku Moristo DEF 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.8,It is a safe bet
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I have played with Palio 1997 only briefly, and although I have a sheet of Bloom Power, it is still in the packet."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Sorry this won't be a direct answer.But in your situation, I would buy H3 Provincial, which is a very predictable rubber in my experience."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Noticeably better than the standard H3 and a reasonable price.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"You could also look at 729 Battle 2, which is tacky and works well with softer blades."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I suspect that the Bloom series are similar.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Loki GTX Pro is my current personal choice though for an H3 alternative.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Would you please let us know wha tis your usual cleaning routine.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I am personally interested in it cause I play STN too and simply would like to know what to expect from this rubber.I haven't used hurricane 8 myself, but I regularly play against two people who use H8."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"One guy uses soft version the other hard, H40."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"So, from what I can tell 40 degrees is a way harder than STN, so will really need to adjust."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I dont think that tackiness of H8 lasts longer than STN.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,They both complained that after 2 months it is reasonable to replace H8.I cannot give you a hint which exact rubber to use as a replacement.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,But on your FEXTRA blade DHS H39/H38 degrees will feel somewhat similar to STN.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"On 729 scale H47 will feel harder than STN, so H45 is probably closer."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"From my personal experience the durability of tackiness on these rubbers is very similar: Hurricane III commercial H39, STN, 729 08 ES H47/H45 However sponges of these rubbers are so much different."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thank you for the recon recommendation.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Hurricane 3 provincial comes with yellow and blue sponge.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,What is the difference between them?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The blue sponge version is much more expensive.My usual cleaning routine is to wipe off the rubber with a wet sponge and put a non-sticky plastic sheet on it.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"If you say the level of tack is the same for Hurricane 3 compared to STN, that would mean it shouldn't make a difference at least from that perspective."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The sponges may be different but that wasn't my primary complaint about the STN so it may or may not matter for me to go with a different rubber.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,That leaves me in a dilemma whether I should even change it at this time.Too many decisions..
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thanks!
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Hi Learnin,Have you ever considered trying Gambler Burst again?"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I have it on Thor's Hammer on 2 blades.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,1 sheet is 3 months old playing 5+ hours a week and the other is 3 weeks old.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Both will hold a ball for at least 6 seconds upside down.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I like them much more than I liked the ""old school"" Chinese rubbers, as well as H3 neo."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"TheKLeifheit13, Thank you for chiming in with that recommendation."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,It is funny you should mention it but I have been looking at Gambler Burst Thor's Hammer as well.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I have played with the Burst GearZ in the past, which has a too soft sponge for my liking, but not with Thor's Hammer."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,It was OOS for a while but seems to be back in stock again.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,How would you rate the hardness of the Thor's Hammer sponge in DHS degrees?Thanks!
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I do pretty much the same, but in addition, in the end of the week I use droplet of liquid soap and water to get rid of sweat."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Once dried, ball will then stick for long time."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,No magic really.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,And I agree there is no point in changing rubber brand if you are only after better tackiness.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,But ...On the other hand why do we need tackiness?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,People tend to think that it helps to spin the ball.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Yes sure it does, so why not all rubbers are made tacky!?"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Jap style rubbers, for example Palio AK47 red or blue, would spin your ball not less than tacky STN, but these are just ""grippy"" top sheets and not sticky at all.Sure you know it better than me that tackiness in Chinese classic rubbers is to compensate for the otherwise short dwell time because of hard sponge."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Did you notice that if top sheet is not tacky then it will not have hard sponge.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"And opposite, if there is hard sponge then topsheet is made tacky to win back some dwell time."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"So what I am trying to say here that when we choose to go for tacky Chinese rubbers we normally want to get that hard sponge on the racket, tackiness comes as extra little bonus."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Our playing style then different - full body rotation, power from your hips and etc (ask boxer does he hit using hand power or hips and torso power?"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,You might be very surprised ...) Similar mechanics here.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,If we want to use Chinese classic sponge we do full swing shots to bend that hard sponge and make it work.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Tiny wrist/elbow motions are not powerful enough to do that.So 1) if you are not doing any of that or not purposely learning towards these skills and 2) putting Chinese rubbers on your blade because of tackiness cause it helps to spin the ball, take it easy and go for soft sponge but grippy topsheet."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Here is an example of such topsheet.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Black is zero tacky, while red is lightly tacky but they produce heavy spin even from backhand."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thank you for the tip about using a drop of soap with the water once a week.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I will try that and see.I am aware about the link between tack and the hard sponge although my understanding was that, with the Chinese technique, you don't try and engage the sponge fully but go for brush shots with the sponge providing some assistance but never fully compressed."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Of course that requires a near-perfect technique and adequate leg/upper body power which most people who are not in the CNT don't have.That being said, you do bring up a good point that maybe tack is overrated as the cause for spin if your technique is not correct.At this time, based on all the feedback, I've decided to stick with my STN and will try the Gambler Burst Thor's Hammer when I decide to change from it."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thanks!
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The blue sponge has magical properties.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,That's why the Chinese National Team doesn't use the orange sponge.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"By the way, try to find red sheets with blue sponge.. those are supposedly the most magical (maybe because they don't exist..).."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"If it's something that remains tacky that you're looking for, well I just came across this:viewtopic.php?f=44&t=35229&start=15#p367244https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Double- ... 76205.htmlIt, too, has magical blue sponge...  Iskandar"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,   You can always rely on Iskandar to bring some levity to the situation.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"From what I have read online, including on Coach EmRatThich's site (https://pingsunday.com/dhs-hurricane-3- ... rricane%27), the blue sponge is harder and faster."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The trick seems to be determining whether the one you buy is real or fake.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I was trying to get some feedback from those who may have used the versions to see if the ""difference"" is really that much or whether it only matters to the top players who are trying to get every last bit of performance from their equipment.Thanks!"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,And now try to convince me guys that H3 national which is designed for player with powerful pro technique is good for humble amateurs who is not putting on that much power.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"That national sponge must be hard as hell, H50?"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Not only that, apparently pros who use it also boost the heck out of it."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The REALLY high prices are for sheets that were purportedly made for some Chinese National Team player or another.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,These often come in generic/plain packaging because if you're makiing 20-30 sheets for some pro there's no need to put it in retail packaging.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,You just hand them a stack of sheets in a box.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"People will pay astronomical prices for these, hence all the fakes."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"The ""National Team"" rubbers in the white packets you find on legitimate vendor sites like Eacheng are just DHS's attempt to cash in on this."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Who knows what that stuff really is and who among the pros actually uses it.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Why do some of these come with orange sponge?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Because some of them are red sheets.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,You can't put blue sponge behind a red H3 topsheet (though it might work for more opaque ones like Ckylin or AK47) - the rubber turns purple.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Who knows if this orange sponge is equivalent to the blue?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Iskandar

7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"The package picture doesn't say anything about it being ""provincial"" version so I don't even know if this is the regular one being sold with a markup.Thanks!"

7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Yeah, the blue sponge (""#22"") is the ""good"" stuff, and you only find it on Provincial and National grade black sheets."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"You NEVER find it on ANY red sheets, and never on retail grade sheets."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Whether it's all that much better than the orange stuff, I have my doubts - the fact that you can buy Provincial and National sheets with orange sponge (""#20"") tells me the orange sponge can't be that inferior (though it might be subtly different)."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"The blue sponge sheets here cost $10 extra ($40 instead of $30) and I'll betcha it's a gimmick - since you ONLY find the blue sponge on National and Provincial sheets, it's GOT to be better, therefore people will pay more for it."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Maybe it is better, I mean, so many people can't be wrong (  ) but here's a challenge - buy two sheets, both black, same sponge thickness and hardness, mount them on the same blade, and tell us if you (or your club mates) can tell the difference (cover up the sponge with wide edge tape if necessary)."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"The ""white label"" National sheets are here:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DHS-Ori ... 34108.html""Ma Long"" version..  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DHS-Hur ... 72128.htmlThis really isn't that expensive ($85 for the Ma Long version)."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I don't think it's actually made for Ma Long - why would Ma Long need the anti-fake hologram?

7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Fake?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Although i am using H3 with blue sponge National, this was initially just for experimenting."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I have not done a direct comparison between national sheets with orange sheets.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"However, i have tried provincial with both, and did not find the difference to be that great."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"So, save the money."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Incidentally, Ma long uses 42 degrees, most of us shouldn't."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"To be frank, i find that the Loki GTX pro allows me to reach similar sorts of level of play as the H3 National BS, but I am not an elite player by any stretch.To clean rubbers, I use a couple of drops of olive oil, which are spread all over and then wiped off immediately with a lint free cloth."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Works a treat.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I do this immediately after playing and then attach protection sheets, which will stick quite nicely to tacky rubber."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Water and hand also works, but i am allergic to probably latex in the rubber, and rubbing my palm across the rubber irritates my hand badly.PS."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"The absolute tackiest rubber I have used is Three Sword Leap, white packet and cheap."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,It feels very hard and requires a lot of effort.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"So I have no idea what degree sponge was on the H3n I had, but I haven't been able to hit through the Thor's Hammer sponge yet and I can swing pretty hard."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I'm actually downgrading to the stock blue diamond sponge to try and find a sponge I can activate that's still hard enough to stand up to my normal loops.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I do have to say that the Thor's sponge has a lot of power available, though."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I agree that the gearz sponge is too soft so hopefully the normal sponge is the Goldilocks of the 3.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"If you haven't already purchased it, I would advise you to call up Zeropong and speak to them."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I spoke to Tom (owner) when I called up a few months back and he told me that the GearZ sponge was their mid-hard offering.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I do not know how the Blue Diamond sponge compares in terms of hardness but he indicated that they may be phasing it out in the near future.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I do not see it available in Blue Diamond sponge on their website and I do not know if that is the default sponge.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"However, they should be able to guide you if you call them up."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"As an aside, I took a look at the Burst rubber on my backup paddle and it is definitely more tacky than the newer STN on my primary paddle."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I will definitely be buying the Burst Thor's Hammer to replace my STN.Thanks!
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The rubber or Igor?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Igor's real.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Probably.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,There used to be all sorts of guides to tell you how to tell real from fake National H3.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I remember one tip - if it actually says ""National Version"" (in Chinese) on the back then it's fake."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Made sense back when ""National Version"" meant personal rubber, probably not so much any more, with DHS selling their own official ""National versions"" with holograms."

7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Iskandar[/quote]All good guys, it is useful info anyway."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"If Ma Long uses H42 then whoever told me Chinese pro use very hard rubbers up to 50 simply misinformed me or I misunderstood.Anyway, thanksP.S.Yesterday I did test of how long my STN holds the ball and got bored holding the racket for 20 sec."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,That was before the session.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"After 3.5 hours of play, I tried again and then it held for like 1 - 3 sec."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I don't know if it needs to be any better!
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"The blue diamond is the sponge on the ""basic"" Burst and Big Gun."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,It's between the Gearz sponge and Thor's Hammer.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,They sent me a matrix picture of all the rubber/sponge combinations and where they fall as far as speed and tackiness.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I think Burst is the right choice for you if you want tacky.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,By far it's my favorite topsheet I've used.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Probably worth remembering that DHS uses a different scale to most Euro/Japanese rubbers.And the picking up the ball and holding it upside down trick is a red herring really.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,The true test is in how much rotation you can get on the ball in real play.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thank you for the information about the various Gambler sponges and where they sit in relation to each other w.r.t hardness.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Could you let me know if the Gambler folks provided an approximate hardness for the different sponges and, if so, which hardness scale it is based on?"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Also, based on the information you provided, it appears I am the one that needs to call them up to determine which one to purchase  Please share your opinions about the performance of the Burst Blue Diamond in comparison to the Thor's Hammer."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thanks!
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,There's more than one scale in use.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"There's the Japanese scale, there's the ESN scale, there's the 729 scale, there's the DHS scale... 42 on the 729 scale would be a medium hard rubber, all those ""training sheets"" from various manufacturers are usually 42 on the 729 scale."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"42 on the DHS scale apparently means very hard - maybe 38 or 39 on the DHS scale is the same as 42 on the 729 scale while 42 would be equivalent to, say, 46."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,And all of these Chinese rubbers are supposedly harder than even 50 degrees on the ESN scale.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,It's funny - 729 uses the 729 scale with everything they sell EXCEPT for Battle II - the numbers used for that make me think it's the ESN scale.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Either that or it's ROCK HARD.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Who knows how any of these scales work, whether they're linear, how one goes about calibrating instruments, etc."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Iskandar
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Would you mind posting the matrix they sent you?
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I tried but the file was too big.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Not sure how to get around that
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"So you're right, blue diamond is the softest sponge they offer."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"It's not pathetically soft, though."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Gearz is barely palpably harder than BD.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thor's Hammer is significantly harder than BD and harder than Gearz by a seemingly larger margin than Gearz to BD.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I noticed I had less power with BD on balls-out shots but found I got more spin on everything.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Consistency was way better as well and I could attack a much larger percentage of serves and pushes effectively.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I also had to put in less effort for just about everything.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,So I guess it's a trade-off whether you want your >90% effort shots to be better or you want your over the table game to be better.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I think this is the matrix TheKLeifheit13 was referring to.http://gamblertt.com/images/rubberselectorchart2018.jpgI contacted Zeropong and they were kind enough to share this although I do not see quite a few rubber/sponge combinations in their catalog.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Perhaps they are planned in the future.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thank you for your feedback.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I guess that is why they are thinking of discontinuing BD.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"As I stated previously, from when I spoke to Tom last, he seemed to indicate that GearZ was the replacement for BD."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"That would make sense if the hardness was similar but the sponge was more ""active""."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"But as you noted, if consistency is better with BD, maybe it still has a place in their lineup.Thanks!LTT"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"I could see Gearz replacing Blue Diamond for rubbers intended to be high performance (Burst, Big Gun, etc.)"
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,because it's damn fast and still soft enough to feel the ball.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"But for Zero or rubbers intended to be easier to play, Blue Diamond makes sense."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"Gearz would keep most of the ease of play you get with BD, but add an extra 15% or more speed-wise."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,Thanks for the link to the chart.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I just switched from Burst Thor's Hammer to Zero Blue Diamond because I didn't realize the regular Burst had Blue Diamond Sponge  I wish the Zeropong website said that.
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,"If you're in the US, you can get a 2-pack of regular Burst from Amazon for $28.00 and free shipping."
7,5f6c26ac6d99ef02106d726a,Palio HK1997 gold or 729 Bloom Power,I like it on both sides in the regular Blue Diamond sponge.
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,"Sounds like you're after a rubber with a softer sponge, and probably a 'glue effect' rubber, which gives you the feel of the ball sinking in, and then catapulting out."
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,"Tenergy gives you that feel, but so do many German rubbers with medium hard sponges."
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,"Something like Donic Acuda S2 will be a lot cheaper than Tenergy and still gives you that feeling of dwell time, and it's a step faster than Mark V.Yes Rozena is as fast as Tenergy, and not quite the same feel as the Tenergy (just more speed but less spin), so that might not be the best option."
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,One of the most comfortable rubbers I've used recently is the Andro Hexer PowerGrip.
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,It has a great feeling for me.
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,Bluefire M2 was another that was quite nice to use and had a good dwelly feeling.
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,However depending on the blade your mileage may vary
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,I'd argue for something like Baracuda or Rakza 7 or Rasant Beat.
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,"You just want a Tensor with soft-ish sponge - there are dozens of them, and they'll all play more or less the same."
8,5f6c26bf6d99ef02106d7276,Rubber with similar dwell/hold time as Butterfly's Tenergy,"Shouldn't this be moved down to ""Inverted Rubbers""?"

10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"If you're still gearing in the strokes, still learning, then Zero would be a safe selection."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Have compared the two and, frankly, they show their family connection with middle-speed, good control, etc."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Think Hurricane 3 and Sriver but similar to each other.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Epictetus, Thank you for taking the time to respond."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"While I've been playing only 2 months now, I'm pretty good at looping (so I've been told by other players who are better than me ) and try to use the Chinese style."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I feel like the blade/sponge may be leading to bad habits due to the soft sponge and the carbon blade (even though it is rated as ALL).
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I agree with your assessment that since I'm a novice-intermediate player I may not be able to handle the hard sponge; that is the very concern I have.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The only issues that I have with the Zero are that the Zero is not tacky and there are no reviews of the Zero with Blue Diamond sponge.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"The Burst (w/o Thor's hammer) sponge is, unfortunately, not described on the Zeropong site so I don't know if it is mid hard or soft."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"My preference would be a mid-hard rubber so I'll have to ask for that information by calling up Zeropong customer service.Regarding the BH, do you think the Mech-Tek 2.1 mm would be a good choice?"
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I have a better backhand than forehand but still trying to become more consistent at looping.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"My loops, when they cross the net, are pretty good."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I don't know if my lack of consistency in looping is due to my technique or a limitation of the Sevens rubber.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"I also have a good flick that, more often than not, lands on the table and is hard to return."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Looking at the description of the Mech-Tek, it states that it is like Tenergy and my concern is that it may be detrimental rather than helpful at this stage."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,That is why i was looking at the Zero Blue Diamond as a possible replacement BH rubber.I will try to capture video of my play but don't have a tripod for my cell phone so it may not be possible at this time.Any suggestions you can provide will be very much appreciated.Thanks in advance!
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"I tried Sevens, Zero, and Mech-Tek on my backhandSponge hardnessSevens < Zero Blue sponge < Thor's HammerSpeed ( given my level)Sevens < Zero < Mech-TekBlue sponge softer than Thor''s Hammer sponge.Burst with Thor's Hammer sponge medium hard to hard."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Really depends on your swing speed.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,For me Burst/Thor's Hammer was unforgiving for my slow swing speed.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,A more advanced player thought Burst/Thor''s Hammer fine.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Mech-Tech is bouncier and spinner than either Zero or Sevens.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,More challenging to control if your technique unstable.I use a BBC All+ 5 ply blade.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"ckwsp101, Thank you for sharing your experience with these rubbers."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I was worried that Mech-Tek would be too much for me to handle at this stage of my TT journey and you seem to be confirming that.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Although I have a decent BH, I would by no means say it's extremely good and my fear is that using a very bouncy/spinny rubber would lead to a regression."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Could you let me know if you used the 2.1mm or 1.7 mm sponge and if that would make a difference?
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Also, I have been looking for reviews of the Zero with Blue Diamond sponge but have been unable to find them."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Could you share your opinions about this?Many thanks!
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I'm familiar with these rubbers.I've been playing with Burst thors hammer on my penhold forehand since January.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I like the sponge for the price point.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,It's not as tacky as you might imagine.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Good grip.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Just don't expect H3 or anything like that.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Sponge is solid.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"I think after about 6 months or so on it, it's softening up and I prefer the pop it had when firm."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Recommend boosting it.My buddy tried the Mech-Tek predator.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Spiny & softer.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Just not a lot of pop.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,That's a backhand rubber if I've ever seen one.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"learninTT,I tried Zero blue sponge in 2.1mm.I had no issues."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The topsheet had less tack compared to Sevens.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"ckwsp101, Apologies for not being clear with my question; I was asking if you used Mech-Tek in 1.7 or 2.1 mm when you said it was too bouncy and hard to control.Regarding Zero with Blue Diamond sponge, how did you find the overall experience as compared to the Sevens?"
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I've read that the Sevens sponge is too soft and feels dead.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I've also read that the Sevens has a lower throw causing a loop against backspin to go into the net.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"This is the only rubber that I've played with so I don't have a point of reference but I do find that if I don't whip my BH/FH, it goes into the net."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I've always attributed it to errors in my technique but now think that the rubber may have a part to play in it.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Could you provide your opinion on this?Thanks!
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Unfortunately it is due to technique... it does not matter what the throw of the rubber is, you just need to adjust for it, and the ball will go over the net."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"High throw rubbers can make it easier to get the ball over the net, but there's nothing you can't do with a lower throw rubber, it just requires some adjustment."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I tried Mech-Tek in 1.7mm It was fine for me at my playing level.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"With sound technique I can produce a strong opening loop against backspin ball with any of the mentioned Gambler products.Yes you need to make a ""minor"" adjustment for higher or lower throw rubber."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,That is not what I wanted to hear .
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"But seriously, thank you for letting me know that it is due to technique."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,My primary problem was on the BH and I thought this may be due to the lack of power on the BH vs FH and getting a rubber with higher throw would help.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I guess I'll have to work on improving my technique..The Mech-Tek in 1.7mm seems to be out of stock currently and the 2.1mm may be more difficult to control on my backhand so I guess I'll have to wait.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I'm still waiting for my Sanwei M8 blade to be delivered from aliexpress and I'm hoping that the 1.7mm would be back in stock by then.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I guess I'll have to play with it to find out how much of an adjustment is required.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I definitely agree with Haggis.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Getting a dialed-in backhand topspin drive can be a problem, I definitely had it a couple years ago."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Watching some videos (mainly Brett's) helped, but what REALLY helped was some coaching and time with a robot."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,It was a matter of racket angle and use of wrist that was the problem.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"The problem is definitely NOT the rubber (unless you're playing with long pips and trying to loop, or something like that..  ).Iskandar"
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Just giving in my input if you haven't made a choice yet.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Just FYI this is my personal experience.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I've played with Sevens and Mech-Tek 2.1mm.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I actually bought the Silver Dragon Double Carbon with Sevens rubber for my girlfriend as her first paddle.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I played with it for a couple months and it's actually a pretty good setup for beginners and even for intermediate.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"As it was mentioned, I did find the Sevens rubber to have a low throw angle."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Agreeing with others you have to make an adjustment when switching between rubbers/blades.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I have 4 setups that I can play with and I'm very comfortable switching among them.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The Sevens rubber had a good tackiness to it from new (6.5/10 I was able to hold the ball for about 2 seconds).
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,After a couple months of playing the tackiness is still good (6/10).
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,My current setup is a Xiom Hayabusa ZXi with Super 999T on FH and Mech-Tek Predator on BH.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I've tested my friend's Tenergy 80FX so in comparison with Mech-Tek it's similar but Tenergy is much more bouncy and faster.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I tried playing the Tenergy on my FH but I didn't like it at all.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"However, I wouldn't hesitate to play Mech-Tek on my FH, which to me felt a lot better."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,As for spin I can't comment on Tenergy but Mech-Tek gives plenty.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The throw angle on Mech-Tek doesn't seem to be high or low.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Just yesterday during a rally I was able to perform a fast backhand loop from under the table and go over the net with about 2-2.5 inches of clearance.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Really surprised me as I've never done that.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,There's much more to the rubber that I haven't seen.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"In addition, I was very surprised about the tackiness of Mech-Tek when I first got it (5/10)."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Although now after a couple of months it's lost it.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,And as it states they sure are grippy.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Staticshock10 - thank you for your input.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I called up and spoke to Tom from Zeropong and went with his recommendations (shown in my signature).
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I bought both of them with the GearZ sponge which is extremely good.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I do think I should have gone for the Mech-Tek for my BH instead of the X3 Diamond; I would have been able to handle it.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,It is not that the X3 Diamond is bad - far from it.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,But I feel that the Mech-Tek would have been better for me from a mid-court perspective.I'm still developing a more consistent BH but do not want to EJ since I feel that will impact my learning curve.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,It took me a while to get used to this new setup and would like to focus on refining my technique.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I will buy the Mech-Tek when it is time to change the current rubbers since my game should have progressed quite a bit by then.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The Burst is surprisingly good on the FH and I like it a lot.Thanks again to all for your advice and feedback.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,It will help me a lot in my TT journey.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Interesting finding:I recently tested out Mech-Tek on FH and Super 999T on BH.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Surprisingly, I like it a lot."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I personally think that Mech-Tek is better on the FH than on BH.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Loops were very crisp and beautiful.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"Smashes and ""plays away from the table"" are amazing."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Really gives you the confidence!
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Short game is very much acceptable.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I didn't find a problem with pushes.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Flicks are almost effortless.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Only downside is that I wish it retained it's tackiness better because serves aren't as spiny when new.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"And with this setup, I find my BH to have more control with a tackier rubber."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,Chiquita flicks (banana) feel a lot better than the Mech-Tek as well.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,"I've been using Burst Thor's on my FH and Mech-Tek on my BH (penhold) for a while and really like both.I recently saw that Gambler now has Burst with the Gearz sponge, and also X3 Diamond with Gearz (a mechanical grippy rubber).How does Burst Gearz compare to Burst Thor's?How does X3 Diamond Gearz compare to Mech-Tek?Any thoughts would be appreciated."
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I haven't been able to find any good information about these rubbers despite intensive googling.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The guy who owns the company that makes Gambler rubbers posts on this forum Maybe he'll chip in here.Iskandar
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I have used Burst and X3 Diamond with GearZ sponge.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,However I have not used either Burst Thor's or Mech-Tek.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The GearZ sponge is supposedly less hard and more bouncy than the Thor while being harder than the older sponge used on the Gambler rubbers.
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I liked the Burst GearZ but felt like I wanted something a bit harder (for me).
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,The X3 Diamond is let down by its top sheet being hard and brittle (mine cracked at the edges where it may have hit the table).
10,5f6c270f6d99ef02106d72a4,Gambler Zero Blue diamond/Big Gun/Burst Thor's hammer??,I have not had the cracking issue on other brands or even with the Burst.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"I bought a sheet to try and would say this, in play the rubber is quite good and like it was posted above pretty comparable to H3."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,But what made me go back to the h3 was spin on serve.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I couldn’t get enough with the Burst.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Just to complete the Burst review.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Played yesterday against partners and my previous comments stand.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"From the partners' perspective, there was little difference between H3 and Burst/Thor in terms of spin and the famous dip after bounce."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I did intentionally close my blade a bit more with the Burst to offset the higher arc but that was the only modification made.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Blocks against power loops and slow topspins were about equal.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,There was one difference re: previous post on serve.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,The Burst/Thor was as spinny--if not more--than the H3.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"My serves, however, are graze-thin and, when effective, both rubbers were dangerous on the serve."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Considering the higher tackiness on the Burst, this may not be altogether surprising.Conclusion: this is a great H3 alternative."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Since the USD price is only $4.50 between them, any preference would be justified by the push/flick difference in your play with the proviso that going from H3 to Burst will require a slight close on blade angle (or more forward stroke)."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks for the review Epictetus!
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,One question for you: what about the weight?
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Burst with Thor's sponge vs H3 neo?
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I looked for something slightly more dynamic than H3Neo and tested the Nittaku H3 Pro Turbo and that rubber was SOOO heavy.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks !
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,..
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Funny, I am using Burst Thors Hammer and H3 Neo on 2 defplays.The Burst was really good, but the throw angle was higher, particularly on drives and blocks."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"On pushes the high throw was problematic at first, but in the opposite direction because it's a push, your pushes go into the net."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"After some adjustment time, this is manageable, but your room for error is less."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"The Speed is far more on the Burst, so less effort for loops, blocks with more speed, but more care needs to be taken on pushes and chops."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"The H3 is definitely spinnier on just about everything, particularly on serves, and even more so on short serves.Both chop well, I prefer the H3 because of the lower throw."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"If it weren't for the difference on service, I'd likely prefer the Burst as it's more Euro feeling with the Thor's Hammer sponge.The H3 is tackier, even though it is older and more used than the Burst."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,We'll see if the Burst increases in tack...the H3 did.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Great info...
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks!What about weight difference between both?
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"I didn't weigh them on a scale, but the Burst with Thors is definitely lighter."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I'd say quite a bit lighter.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,"Good rubber, great value."
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Awesome.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Thanks!
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,I saw that Gambler recently released the Burst with the Gearz sponge.
11,5f6c27116d99ef02106d72a5,GAMBLER BURST W/THOR HAMMER SPONGE VS HURRICANE 3 NEO,Anyone know what this sponge is like compared to the Thor's?
12,5f6c27156d99ef02106d72a8,Experiences on chopping with Hurricane 3 (boosted/unboosted),Chopping with H3 is a lot!
12,5f6c27156d99ef02106d72a8,Experiences on chopping with Hurricane 3 (boosted/unboosted),easier than with T05.
12,5f6c27156d99ef02106d72a8,Experiences on chopping with Hurricane 3 (boosted/unboosted),Even fast spins u can chop.
12,5f6c27156d99ef02106d72a8,Experiences on chopping with Hurricane 3 (boosted/unboosted),With T05 on my fast blade it is very difficult.
12,5f6c27156d99ef02106d72a8,Experiences on chopping with Hurricane 3 (boosted/unboosted),If u boost the rubber chopping is less easy but still good versus T05.Li Dong Li (older female player in the dutch highest women comp) chops with boosted H3 and wins 75% of her games.Greetings
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"I would look into Friendship/729 rubbers - Focus 3 Snipe, probably."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Hi,I'm assuming that you're currently using the old/original Palio AK47...."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"The newer variants, ie."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"AK47 Red, Yellow Sponge, Blue are a lot lighter..."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"The Yellow Sponge, is the heaviest of the 3, but is still lighter than the old/original AK47.The newer Red, Yellow, Blue variants, differ in speed, and hardness... Red, being the hardest and fastest, and Blue being the softest."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Yellow sits between the Red & Yellow...
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"I've tried the Yellow, and Blue, and I quite like both, as long as they're paired with a blades that're on the stiffer side..."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,I second Ziv's suggestion of the Focus III Snipe...
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,It comes in different sponge hardness...
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"I'm using one (On another setup) that has a sponge hardness of 39° - 41° ... You could also check-out various rubbers by LKT/KLT, Yinhe, and other Chinese brands..."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"They all have inexpensive, and some light-weight options."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Just be mindful that a light rubber will not play the same as a heavy one.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Usually the light ones have a softer sponge, which will play differently."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Yasaka Shining Dragon is a mid-hard rubber but much lighter than Chinese stuff.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Only problem is removing rubber from blade ... you HAVE TO USE Nailpolish Remover or Acetone to remove it, else the topsheet will separate from the sponge from the slightest tension of pulling it."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Go for 729 OEM ... or 729 SuperFX ( FX-C if u want slower ).
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Thanks folks- my current AK47 has red/peach sponge and yellow sponge.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Perhaps I will just change the yellow sponge for something different.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,viewtopic.php?f=44&t=25211Lightweight?
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Try KTL Green Dragon.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,That is one radically light rubber.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Also 868 is a little lighter than normal (but it's got 2.0mm sponge rather than 2.2, despite what it says on the package)."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Iskandar
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Change your AK to the blue version.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Will play similar but one of the lightest rubbers there is.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Sounds like the old AK47, actually.Blue is lighter?"
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,I dunno...Palio AK47 Blue red	60.99g	168x168mm	0.216g/cm^2Not THAT light.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Plenty of lighter Chinese sheets.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"These are light:KTL Pro-XT ""Green Dragon"" black 47.77g	163x167mm	0.177g/cm^2KTL Pro-XT black 53.23g	166x168mm	0.193g/cm^2Iskandar"
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,That's odd (or is it ?
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,given how inconsistent some these Chinese products are) ...
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"If I recollect correctly, mine weighed around 53 gms."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"uncut... Could not weigh, just the rubber, post cutting, since it's glued to the blade, and then cut."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"But, we could shave-off a min."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,of 8-10gms (I have a larger blade head)..
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"So, at less than 45gms cut, I'd say, it's still quite light, comparatively."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Then, if the weight:performance, is taken into consideration, the rubber is well worth-it"
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"It's not just ""Chinese products"" that are inconsistent."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Have a look in Haggis's rubber sheet weight database (kinda too lazy to get you a URL right now) and you'll see that even expensive Japanese and German sheets vary a lot in weight.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"German sheets can be pretty heavy, too."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Only a year or so ago people were complaining that Nexy Karis sheets had HUGE weight differences, and that's a $50 sheet."

13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Tempted to try some KTL XT as they are pennies on Aliexpress!Sadly I think QC is a major problem with cheaper items of any description these days.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"I've used Tuttle Beijing 4, and found it a ridiculously good rubber for such a cheap price."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,If you're in the mood to try something different...
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Actually, I'd say MOST Chinese rubbers are of really good quality."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"There ARE a few with QC problems, most notably those KTL Gold Star sheets I bought a couple years back."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,And Palio - the new AK47s seem OK quality wise but their older sheets were really hit and miss.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Prices are low because - well, Chinese goods can be made at a low price for various reasons."

On the other hand, a fellow club-mate bought the same one in Red, around the same time, and it plays kind of weird - The ball seems to just slip of the rubber...I've found major inconsistencies with the balls - More recently, with DHS D40+ (Ding Ning on the box) ..."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"I bought a box of 10, around a week back, which seems to look and play, differently from lots, I had purchased 3-6 months back..."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"The newer lot balls, seem whiter, have more bounce (here, I find inconsistencies within balls of the same lot itself), and feel heavier.."

13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Of all those rubber abundance, I do prefer those 42* stiff sponges to offer me a true dynamical linearity."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Yes.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,Dynamical Linearity means a minimum of Catapultive effects.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,I hate those sudden ball projections on my rubber.
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"Mind you, they are a little slower than a lot of other Chinese rubbers (even the Green Dragon)."
13,5f6c27236d99ef02106d72b2,Lightweight/Inexpensive Rubbes,"I suspect Red Dragon would be about as light, and is nontacky, so it might be faster than the Green Dragon.Iskandar"

15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,If you find FXS a bit soft you could try one of the harder Tibhar rubbers in the same series such as MXP or MXS or perhaps Aurus Prime
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,Thank You for the reply.
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,I play close (mostly)- mid distance from the table.
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,"Typically, hard rubbers are not recommended to be paired with the Blue Devil."
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,The reason I am inclined towards the Chinese style rubbers is due to their tackiness that I felt would assist me with the spin in addition to the control more than the Euro/ Jap style rubbers despite being hard/ mid-hard.
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,"I'm not familiar with Hurricane Turbo, heard its faster than the original Hurricane which was itself a notch faster than the 999T."
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,"The 999 series is really old, think Hurricane predecessors the likes of G888 which I used extensively during my early days."
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,"I would say more suited to close-to-the-table, nothing flips better than slow tacky rubbers, but mid-distance, you'll have to work alot harder."
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,"For away from the table, I much preferred faster, lower arched tensors.Nevertheless, for nostalgia sake, I'm picking up a 999 sheet for fun"
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,999 is one of the few rubbers that will work when it's really humid.
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,Which reminds me..
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,"I should make up another bat with 999 on it, some days it's been REALLY humid here."
15,5f6c272a6d99ef02106d72b7,999T or Nittaku Hurricane Turbo on Donic Waldner Back Devil,The Globe stuff and the 999 Corporation stuff is pretty similar.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,Is there a reason why you're using 1.7mm sponge on the backhand?
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,The problem is most Chinese rubbers (including Taiji) only come in one thickness (usually 2.2mm).
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"Not really a problem IMHO for most people, what with the 40mm ball."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I was curious so I had a look.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,The cheapest T88-Taiji on AliExpress I found was this:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Sh ... 56317.htmlQuite confusing - it lists all these sponge thicknesses but it turns out there's only one (2.2mm) available!

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"I honestly can't tell the difference - and to be honest most Chinese sheets (bar, say, Hurricane III and Ckylin) are almost indistinguishable from each other anyway."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"To muddy the waters - there's apparently a ""New Taiji"" out now too:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/SANWEI- ... 57814.htmlThis costs more like $12-13."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"Despite the new cover it's got the old T88-Taiji ""headstamp""."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"And interestingly enough - it's got two LONG corners cut off, like Target National."

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"And Tensors really aren't all that much faster or hard to use, in the end I can play with almost anything, it doesn't effect my game very much."

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,Rakza 7 has the reputation of being soft (though not necessarily slow) and supposedly is capable of lots of spin.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I can't recommend a soft-rubber below 2mm unless you're absolutely sure about what you are doing.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"Going for a fast rubber but to get a thin sponged one because 'it may be too fast at >1.8mm' doesn't make sense at all, especially not on a spring-sponge or tensor where you want to get the most bang for your buck.Nevertheless, since I can't judge on your backhand-preferences, the Taiji may be an option as a softer chinese type of rubber with below-average weight."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"There are a lot of players out there who are fine with 729 SuperFX and similar rubbers on their backhand and a more expensive, state-of-the-art rubber would be a waste of money."

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I specified that my current rubber was 1.7mm by way of telling you what I was currently using and neglected to specify that I wasn't looking to get a similarly thin sponge.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"I'm currently looking at those rubbers in the 2.0/2.1mm thickness and, if that isn't available, in Max thickness."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I bought my current BH rubber at a time I wasn't too sure whether I would be able to handle a faster rubber and thought a thinner sponge would provide more control.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"Now, after playing more, I realize my fears were unfounded."
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I now realize it wouldn't have made too much of a difference.I did find that vendor on AliExpress and also noticed that they only have Max thickness.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,My question was related to whether I should go for the Taiji (36 degree sponge which is a bit on the soft side) or one of the tensors that I specified.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,"At my current level of play, I don't think I will have any issues but couldn't decide and was hoping someone had some experience with those rubbers to guide me."

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I had bought my current paddle at Iskandar's recommendation and am extremely satisfied with that decision.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I was hoping to get some insights from people who had used these rubbers that could similarly guide my decision.Thanks again for your valuable inputs!
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,Hmm interesting.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I'll try playing again with the racket tomorrow and see if I can tell the difference.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,This is that infamous rubber with both tacky and nontacky versions (if it's the same topsheet - how is it possible?

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,Their quality control also seems to be lacking looking at the cut of those sheets.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,My impression was that tensors would last at least 5-6 months (I play only about 8 hours a week) even if their performance wouldn't be as good towards the end.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,That just makes them way overpriced and unaffordable.
16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I'm not into boosting rubbers nor do I want to spend an excessive amount of money.

16,5f6c27396d99ef02106d72c1,Backhand rubber - Sanwei T-88 Taiji/Palio Aeolus/neither?,I did consider buying it but would rather buy the paddle and rubbers separately if it means sealing it properly and putting on rubbers that I'm more likely to like/keep.

17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,The speed is what you have to account for more.
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,I like that trade off.
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,This is why I suspect Jo Parker and Satoshi Aida like chopping with tensor-like rubbers.

17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,I wonder if Feint AG would be more to your liking.
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,1.1mm is the thinnest I think.
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,Nittaku revspin goes down to 1.2mm sponge.

17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,"I mean, tenergy is not a ""Tensor"" so who knows if there is the supposed stretching of the topsheet."
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,"The sponge is ""spring sponge"" aka fast enough.So, in that sense, I do believe it's a ""tensor"" aka ""faster"" than classic rubbers."
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,"Strictly speaking, ""Tensor(tm)"" is a brand name that belongs to ESN."
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,So a Tensor is a Tensor if ESN makes it and SAYS it is a Tensor.

17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,I guess the issue here is that can long pips (especially OX long pips) be Tensor-type rubbers at all?

17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,Some hit with their pips... some like not having to come forward on their chop stroke to generate pace.
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,Same reasons...faster is less effort to generate speed or distance.
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,"And it depends on the blade speed.For example, when i chop with Feint Long 3 on a defplay, it takes so much effort to get the ball back on the table at distance, I start to get arm pain and shoulder pain unless my body rotation is on point."
17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,"Same technical things as looping, but the stroke is going toward the floor instead of going toward the ceiling."

17,5f6c27436d99ef02106d72c5,Modern rubber with THIN sponge 1.0mm or less?,I still like the control of thinner sponge tho.

18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,I was looking for something in US to order from just for time and shipping charges.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,I checked that paddle palace website.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,Of the rubbers they stock and that I've used the one that has characteristics most similar to Marder 2 would be Dr Neubauer Domination.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,But it's quite expensive.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,TBH many of the classic rubbers play very similar despite being slightly less tacky.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"So, no spinlord products in the US?"
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,All I can see is an email address:https://spinlord-tt.de/welcome/distributors/

18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,Preferably not too expensive.

18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,May I make a suggestion that's from out in left field?
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,TinArc 5.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"Turns out to be quite different from TinArc 3, fairly soft sponge."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,I was trying it out as a forehand rubber and I now mainly use it on the backhand (which I think it was designed for) because it was a fair amount slower than I thought it'd be.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"AND it makes a decidedly ""THUNK"" sound when you hit the ball."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"It's in the $20 range more or less on AliExpress (including shipping), price varies quite a bit (there's a major sale coming in 3-4 days), and it won't break the bank."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,Definitely cheaper than Tenergy at any rate...  Iskandar
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,A couple more non tensor rubbers I have used that may work for you are:Xiom Musa 1.5/1.8 blackGewo return drive 1.7mm blackThe Musa is medium hard in feel with a lowish throw and low tack whilst the Gewo is a bit softer and slightly tacky.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"Both are very linear and suit controlled topspin drives, blocks and chops on balsa or wood blades."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,Thank you both for the suggestions!
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,I really appreciate it!
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,After t80 fx your attack will suffer badly with the alternatives mentioned on a Defplay imo
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,Yes classic sponge rubbers like Musa & Gewo return drive need at least an all+ bladeXiom Asia df in 1.8mm is very grippy and good for chopping as well as attacking.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,Why is that?
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,To generate enough pace with the polyball on defense blades for modern defensive one really needs to use a fast rubber.I like both Musa and Gewo on fast balsa blades but on slowish blades not enough pace for forehand attack.
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"Donic Bluefire JP 01 was used by Shiono for chop/attack on Defplay not so long ago and I noticed a good offer on TTNPP with free delivery,I may try this myself eventuallyI did try Marder 2 on Defplay and the combination did not work for me"
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"That makes sense to me, and with the setup I have, I still do have enough pop, especially with the Tenergy 80fx, which is really lovely on this blade."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"I also cut the defplay down to a standard size blade, and it changed a bit."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"I am playing Air Defence on the backhand now, and have tried short pips before, which was ok, but I did not find I had the attacking capacity with it as I do inverted."
18,5f6c27466d99ef02106d72c7,Chopping/attack rubber,"I do appreciate all the suggestions, so keep them coming!"
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,"Hi, I have used the Focus III extensively 5 years ago and recently bought the AK47 Blue."
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,For a direct comparison the AK47 Blue is slightly faster but actually significantly less grip so you are not going to get higher throw from it.
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,It is also a little bit heavier (but still in the light rubbers category so not too much of a concern).
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,"For a cheapy with higher surface grip, try the ktl series (pro XP, Rapid Sound etc) both are almost as light and a bit more spinny, speed as with the Focus on the medium-low side."
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,I always felt F+S III was a very soft rubber but Palio AK-47 blue is a lot harder and heavier sponge.
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,FSIII is better and easier at flat kills and brush loops.
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,AK-47 blue is more loop kill and loop drive and needs a very pronounced stroke and not very forgiving.
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,"I am unable to compare ""throw"" for either as I tried these rubbers on different blades and felt it was close enough to feel the same."
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,"AK-47 comes in red,yellow and blue branding and I don't know about the other 2 since have not tried them."
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,Thank you man iii and lasta for your replies.I actually went and bought a pair of Gewo Hype EL 40 rubbers in 1.9 sponge about 3 months ago.Have to say I've been very impressed with them so far.
19,5f6c274a6d99ef02106d72ca,Friendship Focus III Snipe / Palio AK47 Blue,"My game has improved noticeably.They are a tiny bit heavier than the Snipe III but I got used to the weight difference very quickly.They play similar to the Snipe but offer a little more control / placement and a lot more spin.The throw is also slightly higher than the Snipe and the arc is greater too.In fact I would say that they do everything that the Snipe did but just that little bit better in all aspects.Speed, control, spin are all noticeably better with the Hype El 40.Is the Hype EL worth the extra cost compared to the Snipe?All things considered I would say yes."
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,"This depends on your technique and how hard you hit.If you hit hard, a harder rubber will be better because the maximum spin and speed you can generate is more."
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,For slower shots your timing and technique has to be really good.
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,"Otherwise balls will go to the net.If you don't have a hard stroke and your timing is not always perfect (for example with less than perfect footwork) you should go for a softer rubber, for example stay at your rubber and increase thickness.I would probably increase the thickness first."
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,"If you then max it out and need more power, go for the harder rubber."
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,If you are happy with the current feel go max.
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,"Otherwise, go to a harder sponge - feel may completely change though."
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,I'd go for the max.
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,"It will let you spin the ball harder, which will also allow you to increase the speed without missing the table."
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,Hard would help but I think max would come first.
20,5f6c27854272aba9ab775685,Increase rubber speed - Hardness or Thickness,"This assumes you're looping, of course."

21,5f6c27894272aba9ab775687,Tibhar Evolution EL-P or EL-S,Lots of comparison reviews out there just Google it.
21,5f6c27894272aba9ab775687,Tibhar Evolution EL-P or EL-S,E.ghttp://blog.tabletennis11.com/tibhar-ev ... ers-reviewelS is supposed to be spinnier not faster.You could try AUrus Prime which is supposed to give a bit more control than MXP/MXS whilst still fast.
21,5f6c27894272aba9ab775687,Tibhar Evolution EL-P or EL-S,"And then you begin to wonder at how they compare to, say, the Rasanters, or to Rakza..  Iskandar"
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Without knowing enough about your level or how long you have been playing or what your playing style is it is hard to give good advice but I will try.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,If you like to step away from the table and play loops and topspin drives then the Tenergy is a great rubber for that.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,The blade is also a factor.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,A good looping blade such as the Nittaku Violin will also be high throw so you need to adjust accordingly.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Maybe you need to stand a bit further back than you already are?
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Maybe your technique is the issue?
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Faster hand speed will always help the ball curve down more and land on the table.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"More brushing, less hitting through the ball."
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"I am just assuming a lot of things about your game here.If you plan to play a close-to-the-table kind of game, are you saying you want to play a more push block sort of game?"
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,In that case I don't think the Tenergy is the right rubber since it is springy and high throw.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"You will need a stiffer racket or a harder sponge, or both for that type of game to work."
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,T05 is fine for close to the table controlled spin play.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"You will need more compact strokes to adjust to the shorter recovery time, that's all.And it's a good general rule to change one thing at a time."
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"So change your preferred distance now, keep the same equipment."
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"When you settle in at the new distance, if you still want to change equipment then do it."
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,That way you will get a clear evaluation of each change.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Thanks for the advance.I played County as a kid and had a low national ranking.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,(mid 90s) then had a 10 year break played in local league for a season and won promotion from middle division of 5 to 2nd top (top division contained players from strong British league teams).
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Currently back in local league... Making too many mistakes and wanting to push on and get promoted up the divisions.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Using Primorac off- blade
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,The main drawback of Tenergy 05 is that it's quite sensitive to incoming spin from your opponent.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"So if that's the cause of many mistakes, and it outweighs the number of winners you hit, only then it'w worth considering something else.Are you using 2.1mm or 1.9mm?"
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,"The blade is certainly good for looping, with tons of control."
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,I always preferred 64 over 05 for short action/close to the table counterlooping.
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,But I don't think it was intended for that...
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Short pips?
22,5f6c278e4272aba9ab77568b,Stick with Tenergy 05 or change??,Iskandar
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Have you tried VS>402?
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,It's more all rounded with better attacking potential.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Tibhar Super Defense still works great.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Didn't tried it but it's not what I look for.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,V>15 should be better here.You didn't understand me  I don't look for typical defensive rubber.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"My goal is to make a setup based on professional players setup, especially Joo, who is the closest to my style."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"I know, I'm not professional player, I won't use 100% of its possibilities but if T64 is best for such style, I want to put it and practise practise practise with this setup to get better and better."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Only disadvantage is the price- if it was cheaper I would buy it and don't ask You for advice.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,My question should sound like: do You know any good alternative rubber for T64 (low trajectory and high spin with good control)?
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,There are probably DOZENS of rubbers that would fit the bill.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,And a lot of people would have a hard time telling them apart.Iskandar
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I know  that's why i have indecision  But from my experience Evolution is the closest to Tenergy- which one should be closest to T64?
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Their price is not bad (there is sale in my shop- you get free Tibhar Evo t-shirt for buying rubber  )and quality is very high that's why I think about this series.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,And here is next question- is it worth to pay 20$ more for Tenergy if you can get almost the same cheaper
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I'm also looking into a new forehand rubber for my defensive game.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I've been using short pips on my forehand for ages but I'm considering making a switch back to inverted on the forehand side.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"After a little research last night, I'm thinking of trying Donic Bluefire M3."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Alternatively, I could try a new tensor style short pip..."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Snowmam, for me M3 could be way too soft, I like harder rubbers"
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I don't think I was way off with the rubber I mentioned.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,All the people that I know use it for both defense and attack as in modern defender style.Noone I know use it for purely attacking game nor purely defensive game.I tried it briefly and agree that it's easier to use for attack and defence.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Easier to use it defensively than other offensive rubbers.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"For me, I could play both offensive and defensive easier and better with it than using T05 (for me easier to use offensively than defensively).If you are higher level and/or want to put in the hours then you could any offensive rubbers and use it defensively too like Joo, etc.My recommendation in part because it works good right now and better the longer you put practice into it, compare getting something like T64 which will work after putting some long hours into it."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"It's cheaper, last long, high spin, very good control."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Hmmm, I dont want any defensive rubber because I tried Vs>401 and Marder (I or II) and both were playing wrong for me."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"I don't say that You are wrong, maybe Super Defense is very good rubber but probably not for me- it seems to be similar to VS>401 and Marder that i dont like."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"I can't tell what level I am because there is no TT Rank in my country but I'm developing all the time because I'm just 22yo, lost my weight, I'm getting faster and faster with my legs."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,And You wrote the holy truth- after buying one of Tenergy I will need a lot of practise but it will repay after some time.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I decided to risk and buy Tenergy.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,However I dont know which one...
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,There are different opinions about them.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Most says that T64 is best for chopping, but Joo probably changed it to T05 (why?)."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Apart from that, there is interesting picture telling us that while generating backspin (chopping) T05 has lowest trajectory (which I look for) http://en.butterflymag.com/2015/06/all-about-tenergy-22/But here the author criticize T05 for chopping and praise T64 for that: https://www.tabletennisspot.com/review-butterfly-tenergy-05-vs-64/What do You think about that?"
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"I would not put too much trust into this specific review: reviewer pretty much enumerates his equipment history as a 6$ Sportscraft paddle from Walmart, another premade from Stiga and then jumps into TBS and Tenergy."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"No idea about the level or play style, and frankly the site itself and reviews seem to exist only to show you Amazon affiliate ads.I'll also bet my nonexistent family farm that reviewer is not a chopper and most likely refers to pushes as 'chops'."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"So, caveat emptor."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I am surprised by the issues you had with H8.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I have a sheet of H8 on my old Defplay and it's quite spinny even with the tackiness almost entirely worn off - I get a lot of mileage off of serves with that setup.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"In that case, go for Tenergy 05."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"But I would recommend the 05FX just because it's softer and would be easier to chop with (well, for me that is, I find softer rubber is better for my fh chopping)."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"As time goes by when the rubber is worn and time to get a new one, you can get the 05.The article you mentioned already gives you a lot of description and also example of users."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Closest to what you want would be example of Gionis using the 05.If you're still unsure, compromise and get the 80."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"Use it until it's worn out and use it as benchmark to which you're leaning toward, the 05 or 64."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,I think all of the Tenergy rubbers chop well on the FH.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,All of them.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,In any thickness.I also think Evo MX-P chops well.I personally love Omega IV Asia in 2.0mm for chopping.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Similar to T64 but a tad spinnier.
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"I have only borrowed Omega V Asia and attempted chopping, but that was easy.I am currently using Omega VII Pro in max."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"It chops well.Regalis and Karis (the new ""linear"" tensors) also chop well in any thickness.I have heard good things about V15 too.So in summary...all of them will work."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Thanks for valuable answers!
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,Had a practise session today and I analysed my game.

23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,"So why couldn't I play with Tenergy on VKM  I will probably take 05, try it out for about 3 months, if I won't be able to play with it, I will back to H8."
23,5f6c27964272aba9ab77568f,Tensor rubber for modern defender-T64/Tibhar Evo or another?,And last question- 2.1mm or 1.9mm?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,The traditional answer is Tenergy 05 or Evolution MX-P MX-S or EL-S.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,You need to develop some muscles... A fellow club member here could blast the ball with it using a defense blade...

24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I was thinking about trying out the bluefire series from donic, m2 or m1 turbo maybe."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,There is a decent chance they are hitting it faster because of better technique.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,How long you've been playing TT and what is your current level?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,It's pretty much impossible to say for sure without a video - so that would help too.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,As an aside comment - you don't always need to hit fastest to win a point/match.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I agree with pgpg, the Shiwen+Barracuda shouldn't be that slow at all and my guess is that the energy of your stroke doesn't really get to the ball or in the hit."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Also, not getting enough spin in combination with your strokes makes me guess that there's quite some potential to achieve just by improving the technique."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Yeah, I would second this, that setup should have plenty of speed and spin."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,But without seeing you play it is difficult to judge.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Unless you are playing at a really high level already this setup should have plenty of what you need.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"It's similar speed wise to my setup, and I don't suffer any issues with this."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I have issues with me not getting into position for the shot, but not with my equipment."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I am not sure but I guess there is a reason why good players od not use baracuda after all, speed-wise sure it is somewhat better than what you would get on a premade racket, but it is simply not enough to compete with."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"The price was fairly acceptable though, so that is I guess a selling point."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Who are you competing against and how long you've been playing?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,What's your playing level?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I used Baracuda quite a few times when I beat players at the USATT 2200 level in league matches.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I also know players at the USATT 2400 level who use Baracuda.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Yes, there might be a reason world class players don't use a rubber but once you start confusing yourself with a world class player, you can get some silly results unless you are on a somewhat similar growth trajectory."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Baracuda is slower than those rubbers.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Not any less spinny.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,If you want to base your game more on speed and power then use those rubbers.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,But it's not a miracle thing.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I have used a lot of equipment and my level stays fairly similar regardless.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,If you hit the ball faster the round trip time is faster and you need to adjust to that.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,All about technique good sir.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I've been obliterated by a 1900 level player in their mid 50's multiple times.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"He uses barracuda on his FH, and uses a Donic Defplay blade which is pretty darn slow in comparison."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,He's taught me a very valuable lesson.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"It's not how fast you can hit a ball by someone that will win you matches, it's about strategy and placement that will win you games."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Barracuda has a crap ton of spin, and tons of control, use the rubber's strengths to your advantage."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,pgpg - You use to use Donic Barracuda if I'm not mistaken.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,What did you love about the rubber?What did you hate about it?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Why did you move onto another rubber?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"If you are talking about me, then I'm 1800 at best ."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Also, last time we played, you beat me, I think, but that was before you switched to pips...I originally got Baracuda because everyone was raving about its spin, which it has plenty, plus some people said it chops well."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I have not really hated anything in particular, still have it an old sheet on one of my blades."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"It is somewhat sensitive to spin, if I were to pick something."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Moved away from it mostly due to exploration and desire to try something else (also Rasant went on sale, IIRC)."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I know a handful good players that use baracuda both sides or on the forehand and they are all north of 2000 with the highest being 2300.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"The 2300 (peak was above 2400) player used to play with H3 on his FH, switched to baracuda, and is known for his step around FH power."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"He is a 2 winged looper from china, coaches, and is a good friend of mine...some on here have played him."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,He plays with it on a TB ALC.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"He actually chose baracuda because it was faster than his H3, but slower than his Tenergy."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,So take that for what it means.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"He has never played with anything other than Tenergy 05, H3, or Tenergy 64 (typical Chinese junior story from age 6 to now 20).But the reason that ""most"" don't play with alternative rubbers manufacturers is because of Butterfly's very successful marketing strategy, or DHS' dominance of the CNT forehand rubber strategy."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Most juniors getting coached by a chinese coach will start with Tenergy and/or Hurricane because that's what they are given.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"And from there they never give equipment a second thought afterwards, and then they become elite."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Likely their club is sponsored by Butterfly, and since Tenergy is the zeitgeist or the rubber paradigm for inverted spinny rubbers most of the players use it simply by default."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Essentially what I'm saying is that Baracuda or any Tensor is good enough and has enough speed given the right technique.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"But, certainly there are a billion tensors out there with more speed, but there will always be trade offs in your game."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Speed isn't always ""better"" or caused by the rubber."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"In fact there are several pros that play with Tenergy FX rubbers at times (Harimoto, Kreanga) and those were fast enough for them, and T05FX is definitely slower than Baracuda IMO.For me, I prefer the Baracuda's slightly slower speed over T05 and MX-P on my new Viscaria...I just bought the blade, but this rubber/blade combo certainly has enough speed for my level (1630)."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,And it seems to be good enough for Bojun (2400).
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Perhaps you are far above my level, but just adding some perspectives and observations here."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Like everyone said, hard to comment without knowing your level, technique, and style."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I am not from the USA, so I can not tell what my rating would be in that system."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Also I think everyone can always improve technique no matter what rating / skill one has.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"I really just wanted to know if there are objectively seen, from just pure data, better alternatives that would give me a better chance in an actual competition (both spin and speed wise)."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Also it nice to see that some talented individuals can scrap by with the setup, but that does not really mean that the setup is so good, its more like they are just skilled enough to perform even with substandard equipment."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I changed from Baracuda to Tibhar Evolution MX-S and I can say that the spin is comparable if not better(MX-S is very spinny) and in terms of speed MX-S is much faster on my blade (which is a defensive blade(Joola Toni Hold White Spot)).But I must say that my technique is more suited for chinese type of rubbers so I just couldn't get the speed I needed from Baracuda.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,And I've got no problems with the MX-S.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,But you should be ready that these are quite different rubbers and the touch game with them is also different.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"No, different player... Wasn't referring to you good sir, although I can see how you'd think I was."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Last time you and I played, was back in October when I had just made the switch from inverted to LP OX (dr. N Gangster) and squeaked a game 5 winner from ya at BTTC ."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"If memory serves me correctly, you were using Victas rubber for forehand and maybe Cloud and fog 3?I'm still not happy with my forehand rubber, I refuse to pay the tenergy prices anymore (which means: the wife says no), and have hopped back and forth between Victas 15>Extra and Tibhar Evolution MX-S and cannot seem to find a happy medium.. Barracuda has the spin factor I'm looking for, I just don't think it will match the speed I'm looking for though."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Fair enough.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,I guess I just disagree with your assertion that it's 'substandard.'
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Whether a rubber is substandard is relative to the user, and that's my point."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Bojun thinks it's superior to Tenergy and H3.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"If speed = superior to you, then just buy fast spinny rubbers...any of the suggestions above are good enough."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Whether it improves your game outcomes is another question.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Getting off the dead horse that we've beaten.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"So question, have you hit with any other faster rubbers?"
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,Did they help?
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,A person with proper technique and knowledge of the sport will perform well regardless of the equipment that is in his/her hand.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"When you state, ""I really just wanted to know if there are objectively seen, from just pure data, better alternatives that would give me a better chance in an actual competition (both spin and speed wise)."""
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"For me, your statement creates questions of whether or not your focus should be on which equipment is going to give you that ""edge"" in competition or just utilize the setup you have and focus on training and mastering your technique in order to use the set up to it's fullest potential."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Of course this is all subjective without knowing how long you've played the sport, if you've had any coaching, and how many times a week you play or not seeing any video of your play."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Generally speaking from my own personal experience, when you start looking at equipment and thinking it's going to save your game or give you that edge in competition, it's best to just put your head down and train harder with the equipment you have."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,My take on this is that rubber matters a great deal less than blade.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,When trying out different rubbers ( the only way to do it is back-to-back on the same blade) I usually have to stop and think about what I'm experiencing.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Differences are usually quite subtle (unless you are talking about, say, Reactor Ckylin)."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,My motivation for trying all sorts of rubbers is different from other people's - in most cases it's to verify what someone has written about some rubber or another.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,In most cases the result has been disappointment - I am pretty sure by now that there isn't any magic rubber that will immediately give me twice the spin or double the speed of whatever I am using at the moment.
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Not even 10% more, or even 5%."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Most rubbers play pretty well, and are usable by most people and they don't affect my game."
24,5f6c27c04272aba9ab7756a7,Faster/spinnier than baracuda?,"Now, if I were a much better player perhaps my opinion would be different, perhaps I would be able to use some of these rubbers to better effect, but I think that would apply more to the likes of H3 than to Tensors.Blades, on the other hand...  Iskandar"
25,5f6c27db4272aba9ab7756b9,BEST RUBBER FOR CHOPPING (DONIC OR ANDRO)?,There are a ton of fast spinny tensors that are great for looping and fast drives but not so many that will excel equally at chopping and short play.
25,5f6c27db4272aba9ab7756b9,BEST RUBBER FOR CHOPPING (DONIC OR ANDRO)?,"I found that I am able to chop rather well with Andro Hexer Duro, but if controlled and consistent chopping is as important to you as fast topspin a classic such as Donic Coppa would be a more balanced choice."

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Iskandar
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The head coach at one of our local clubs (used to coach me, a year or two ago) is also of the stronger players in our area (lost only one game in the top division this summer) used Tackiness Chop and Palio CJ8000 all last season."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"He's one of the best BH loopers in the region, and the spin on his serves is remarkable."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Would he be more dangerous with tensors?
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"He once said to me: I'll never use Tenergy - I know my limits - I can't control it well enough in the short game, and be delicate enough on serve."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"So maybe he would on power shots, but he's perfectly happy with ""legacy"" rubbers, and good technique."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Furthermore, he'd say there's a connection there - using classic rubbers is a good way to ensure you do develop good technique."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,One of the better players in our club filled in last night after a couple month layoff.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Couldn't find his bat which is Andro Supercore OFF+ with Hexer.I lent him my spare - Yasaka Extra with Haifu Whale and Nittaku Zalt, I'd say significantly slower.At first he wasn't playing well and said he didn't like it as he had to 'work too hard' compared to just small movements to get speed with his bat."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I didn't see but apparently by the end of the night he was playing really well and landing everything.........Not sure what this means but I don't think hit had a lot to do with the bat, maybe the two month layoff could have been a factor."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I'm not using tensors but I will next season.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,There wasn't enough weeks left for it to to be worth investing in them this year.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I lost a game earlier this season but otherwise cleaned up on Donic Defplay TG3/MK V, Champion singles/doubles, Aggregate, Premiers."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,That's good enough rubber to do the job.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I'm still flirting with my Koji blade, it still chops very well but it's still such a poor looping blade it really needs a better rubber than TG3."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"With good looping blades rubbers are almost irrelevant , not the case when the blade isn't up for it.Next season I'll be using the JO shaped Donic senso carbon with Victas 401 and maybe Magic Carbon on BH."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,That's the best combination I've ever had a hit with.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Interesting.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I've always have my eye on the Donic Senso Carbon, have been thinking of a more tackier tensor like 401 and Magic Carbon had come up as an option for my next backhand rubber."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Sounds like my perfect setup you have there.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Would love to give try, might make the trek over for a go."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Then again for the cost of fuel I might as well buy one.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"On another note, I'm toying with doing an experiment next season and using my N11 with Cj8000 and Venus in it."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,It's a short 7 week season.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Would be interesting to see if my results are much different using a cheap generic Chinese type set up.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,As there is a five week break between seasons I'd have a chance to practice and make the necessary adjustments.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"There would then be another 6 weeks before the next season, plenty of time to adjust back again.I wonder if results would be much different."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,My concern would be perhaps hurting my game for the long term and wasting weeks of practice.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"My next proper seasonal break will be around January, when a 5-week Monday pennant is scheduled."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Usually our club runs two long Monday seasons (almost 4 months each) and two short ones (5 weeks each).
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"These overlap with 10-week seasons, that follow the 4 school terms, for Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I play Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, although Fridays is a smaller group that is often just round robin, rather than pennant teams.I can't really change until the short Monday season is the *only* pennant season, and that's during the summer break.Tell you what, Cobalt, if you commit to a short-season change, I will do the same and we can both report back on it."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"At this stage I'm thinking a Sanwei M8 blade with Yasaka Mark V 1.8mm BH and DHS Skyline 3-60 mid-hard – I know this isn't cheap generic Chinese (at best, it's not quite half-way), but it's a step back from my usual soft carbon, two-tensor rig.Personally I think it will be a test of sound technique: the more robust our technique, the better we'll adapt.What do you reckon?"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Gee, now you have put me on the spot."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Current season still has 4 weeks left then I'll decide.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,When does your new season start?
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I don't have a new non-overlapping short season until January.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Our current ~17-week Monday ""Spring"" pennant season (19 weeks counting 2 non-playing weeks) spans almost two of our 10-week pennant seasons on the other weekdays."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"We've finished Week 5 of the Monday Spring pennant with ~3 months more to go.So I can't do this, without excessive disruption, until the new year."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"But if you want to give it a shot, whether in the upcoming season or the next, I'm game…"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"In putting together my earlier post for this topic I reread the first couple of pages of my blog, and realised that I have had my current rubber on since 2011 - almost an eternity."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Mind you I haven't been playing much, mostly once a week up until a couple of months ago, and I do clean my rubber with a faux chamois after each session and place plastic over the rubber while it is still damp - both for Yasaka Xtend & 729 Geospin Tacky."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I have just had a conversation with SWAMBO, and it being Father's Day eve here she has agreed that I should get new rubber."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I mentioned that I could go for Tenergy at $99 (AU) per side, and that did not make her faint."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I think that is because she has a new hobby herself - woodturning and is looking to buy a lathe.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"She has already gotten a band saw, scroll saw & grinder secondhand.Remember, I am a retriever, usually using slowish, very spinny rubber on an old Nittaku Carbon blade."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Tenergy 05 max on both sides and see how it goes?
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I have used Mark 5 & Magic Carbon on the classic side, Joola Tango, Tango Extreme & Yasaka Xtend on the tensor side & Friendship RITC Tack Speed 2000 & 729 Geospin Tacky on the tacky Chinese side."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Tenergy would round out my exploration of types of inverted spinny rubber.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I ordered that for a fried a few years ago, don't own one myself yet but of all the blades I've put together that was easily the best general use blade."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The 401 was 1.8mm, magic carbon 1.5mm."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I've built up the standard Donic senso carbon before with cheap rubber, was still pretty bloody good."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Interesting to hear that.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I've come accross other people that have made that work, while I've also come accross some people that have ruined their rubbers the same way.... not quite sure why it work for some and not others..."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Probably the difference in their definition of ""damp"""
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,From Cobalt's blog:Yes!
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I've started down this road.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"This week, after trying out the setup at Saturday coaching, I played pennant on Monday and Wednesday with a US$7 5-ply all-wood Sanwei M8 (the current ""Junior"" version with the grey lens insert), a black Sanwei Target National 2.1mm that I'd previously tried and rejected on FH; and a well-used, recycled red Tibhar Aurus Soft 1.9mm on BH.I really like it."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I feel that I'm getting more touch and short-game control, and I can swing hard without worrying as much about launching the ball into orbit."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,The tacky FH maintains a nice kick on loops.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I actually meant to put a Hurricane 3 Neo (39°*, 2.15mm) on the FH and a Mark V 1.8mm on the BH, but was too impatient."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Not yet sure if I will keep the Target National and put a Mark V on this setup's BH for now.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Toying with the idea of sticking a cheap, hard-ish, tacky rubber on the BH** just to round out the change – someone tell me why it's a bad idea."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"edit: *Chinese 39°, i.e., closer to German 50°edit: ** 39° Hurricane 2 2.2mm on the backhand?"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Lower throw than H3N, right?"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Too hard-sponged for topspin flicks, or just fine?"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Yeah, I've been playing with a M8 for the last month (including a 2 week break from playing)."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Nice blade for control.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Haven't done any counterlooping drills in a while, though, so I seem to have forgotten how to loop in doubles games the last time I played - don't think it's the fault of the blade."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"It's particularly good for flips and over-the-table attacks of serve, especially for changing direction (inside out shots)."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I've got three more M8s - they all turned out to be the newer ""Junior"" M8s rather than the ""red"" M8 which was my first one."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Time will tell whether I go back to the N11 in the end, that's what's happened in the past with all the other blades I've bought, but I haven't liked one as much as this."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Current set-up: Forehand, Haifu Whale (training clear plastic packed, unboosted)."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Backhand: Yinhe 9000 (with red sponge, from a generic 2-pack, which is quite a bit lighter than the ""branded"" sheets with the cream sponge)."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The blade was very light (about 72 grams) so I went with the Whale (which is heavy - this one wasn't nearly as heavy as the first sheet I tried some months back, though)."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The newer ones weigh 74, 75 and 78 grams."

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Glad to know M8 is getting the love it deserves!
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Was about to post my experiment but see that hangdog beat me to it.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Good stuff!
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,!Whale is really good and I expect that the m8 is too.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,If the 9000 is half decent then that will be a top set up.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,So you've been trying a M8 as well?
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,How do you like it?The first sheet of whale I unpacked weighed a whopping 78 grams!!
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The second (which I'm using now) was ""only"" 68 - which is heavy not outstandingly heavy."

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I've M6 but haven't played with it.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Wonder what's the difference.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,You can't get a M6 for $7...  Iskandar

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Not as tacky as id expected, I'd say mildly tacky.Edit: Correct that, the plastic rubber sheets went on really well, so I'd have to upgrade my comment to Medium Tacky."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,The sheets were 40-43 hardness according to the box and were noticeably harder to the touch than the Donic Baracurda I'd been using..........see how we go.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"There are countless numbers of people on the net looking for advice whith messages more or less structured like this:-Having speedo-x-super blade and rubbers abc at 1.8 or 2.0mm which is a tensor (of course), usually priced at $40+-I do like it much but I have trouble with pushing/touch-balls/fliks etc."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"etc.,-Sound is great-I'd go with 1.5mm if it's available (reducing the tensor-effect quite remarkably, imho that is spoiling the basic reason of using a tensor)-Is there another alternative or does rubber xyz, efg etc (even so tensors, mostly the follow-up generation and usually somewhat more expensive) an alternative?Quite tiresome, imho.Most of the time they refuse to go with a more classical rubber which would indeed fix some of their issues."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Going cheap and/or chinese is usually out of the question.

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Had my first hit last night with the N11 and 868 albiet on the robot.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Hadn't had a hit for 3 weeks and it showed a bit.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Forehand was very scratchy and I struggled with the light to medium backspin I'd set up.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Backhand however was quite good and if you had seen it you would have though my backhand was my better side, plenty of spin and loop, I was very impressed."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,The forehand just seemed to lack a little something but maybe that something is just a slight adjustment.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Despite being the same rubber, couldn't quite get the same results.Tonight we resume training where I will get to play a few practice games then comp is on Wednesday."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Turns out that due to the level of my selected partner this season, we are in Div 2."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,What this means is that I should go through the season without being challenged except for one person who beat me last season but I rank 100 pts higher and have won our previous four encounters.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,The rest of the players are around 250pts below me.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Due to that I'm not sure it will really give me a good indication of the results of the experiment but during the season I'll play enough of the regular Div 1 players to know how my results, even in practice, compare."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Either way, should be fun."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I think being one of the 'top' dogs in your division is a great opportunity.It gives you a chance to dominate.Work on your 3rd and 5th ball set ups.Get some crazy thick neuro plasticity going on these combinations.When you're up 2-0 in a best of 5, then work on a new tactic."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Even if causes you to lose that game.Then switch back to your winning tactics.This will help build mental toughness as well.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Played some practice matches against the usual div 1 guys I play.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Results very similar but just didn't feel right.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,The set up would be good for more of a flat hitter and it blocked welll but I found the slow spinny loops much harder with less margin for error.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Backhand was OK again but forehand lacked the usual spin or at least it took a lot more effort.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,When I hit it just right it was good but had to be spot on.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Flatter loops/drives were good as was serving with the tacky rubber.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Could anyone use this at a high level, I'm not sure, it does lack some oomph from the rubber so would depend on style however for a club player up to say 1,500 US, it would be fine.On a side note, one of the guys I played who is a bit of a blocker / flat counter attacker who uses an OFF+ with Hexer, laughed when he first tried it and asked if I was serious."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,After about a minute he had already adjusted and played quite well.Sent from my SM-T210 using Tapatalk
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I did for less...
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Is this the CJ8000 or the 868 here?If it's the 868 42° it probably needs a bucketload of boost.

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I've had about 6 weeks, or more than half a Wednesday season, on my M8/Target National/Aurus Soft combo."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Still reasonably satisfied with it.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Good touch on service and topspins with the Target, although I haven't adapted enough to stop netting rather too many smashes – it's more me needing to improve my technique anyway.Earlier this week I set up another M8, this time with Hurricane 3 Neo (nominally a Chinese 39° – which is still hard, feels like easily over German 50°) and Mark V 1.8 on the BH."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The Mark V seems decent, but I'm not a big fan of the H3N so far."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The throw on loops is noticeably flatter than with Target National, and the hard sponge seems to give it less dwell time/feel."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I'll give the new setup a few hours this weekend.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I suspect I'll end up settling on Target National FH/Mark V BH.Edit: the Target National's tack has worn off.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Still grippy.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"OK, I really didn't take to the H3N at all, and switched back to the STN bat after about 45 minutes!"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I know it's mostly a matter of getting used to it, yet I just kept overshooting with my FH loops and couldn't stop thinking how nice it would be to have the STN's fat topspin arc back again."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I didn't find the Mark V to be too much of a departure from Aurus Soft – it feels harder although it retains some suppleness and isn't as brick-like as the H3N; haven't quite figured out how to reliably replicate lifting backspin on BH with the Mark V yet – but the H3N was a lot different from what I like.Another edit: I'd already given the H3N/Mark V combo an hour or so of robot time before group coaching today.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Mostly topspinning against backspin, and some service practice."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I am the opposite, sort of."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Played with T05 for most of the last 8 years.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,For last couple of months have used MX-P. Today I switched back to T05.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,It gives me better margin for error.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I've played a few hours with Mark V 1.8mm on the backhand now, after almost a year with Aurus Soft 1.9mm.It's noticeably less springy."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I have to make a more active stroke to get the ball over the net.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"It's a little off-putting at times to not have the rubber doing as much work for me, but I do want to do this for a few months, for stroke development and more control."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Blocking is easier with Mark V than with Aurus Soft – obviously, opponents differ in how much kick they can put on their loops, but against some people, I feel I could just block reliably all day with Mark V. Unsure about how much different service spin generation is – I like to throw in some backhand swipe serves with heavy sidespin, and my vague feeling is that it takes a little more elbow grease with the Mark V.When I come off Mark V next year, I'll probably go back to Aurus Soft, or maybe back to Victas V-15 Limber, whose soft, slow feel I didn't like before; but which might be a good compromise between the control of Mark V and the relatively greater catapult of Aurus Soft."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Skyline 3-60 Soft is a more aggressive option.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Almost 7 weeks since the last post, I'm still rockin' the 1.8mm Mark V on the backhand."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I keep thinking to myself it's not very exciting and wonder what I'm going to replace it with, yet I keep making the full gamut (well, my limited gamut) of shots with it, from terrible bunting to ridiculously loaded flicks, and I'm really hard-pressed to blame any of the bad ones on the rubber being too fast or unpredictable.And I'm still very happy with the Sanwei Target National on FH."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,And with the Sanwei M8.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Boring, eh?"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Now I've played the equivalent of about one and a half seasons with the STN/M8 setup, with the Mark V on BH for about a season."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Lately I've been struggling.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I feel my BH has no bite and is too slow too often.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"On hot, humid days, maybe through no fault of the rubbers, I can't seem to get consistent attacks going."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"After having more trouble than expected tonight against opponents I'd normally expect to beat easily, I brought out my long-unused (I mean, it's been months!)"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,WSC with FH T05 and BH Aurus Soft for doubles.Holy cow!
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Suddenly my FH attacks (loops and smashes) increased in confidence and reliability, and my BH had that cracking lightning-from-the-fingertips feel again, with real speed and greater accuracy from counter hits and topspins.Now I'm wondering if I should completely revert to that setup."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Huh, I'm going to save you the time and trouble, and just come right out and say I'm a low-rated dilettante.After that refreshing hit with the Tenergy/WSC/tensor bat, I took it to pennant on Wednesday and promptly lost 2-4 to a chopper, with lots of long hitting from me."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"D'oh!As I was playing a junior next, and like most well-trained intermediate juniors, this one likes a fast, attacking game, I brought out the trusty STN/M8/Mark V rig again to slow things down, and won 4-1.It may have helped that it wasn't as hot and humid as on my two previous playing days."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I don't know.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Perhaps I just need to fire the metaphorical magic bullet now and then, to remind myself that it doesn't exist."

26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"That's true, it's just that I felt I had done well on my previous playing day in doubles without an adjustment period – but in hindsight, I play both a smaller range of shots, and fewer shots overall, in doubles, so it would have been better to spend more time adapting.Anyway, odd as it seems, I felt my brief stint back with the faster setup increased or renewed my appreciation for the slower one."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"In the absence of 2.0mm Karis M at the Nexy store, I re-rubbered my main M8 blade with a fresh STN sheet on FH (same as before – I'm going to transfer the used FH sheet to my other M8 blade that has Spinlord Keiler 1.8mm medium pips on BH) and DHS Skyline 3-60 Soft 2.1mm on BH.So this was mainly to try out the Skyline 3-60 Soft."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I put 4 hours into it yesterday.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Still adjusting to it.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,It sounds great on fast impact.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Short game control is really nice.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"But my practice partners seemed to find it fairly easy to return my BH drives and topspins, compared with Aurus Soft 1.9 or even Mark V 1.8."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I'll need to try it in some matches this week.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Maybe it's better as a FH rubber, but that spot is taken…"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Getting more comfortable with the Skyline 3-60 Soft on the backhand after a couple of pennant nights and another 4 hours of practice.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I think I'm giving up a little top-end snap, but the trade-off is that a) BH topspins and put-aways are relatively reliable; and b) impact sounds much harder/more impressive than it really is, because the rubber is so loud."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I think this might be beneficial because of the psych-out factor, but OTOH an opponent might think ""wow, that was a cracking backhand, and I just returned it!"""
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"It is easy to get addicted to the catapult effect of tensor rubbers but to be able to fully control them in actual match play is not always so easy for club players.Last summer in practice and casual play I was having great fun using Xeon Vega Europe and elite on my faster TSP balsa blades but then when league started it was another story as at faster venues the ball would often just fly long on chops, blocks etc.So I switched to much underated Xiom Musa and suddenly keeping the ball in play just became easy and natural."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Definitely a good all-round euro type rubber for taming fast blades and very good value.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,However that temptation to try another sheet of Xiom Vega just won't fully​ go away.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I was also going to suggest Musa as a good change-up from Mk V. Seems quite powerful especially on a balsa blade, from my limited experience.Another interesting BH rubber is DHS Gold Arc III."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Chinese sponge and Japanese topsheet, it's one of the softest DHS rubbers I've tried, and retains a lot of the traditional DHS traits."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Again, not used it a lot, but it does seem to slot between a fast tensor and a slower classic rubber."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,Can be pricey though.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"I picked up some Friendship 802 OX short pips to test out for a potential hardbat pennant competition I was thinking of running.Threw them on my Matsushita pro special blade, and gave them a bit of a hit to see whether they would be suitable for the competition - I didn't want anything that spun too much or wobbled either - just a fairly normal hardbat.Bottom line - I ended up enjoying myself so much playing hardbat that I'm actually using them in preference to my ""normal"" combination bat at the moment!Can't get much more classic than that!"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Still on an all-wood blade, the discontinued BTY Chuan Chih-Yuan, which is a little thinner and faster than the Sanwei M8."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"The bottom part of the CCY blade face tapers noticeably more than my M8 or WSC blades so, unfortunately, if a rubber starts its life on the CCY, I can't use it on one of the other blades later.I had a sheet of T25 on the CCY forehand, but replaced it with Karis M after about a week."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"This is because I put the T25 into a corner of the table on its third day of use, gouging a nice hole in it, as you do with expensive rubbers."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,A strip began peeling off the nearby edge a couple of days after that.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,So now I have Karis M on both sides.Is Karis M anything like Mark V?
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I had Mark V on the M8 for some months.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Bearing in mind that I'm using Karis on a slightly faster blade, and that it's 2.0mm vs the Mark V's 1.8mm – no, I don't find them similar."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,The Karis is a lot quicker and feels harder on impact.
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"On the BH, hitting control is more accurate (for me) than with glue effect rubbers – one thing I immediately liked about it."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"In this respect, and to some extent in passive returns that don't catapult like glue effect rubbers, the Karis is comparable to Mark V, but Karis is a brisk 5K runner to the Mark V's casual round-the-block sweatpants-wearing jogger."
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,"Would a faster grade of Mark V, like HPS, be anything like Karis?"
26,5f6c28634272aba9ab775707,Who's gone back to classic rubbers after Tensors/Tenergy?,I probably won't be finding out for myself.
27,5f6c286a4272aba9ab77570b,Donic Baracuda vs Yasaka Rakza 7/7 soft,"If you want more spin but don't mind less speed, then Rakza7 Soft will give very good spin and touch."
27,5f6c286a4272aba9ab77570b,Donic Baracuda vs Yasaka Rakza 7/7 soft,If you want a balanced spin+speed then Rakza7 is the more All-Round rubber.
27,5f6c286a4272aba9ab77570b,Donic Baracuda vs Yasaka Rakza 7/7 soft,Both rubbers have a decent high-throw but Rakza7 should be a little lower due to the harder sponge.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"SInce the CJ8000 is available with different hardnesses and, actually, up to 3 different top-sheets I'd like to know which one you are using actually?Would you mind telling me the version, if known, and the colour of its sponge?"
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Don't know anything about the Giant Dragon, but the Neo TG2 is part of the Hurricane family of rubbers and these are in general fairly slow."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Certainly slow enough for beginners.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,On the other hand there are many other sheets that would work just as well and cost less.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"There really isn't a need to get 1.8mm sponge, max sponge works great even for beginners these days because the ball is larger than it used to be."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,I'd think pretty much any Chinese rubber would work and not be too fast.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"CJ8000 isn't particularly slow, either.Iskandar"
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Got the sheet from a friend.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Rubber only tells me CJ8000, sponge is light purple."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,In case you can't figure out which CJ8000 you have..
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"I compiled photos of all the CJ8000 packets I could find here:viewtopic.php?f=44&t=26303#p329341(This assumes you didn't get them already attached to your blade..)I've actually own pretty much all of them, and have tried most.. and can say it makes little to no practical difference..  Iskandar"
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Is one of them significantly harder then the others?
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Yes, they are."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"You probably have the purple/lavender/mauve or whatever you'd like to call it, which is 36-38° as it is used with the 2-side-loop version and on the softer biotech CJ8000.You can crank the hardness up up to 42-44° by just buying the related version but I recommend to try no harder than 40-42° first."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,And you also could obtain a CJ8000 topsheet and combine it with any other sponge you may like.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Yours should be the B-type topsheet but the C-type, as it is used on the Light&Fast-version, may suit you as well.There's also a tensor-version and versions with japanese sponges but they may feel even softer than your 36-38° sponge."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Found the CJ8000 Speed with 43 deg sponge.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Sounds really good to me:-)
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,What I would suggest is - buy two different ones.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Get the hardest one, and the softest one."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Mount them both on the same blade, see if 1) you can actually tell the difference, and 2) if it MAKES any difference."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"You probably WILL be able to TELL the difference, but it won't MAKE any difference unless you're a very high level player."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"You'll probably PREFER one over the other just by the way they feel, though."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Then get another two from in between, and repeat!"
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"If you're messing with CJ8000, you'll probably find yourself dealing with the ""dish"" problem."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Be patient getting the rubber onto the blade.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Might be pain in extreme cases, I remember getting an actual crease in the topsheet once."

28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Ordered a Neo Skyline 2 today.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,I'm looking forward how it will work...
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Why don't you try it first and check if your theory does match reality?
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"CJ8000 in 36-38° vs 45-47°, you can't have such a numb hand."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Don't remember if I've tried the 45-47 degree but I'm pretty sure I got to 42-43 degrees at least.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"And I went with the softest ZAP (what was it, 32 degrees?)."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Yeah, I could tell one was softer than the other but when it came to actual playing it didn't make much difference."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"I even played with each for a while, until the next thing came along to try."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,I did a lot of mounting two different rubbers on the same blade (including Tensors) and I had to stop and THINK about what I was feeling and what was happening.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,I've got a Tupperware full of half-used rubber to show for it.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Blades are another story, no real need to stop and think about differences, they're VERY obvious."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Iskandar
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Yesterday my Neo Skyline 2 arrived.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,And was surpised that it is vacuum bagged.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Now I read that it is factory tuned and some people say that this effect last just 4 weeks.What to do if the effect ends?a) Just keep playing with the rubber?b) Working with boosters?
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,But: What booster is recommended for Neo Skyline 2?
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Found (at least) two which I could get easily: Falco long and Maximizer.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Some say that Haifu Seamoon suits best, but it is hard to get and very expensive.c) any other suggestion?"
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,All the neo rubbers are factory tuned and come in vacuum packs.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,I would ignore it.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Just play with the rubber.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Boosting (aside from whether or not you have ethical issues) is a ball ache you can really do without.

28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"You could try the ""P.O.""."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Seriously, as LordCope says, I think you can just ignore it, you probably won't notice a difference since the effect fades away slowly rather than all at once."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"The ""2"" Hurricane rubbers are a little slower than the ""3"" (since they were designed for the old 38mm ball, or so I've read), so it's going to be a fairly slow rubber to begin with."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Iskandar
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Yes, just play with it."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"The boosting effect is quite mild, and it loses a little over time, which you'll probably hardly notice and it stays perfectly playable."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Many other rubbers are boosted too, and people get a lot more than 4 weeks out of it, so don't worry about it."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Yep, just play it."

28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,DHS TG2 Skyline Neo rubbers are a bit heavy and maybe a little too hard and fast for a beginner ?
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Also the ""factory-tuning"" doesn't really do anything spectacular either."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,The P.O.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,treatment should be on the bare sponge (without any glue applied yet) and left alone for 2 - 3 days.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"If you want just leave the rubber out for 1 - 2 weeks after PO and there will be no effect other than a very much softer sponge and the rubber should play ""normal"" like as after breaking-in the rubber so that it is tamed."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,I have used TG2 Neo lots and I can say that for first 1 - 2 weeks of play it will feel like the ball always lands on the white line and after the 2 weeks the rubber calms down.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,So you need to give the rubber lots of time and yourself more practice playing with it.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Also, TG2 Neo topsheet is a very tacky and scuffs like anything."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,So proper extra care to maintain it by using a soft damp sponge to clean after play and protective sheets to prevent dust accumulation is mandatory  Also no rubbing it on your sweaty jersey or pant-legs or towel.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Topsheet will wear out after about 3 - 4 months though it will stay tacky throughout the life of the rubber.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,After 4 months of play it will be just like any Chinese rubber like 729 etc.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,Disclaimer: Im not any kind of pro-player or ranked etc.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,So opinions will differ
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,played the TG2 Neo for the first time yesterday and it felt just great.
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,"Wonder why I didn't tried it earlier.Good control, heavy spin, quick enough if you want.Hope this positive first impression lasts longer."
28,5f6c286e4272aba9ab77570d,Neo Skyline 2 or Giant Dragon Storm for beginner/returner??,But I'm quite optimistic!
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Not sure I understand what you mean.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Could you define your terms?
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"I think I understand thin and thick, as we can measure these empirically."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Are you talking about sponge thickness?
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"As for fast/slow, that's pretty subjective, and is a function of how you play your strokes, the sponge thickness and type, the topsheet, and also the blade.On the whole, I think that many amateur players generally use equipment that is much ""faster"" than they need."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I'll give you a few examples: A strong junior using Tenergy 05 Max on FH & BH on a 7 ply carbon blade.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"I'd say this is generally a ""fast"" setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,His loops and counterloops are blistering.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"However, he can't serve short, and he can't touch short."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I'm pretty sure his serving and touching technique is good.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"When he served with my old coach's 5 ply blade, with H3N, his serves were much much better, and his short game was far more controlled."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Sure his loops weren't as ""fast"" and he needed to put in more effort, but I thought he played better with the less fast setup.I sometimes play weaker players using my hardbat setup - 2 x Dr Evil on a Tibhar Defence Plus."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Now this is probably about the slowest setup I have ever felt.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"To get the ball full length on a FH or BH drive, I need to exert much more energy than with my usual setup (1.8mm short pips on an OFF blade)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"However, within about five minutes, my brain/body has corrected its expectations, and I can play the balls short or long, with plenty of control."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"When I need to hit the ball hard and fast, I can."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If there's a weak ball and I smash it, it goes very hard and very fast."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"This is with no sponge, on one of the slowest blades on the planet."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I don't lack penetration - I just need to place the ball well and get the timing right.My team mate is a top division two player.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Probably good enough for division one.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"He has superb control on his FH and BH, and can roll and place the ball accurately."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Against even slightly high balls, his FH is explosive, yet accurate."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"He hits the ball very very hard indeed, with masses of spin, and can hit through most defenders at this level."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If you watch him playing, you might think he has a very fast setup indeed."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Nope he uses an all wood, ALL+ blade, and 2.0mm Sriver on both sides.What's my point?"
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"There's a lot of gibberish spoken about ""fast"" and ""slow""."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Clearly there are measurable and experienceable differences, but on the whole an amateur player can do pretty much anything with pretty much any setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"In general, faster setups should probably be eschewed until a player can demonstrate control and mastery of all their strokes with an allround setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I'm not sure that I do understand the question correctly.Do you ask for the advantages/disadvantages between going for faster rubbers but thinner sponges compared to softer or slower rubbers with unchanged or thicker sponge viewed from a certain starting point?
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Usually thin (sponge) means less speed, so I wonder what you're asking about."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Same with blades - thin blades are usually slower than thick ones.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Iskandar
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"IMO Speed is less of a consideration as there are a lot of slower thick blades (309 chop, defensive balsa), and plenty of of slower thick rubbers (Reflectoid, tack chop, etc)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Also plenty of fast thinner blades (Carbon) and thinner fast-ish rubbers (Yanus, thin Yasaka Mark V HPS, thin, tenergy, thin Vega Asia)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"The thicker you go with Reflectoid/P-4/Tack chop/FL3, the SLOWER and more dampening they become."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"To answer the OP's question, it's mostly about feel and preference."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Some of the thicker blades just feel different, depending on the type of material they use."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,It also causes stiffness and the amount vibes are change.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Weight could also be a difference, but that largely depends on the type of wood.Thin vs."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thick rubbers.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thickness/Thiness gives you consistency for very specific shots.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Thinness on the same rubber usually gives you less grip, and particularly for chopping it makes dealing sidespin loops more managable (this goes for both pips and inverted)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thinner rubbers are also easier to flick with because of the same spin-insensitivity.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Generally, the thinner the rubber, the more spin-insensitive it is (always comparing to the same rubber but different thicknesses).Thickness gives you conistency of throw angle when you block/drive/smash, and ensures that you rarely bottom out your rubber which will always (and suddenly) change your throw angle."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thicker rubbers also give more mechanical grip as they tend to envelop the ball and thus more surface area is in contact.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"So if you wish to generate more spin with your bat movement, thicker is generally how you do it."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"The feel is also different, so people who have styles that rely on touch and not power so much often prefer thinner rubbers for more feeling."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If you are all power all day, thicker is generally the preference."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Sorry for the vague question.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,An extreme example of what I meant would be 1.5mm Tenergy (I know this doesn't exist) vs. Mark V max.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Sponge accounts for a significant portion of the bat's weight, so I guess the thinner sponged rubber would yield a lighter setup."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,This would be at the expense of spin capability on high impact shots.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If you have a weak wrist and a fast loop is not in your repertoire, thin sponge on a fast rubber might be your cup of tea, if you can find it."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Most likely, you'd lose more than you gain."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"I knew exactly what you were asking, and that's what I was responding to."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I am actually looking for a fast-ish thin rubber for Classic Chopping on the FH.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I think you would have the advantages of a thinner rubber (insensitive to sidespin) but a little more speed to help get the ball back without too much forward motion.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"If there is decent grip and/or tack to the topsheet, then service should be fine."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,that largely depends on the type of wood.จีคลับเข้าไม่ได้
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"And yet another alternative, thick and fast on a slower blade.In any case, to answer the actual question asked, I would argue that thicker is better for offensive minded players."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,The feel is better.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,I would also suggest perhaps something a bit harder.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Thick sponge is necessity for power loop with both speed and spin.Choppers prefer thinner sponge for maximum underspin.The overal rubber speed is less important.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Well, I can tell you very thick, very slow rubber is pretty disappointing."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"My first custom racket had Tackiness Chop 2.0mm on it (this was back in the day of the 38mm ball, 2.0mm was considered quite thick, beginners started with 1.5mm)."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Way too slow for any kind of attacking game.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Iskandar
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,It would require very good technique.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,But i have seen people attack with it very effectively.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,"Honestly, you can adapt to anything."
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,Even I can attack with 1.0mm Reflectoid.
29,5f6c28834272aba9ab77571b,Thin / Fast vs. Thick / Slow,That is about as non-offensive as you can get.

31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,Did you check the tabletennis-database?
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"From the 2 rubbers given I would go with Tibhar, but that is hardly a recommendation."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"Near/on table you probably could also use a harder rubber, even chinese, imho."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,What other rubbers do you have played so far?
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"Hi Red,I played for two years about ten years ago and used sticky Chinese rubbers as they were easy to spin and offered reasonable control in the thin sponges I used."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,Trouble was I had a strong backhand but a poor forehand and so found myself playing mainly defensive relying on chop and spin.Have decided to get back into the table tennis to keep fit and agile and so want to up my game and have been working a lot on my forehand to get it up level with my BH.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"Only been back playing for the last 5 months and took the decision to try some none sticky rubbers with maybe a bit more speed but still need to feel in control.I was given some rubbers to try by someone which includedTenergy 05 - way too fast for me and hard to control.MX-P - too fast, too springy but good spin.FX- P - quite liked this rubber."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,Found it great for most aspects but still a little too fast.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,Many shots going off the end of the table.Joola energy 325 soft - using this now and have to say I like it in all aspects but have found I just clip the top of the net with alarming regularity.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,This had never been a problem within my game before but for some reason it has been since using this.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,Otherwise I love the feeling of the soft sponge.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"Control is up another notch and blocking and pushing are nice and easy.Am I right in thinking that a rubber with a higher throw angle would help with this or would it put me back to the original problem of over hitting the table.Obviously practice, practice and more practice will improve most points within the game which I feel are improving all the time but I still keep clipping the top of the net way too often."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,I somehow wouldn't make the described behaviour dependant on throw.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"What for a blade did you use (I may have overlooked it here) because that could be the decisive factor here.I'd like you to check KTL (LKT) Pro XP and maybe a softer, more flexible blade before spending too much on an xtra-advanced rubber.Sounds like you've had one of these heavy china-concrete rubbers back then..."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,Whats your take on tacky rubbers on fh?
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,fast rubbers like t-05 and mxp kinda hinders progression of individual technique and too reliant on the rubbers itself providing you energy vs you swinging properly to make a good play.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,E.g a small flick of wrist would propels the ball in a forgiving manner on t-05 vs say hurricane 3.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"If u hate tacky rubbers, I'd recommend the usual thing I'd recommend my friends, rakza 7, xiom vega pro ( I myself am getting vega asia soon) , personally haven't tried andro, and the thibar I've tried like MXP is top notch but maybe a tad too fast for my level on my blades right now.The relation to high throw and high control differs from individual, but to me if i were to give comparison of it, t05 vs mxp, on loops with big arm swings t05 goes higher and easier to consistently hit the opponent's side of table, while mxp has a lower and acute angle and travels further needs quite a good precision when using it, bear in mind both rubbers ive tried were on diff blades and both all wood."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"All in all , don't delve too much on what rubbers you use, each have small intricacies that cater to different players, and small quirks that some players like some doesn't, but with good training, given time you can eliminate all the factors ( throw angle, speed etc) of the rubbers and make it work for your game."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,I use a Tibhar defense plus.I like the control and the fact that its not too fast and not too heavy.I simply find the trajectory on my backhand rather flat and direct which results in only just clipping the net yet I have never had this issue with any of the previous rubbers.Thought maybe this would be to do with the throw angle being lower than the other rubbers.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,I've always wondered what the thing behind Rasant Beat was.
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"Is it just a softer, slower Rasant?"
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"Be aware that all these German rubbers are OEM'ed in the same factory by the same company, there's probably only six or so basic rubbers, and they tweak them a little bit to get the differences."
31,5f6c28af4272aba9ab775739,5Q sound or Andro rasant beat,"There's probably exact clones of any given rubber in some other brand, there's only so many variations you can have."

32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,"For me it's thicker, since I hit much harder through the balls on forehand compared to backhand, and I don't want the rubber to bottom out."
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,"If you go softer, you might need to go thicker, or the rubber will bottom out earlier."
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,"Bottoming out is not necessarily bad of course... if you're hitting/smashing the ball then it becomes easier if the rubber bottoms out, as you tend to get more speed and it's less sensitive to incoming spin."

32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,It's a simple question.
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,The option to specifiy same thickness should have been included but it was based on my own experiences.
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,Where would I draw the line in options though.
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,Same thickness but different hardness.
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,Same thickness.
32,5f6c28b84272aba9ab77573f,Thicker sponge on forehand or backhand?,Can't add it now as it will delete all answers given todate.I've always associated forehand with power and backhand with control.

33,5f6c28c14272aba9ab775744,spinny Euro/Japan rubbers & non-tacky Chinese rubber,There might be but I've not noticed.
33,5f6c28c14272aba9ab775744,spinny Euro/Japan rubbers & non-tacky Chinese rubber,"Other similar rubbers to this are apparently Andro Hexer and I think Tibhar Genius.Personally I don't think you can compare LKT XP Pro to Baracuda, not to say you can't play as good but they are not similar rubbers although are both non-tacky."
33,5f6c28c14272aba9ab775744,spinny Euro/Japan rubbers & non-tacky Chinese rubber,Baracuda is faster and spinnier.
33,5f6c28c14272aba9ab775744,spinny Euro/Japan rubbers & non-tacky Chinese rubber,If you can't tell a difference then I'd just go with Iskandar's theory and just get any reasonable Chinese rubbers as the differences are subtle.
33,5f6c28c14272aba9ab775744,spinny Euro/Japan rubbers & non-tacky Chinese rubber,729 Battle is faster then Baracuda.

34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Very spinny chops that are decently easy for me to control.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,"I've tried chopping with slower blades, but after having played fast blades for a good long while, the defensive ones always feel mushy to me and I actually chop worse with them."
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Well in my country there's no proper measurement like USATT.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Although my coach is a professional player who played the world cup (division 4) and I can't beat him obviously but recently I can get some good rallies going and sometimes also win games.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Yeah the best long pimple player of our country uses a Mazunov Off+ lol.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I could also chop with an Off blade.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,But I get so much more control with a defensive blade.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Haha where's Joo and where's me
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Hi mate I have used most tenergys.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,The 05 fx has a softer sponge than the 05 so the 05 is a bit harder.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,So both would work with chops and looping....It's just depends what feel you would prefer...
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I have found that the tenergy 80 feels a bit softer than the 05..
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I prefer the feel of the 80.. You could definitely chop and loop with this one no problem at all..
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,It's also fantastic as a back hand rubber.. other people that have used my bat that has 05 on one side and 80 on the other prefer the feel of the 80.. Hope this helps..ask me more if you want .

34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I'm curious to know what they're like for that sort of stuff.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,TO5 is great for fishing/guiding stroke.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,"Long dwell time, good grip and outstanding spin, especially sidespin is good."
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,"So it's reliable, controlled and effective."
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,"I don't like T64 that much, as it's too bouncy and fast for my taste."

34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I'm currently using Tibhar Aurus Soft for chopping/looping.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,The counterspin is a little slow for my slow blade.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I guess I'll go with 05 fx/80 because of the softer feel.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,Sorry for the late reply.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I was out of the loop for a while.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I do not think that 05FX is much different from Aurus Soft.
34,5f6c28d14272aba9ab77574c,Tenergy 05 fx for chopping/looping,I suggest to try original 05 if you want something different.

37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,I've only seen this happen with really over-boosted sheets (where it curls up into a burrito).
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"Not really sure what is happening but I suspect it's the rubber sheet rolling up in the direction of least resistance, rather than asymmetric/unidirectional expansion."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,Iskandar
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"As I said: ""Whatever"" happens to ""the topsheet"", it happens *more in one direction than in another*."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,Probably has to do with the alignment of the pips.
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,Think e.g.
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"Sriver L vs Sriver S - the pips align differently (by 90 degrees), so I guess one will dome in one direction (if you'd speed glue it) and the other in the other direction."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"In other words, direction of dome depends on whether pips are in rows or in columns."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"When I've boosted rubbers such that they curl heavily, I've noticed that it's just as easy to get a top/bottom curl if you just nudge it that way; so definitely not like the rubber is only able to bend one way."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"As mentioned above, it's probably pip structure is such that when that a slight dome has a tendency to curl side to side."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"As I've said, you see this usually when you've induced an extreme amount of expansion into the sponge."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"As you note - if you unroll the sheet and ""nudge"" it in the opposite direction you can get it to roll up the other way."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"I think what's happening is that when you have a small amount of sponge expansion, the rubber will dome (in two directions) but if the sponge expansion is greater, it would rather roll up in one direction or the other because this relieves the most amount of stress."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"If the sponge has expanded so much it causes the rubber to roll up like a burrito, the burrito is incapable (due to the extreme curl) of curling in the other direction."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"I can't ever recall seeing a rubber ""burrito"" in the old days of VOC speed glue - the domes could be fairly radical, but the rubber would never get to the point you can achieve with modern boosters."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"In the old days the rubber would be forced onto the blade in the domed condition, these days we wait for the dome to subside or the rubber won't stick."
37,5f6c293a4272aba9ab77577f,Asymmetrical dish/dome: Ever thought about it?,"There are probably some people here wondering what a ""burrito"" is... have they made it to Australia yet?"

38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,I think just about any soft sponged Tensor will give you this feel.
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,"Pick the softest one fro each brand, and it will feel like that... not exactly the same, but similar."
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,I always find soft Tensors very good and forgiving for hitting.
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,Best one I can recommend is genius+ optimum sound which is light soft and lively.
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,Unfortunately it will be discontinued soon.
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,"Other options may be tibhar 5q, rhyzm 375, Acuda s3, bluefire m3.Another option may be cornilleau pilot power which is even lighter than the genius, has high catapult but produces basically zero spin."

38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,"And Vega Europe.The sponge is harder with the first 2, but since they are tensors with tall pips feel soft."
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,Vega Europe has both soft sponge and tall pips.
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,Europe is the best blocker and the Asias have the better chop and loop.
38,5f6c293c4272aba9ab775780,Soft/Lively Rubbers?,But they all play very well.

39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,I don't think he could go far wrong with a sheet of something like Mark V 1.8mm or a similar classic rubber.
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,"It's considerably faster than Tackiness Chop, but in 1.8mm the control would be very good."
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,"Tackiness Drive is a bit faster than the Tackiness Chop, but still works nicely for chopping."
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,"I have also tried Kokutaku BLütenkirsche 868 a bit and it seems similar to the Tackiness rubbers for many strokes, but with less grip on the thinnest brush strokes."
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,"Not ideal for slow loops or very spinny serves, but excellent for chop and drive."
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,The sponge on the Kokutaku also feels a bit firmer than the Tackiness sponges.
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,Globe 999 with a softer sponge form ColesTT should work
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,Another one to consider is Joola Topspin Chopper.
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,This rubber offers the best of both worlds in topspin and chop and has decent speed (faster than tackiness drive) when when topspinning.
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,Tackiness Drive will do the trick.
39,5f6c29474272aba9ab775789,Chopping / topspin rubber,I find Joola Topspin C a bit lacking in the push department.

40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,With the former I can brush very hard yet the ball travels slowly.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"---Now I'll answer your question ""Why there is no sponge that can give the same performance as traditional chinese hard sponges + booster/glue?"
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,""":(Usually), booster/tuning is applied to the blade side of the sponge and then begins leaking, from there, into and through the sponge and then out into the air.So, the boosting/tuning is stronger and remains stronger nearer the blade, and is weaker (and then gets even weaker) on the topsheet side, where the booster/tuner leaks out.If the sponge is hard, and if the topsheet side of the sponge is *relatively* unboosted/untuned, then the gap (as described above) between topsheet mode and sponge mode would be preserved to some extent for the sake of the short game, while a harder hit would engage the more boosted/tuned sponge farther down."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,If the sponge isn't hard enough this gap is lost.Why doesn't Butterfly make a hard-enough (in this context) Spin Art?
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,Surely Butterfly did try a harder Spin Art.

40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,is equal) then the slower the booster/tuner leaks out.

40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,*That* is useful in the short game.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,Someone who has a very good short game and can use this extra spin and still keep the ball short with a boosted rubber would probably want this extra spin.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"I'm not that good and Hurricane/Skyline is already very spinny.-Next, yes, if boosting softens the sponge and makes it faster it would reduce that ""gap"", and the sponge would begin adding speed to serves and pushes.Hurricane 3 has a good gap."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,The amount of boosting/tuning in H3NEO is not too much.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"It is still a great Chinese-style rubber (that's why I included it in the first group, in my previous post)."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"But many people who use a lot more booster/tuner than that do not really like the 1-3 behavior that I described, I think."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"They say about unboosted H3 that ""it doesn't have a low gear"" or ""on soft hits the ball falls into the net"", and things like that."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"I think they don't understand that 1-3 model, and they don't actually like it."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"I loved it even before I had thought it all through, before I realized what was happening."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,I don't want the extra speed and I don't want the properties of my rubber to change too much as any booster/tuner wears off.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,It can feel great to play with a more lively rubber!
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"But then it is depressing when the tuning wears off and the setup is more inert again, and I don't want to get involved in that cycle.Also, I just spent a couple of years looking toward a partly defensive style, and I still hope to push and chop with as much control as possible."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,I looked at rubbers like Tackiness Chop for a while but did want more speed.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,I think it is very interesting that the rubbers we're talking about can also serve for this.No.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"But when I play over the net, inside the table, I want to ""cut"" the ball as hard as I can and still drop it short (and I'm not a great player who can do that with a faster rubber)."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,The price I pay is that when I am hitting hard I must work a lot harder.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,If I were a better player and a lot more of my shots were hard I could imagine welcoming the added speed.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"No, my fault.."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"I didn't get what he was saying - I'd written a long post asking about it, and finally figured out what he was saying after I'd posted it.."
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,Your post is completely understandable - and explains a lot about why people use Hurricane.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"If there was a way to delete posts here, I would have done so."

40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"Wow, thank you for your post iskandar taib!"
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"Now it's a pretty good thread, eh?"
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,I knew I wasn't the first.
40,5f6c29504272aba9ab77578e,Tacky rubbers and booster/factory tuning/glueing,"Here is a probably more credible poster who said the same thing as the ""1, 2, 3"" in my post of 27OCT15, above:viewtopic.php?f=44&t=25756#p274081"

42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,  similar impressions with LKT Pro XT ( not P) black on 1.0 mm.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,HRS sponge .
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Blade is Nittaku Resist, willow outer ply."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Surprisingly spinny...Slow and very heavy chop...Great for classical def.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Nice review Japsican!
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Sounds like you're onto a winner for you.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"The LKT topsheet is also quite thin and elastic, which accounts for some of the properties you describe."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,I forgot to mention that the testing was done on a Defplay Senso.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Mostly forehand, but I twiddle a lot, so backhand usage also colors my analysis."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Here is the WRM video I spoke of above.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"They are using a 1.5mm Galaxy Sun Pro, and demonstrate the ease of flicking."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"With the LKT pro, it's similar to this for flicking."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"I have the Pro XP for my backhand - red 1.8mm, normal sponge."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,One word - awesome.It doesn't feel that tacky and it is somewhere between soft and medium.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Quite light but not feather light.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Seems quite durable too.It has a bit of bounce but not a catapult like effect.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Definitely worth trying if you want a good backhand rubber for about US$10-14.I find it really fun doing flicks, pushes, backhand loops, drives and over-the-table blocks."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Yeah, basically everything."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,It reminds me of Donic Coppa but a tad softer.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Jap, nice review!"
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,What's the difference between fishing and a guide loop?
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Thanks!
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"I differentiate between the two in my head, but I could totally be wrong about how I interpret the two strokes."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"There is certainly some overlap between them.To me, fishing is done usually with an open bat where the rubber is pointed more toward the ceiling."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,This is used more with balls that are falling more vertically before making contact with the bat.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Example would be when you are chopping at distance and your oppnonent does a soft drop shot and you have to run in and fish the ball near the table.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Fishing is done more when out of position.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,Typically the ball is recieved below the knees.A Guide loop is done when the ball has more topspin and more speed.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,The bat is more closed and facing the opponent more...from 45 to 80 degrees.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,The ball is typically recieved above the knees.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,These balls are sent back with much more pace and much more topspin.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Often, modern defenders will add some side spin on these shots to deal with the topspin from the loops."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,If you watch the Koji Matsushita tutorial video where he is teaching Shiono and someone else (cant remember the name) he shows this shot.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,I'll look up the video.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Gionis and Filus do this as their regular stroke from distance while playing defense, so any video you see of them when they aren't attacking on the FH, 90% of the time the stroke on the FH is what I consider to be a ""Guide Loop."""
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Here's an example of Filus doing what I call a ""guide loop"" in a game with Gustaf Ericson:It's at 1:27, the below link should start playing at that stroke.http://rowvid.com/?v=iHNeTY1-4uw&t=86.16&s=1"
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Here, Gionis does it at the 6 second mark right in the first rally."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,He also does it at 2:18:
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"For me the ""big"" difference between looping and fishing is swing."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Fishing is done with minimal swing, often a as a wristy shot - typically using opponents top spin to power the shot back."
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,I often just get the blade on the ball when ball is going down and maybe I have time for some wrist move.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,I call that fishing.
42,5f6c297e4272aba9ab7757ac,LKT Pro XP/1.2mm Air Supersoft Sponge - Inverted Chopping,"Or when someone just gives soft top spin and I wait it to drop and I guide it back with wristy stroke or with very short arm movement.Loop with slow moving arm and body rotation could be called ""guide loop"", as with slow rotation you forced to read the spin well and guide the ball carefully instead of just ""blindly"" ripping the ball."

43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Donic Acuda p rubbers I think.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Do you mean the new Acuda Blue series?I heard something about the Tibhar Genius that are supposed to be relatively light.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Can anyone confirm this?
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Tibhar genius is indeed light.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Tibhar genius sound is even lighter i think.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,"Perhaps that's one options, although I don't know how close it is in performance... there are always trade-offs."
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,tibhar genius sound (compared to for exemple andro rasant) :-lighter-softer-slower-higher arc topspin-not as good to block and flat hit-more feelingI combined genius sound with a blade that compensates for its weaknesses (flat hitting and blocking) and it played great on FH.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,"You can generate speed when you need it, with your own power and the high arc gives a lot of net safety."
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,The light weight makes it easy to flick and add some extra spin with the wrist.Xiom vega Elite is also light weight and i like it on BH.Currently trying chinese tacky slow (but heavy) rubber on FH (three nine super 999T) and I like it aswell.All these setups on andro temper tech off-
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Stiga Magna TC II - Old generation rubber that transformed a Stiga Allround Classic that had Mendo energy rubbers.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Works beautifully on a blaðe with a little flex.Donic Coppa X1 - high performing light weight rubber but low throw.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Used on the BH.Calibra LT still a performance rubber and does not have the weight penalty of the new generation.Omega V Tour - possibly the lightest of the new generation rubbers comparable with the weight of a Tenergy 05.Adidas Tenzone ultra SF - resonable weight & very dynamic.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Can be used on both FH & BH.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Hopefully it will continue under a difference name.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Great topic.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,I have gone back to double inverted and swinging a heavy bat is killing me!
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,"Not a tensor but KTL Green Dragon is very, very light (the one I have was 47 grams uncut.. with max sponge!)."
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,"A little slow, but you can always fix that with Seamoon...  Iskandar"
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Calibra LT is light.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Great speed.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Short on spin.
43,5f6c29804272aba9ab7757ad,Lighter Tensors / current generation glue effect rubbers,Designed for mid-court play.Supposedly it is a Japanese rubber.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Sounds interesting with the sponge consisting of a soft and a hard layer.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Golden Star is on the new ITTF list...
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I had never even noticed it.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,pretty pricey for lkt/ktl rubbers!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,yowsa
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Wow i didn't even notice the price!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,That puts me off for a Chinese rubber...they would have to prove their quality and quality control before charging that sort of money IMO...
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,im prety sure the dual sponge idea will entice enough people to buy it
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,You're probably right.... but I have my doubts that it will do anything special.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I'm also concerned that once the ITTF get hold of the idea, they may well ""find"" a rule against it."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I just stumbled across an ad about this rubber on a TT magazine.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It was a full page ad!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I guess Mr. Li Kuang Tsu will have to make some money on the Golden Star to pay for the ad  I have a 729 Bomb and LKT Red Diamond (Golden Cake Sponge) sitting around waiting for another rubber.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Let me give Mr. Li's office a call to see what is the selling price on this new rubber.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I will bite if it is less than USD25.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Will report back about the price.Just a side note, anyone tried 729 Bomb with LKT Red Diamond (first gen or Golden Cake Sponge)?"
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The third gen of Red Diamond has been out for a while but it is a grippy rubber instead of a tacky one.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,what exactly do they mean by a hard and soft layer sponge?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,?I suppose we'd just be speculating at this point?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,One side of the sponge is firmer than the other.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,IIRC the loop variety has the firm side of the sponge against the blade and the softer side against the topsheet.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Eacheng lists both rubbers and details the sponge configuration.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"yeah I read the description but I was kind of wondering what that really meant... like if it was a 2 part sponge (which I wouldn't have guessed would be legal), or how exactly they could accomplish that within 1 sponge"
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I posted this on MYTT, but I thought I would post it here also."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The process to turn multiple rubber layers into a single layer apparently has a patent.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I haven't seen this rubber process used anywhere else.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Here is the patent description:""The invention discloses a process for manufacturing single-layer sponge rubber for a table tennis bat with polytropic comprehensive effects, which is provided with a milling device, rolling devices, a cutting device and a vulcanizing device, and is characterized by comprising the following steps: milling more than two mixed rubbers with different formulations; rolling the mixed rubbers with the different formulations into sheet prefabricated products in more than two rolling devices; stacking more than two sheets of the prefabricated products together; pressing the stacked prefabricated products, and expelling interlayer air to make the prefabricated products contacted more tightly; cutting the pressed prefabricated products into a plurality of units with proper size; and vulcanizing the cut prefabricated product units in a die to obtain the sponge rubber for the table tennis bat with a single-layer structure."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"The process avoids the phenomenon such as hard film delamination generated when the prior sponge rubbers with different properties are stacked and adhered by adhesive, and simultaneously can provide the sponge rubber more suitable for self playing mode for athletes according to the requirements of the athletes so as to fully exert individual technical merits."""
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"yeah I was actually just reading that from the link you provided at myttso indeed, it seems that it's 2 sponges merged, no?"
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I think this is the key phrase which appears at the beginning of the patent description:""The invention discloses a process for manufacturing single-layer sponge rubber for a table tennis bat with polytropic comprehensive effects""So, they are creating a single-layer sponge by merging multiple layers of sheets so as to create different effects."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"The exact title of the patent is:""Manufacturing process of mono-layer many-party comprehensive table tennis bat blown sponge""The are calling it ""many-party"" but ""mono-layer""."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"@richrf, thanks for the patent description."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I feel a bit loss after reading it I hope this new technology actually works as advertised, but I won't hold my breath for it."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"If the price is reasonable, EJers will try."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Otherwise, it will be forgotten soon."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,My guess is that it is different but not necessarily better.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,There is a forum member over at MYTT who has ordered a sheet.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Hopefully we will get a review.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Ultimately, it is the quality of the top sheet and the sponge that counts."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,KTL is asking for an above average price for a sheet.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Eacheng has it for $32 USD.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,That is mid-range between the cheap Chinese and the more expensive Tensors.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"If it has decent spin, speed, and durability and has a consistent manufacturing process then I think it has a niche."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I'm personally looking for something that is priced in that range that has good durability and performance characteristics.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Your price point comment is well taken.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"However, if LKT is pricing its newest rubber like what they have priced others for the local market, I expect local price to be around USD25 -28."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I hope my guess is right.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,USD32 will get me a Hexer+ or Barracuda with change; these are proven good rubbers.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Called KTL about the price of Golden Star, the guy on the phone only gave me a indicative price...it looks like it's around USD20, give or take."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It is a reasonable price for EJers (that would include ME) to try out.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Is this the price in China?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I''m in the U.S. Where is the best place to buy it?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Thanks.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It's office-walk-in price.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I bought my TT stuff at brick-n-mortar stores locally or in China.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Last time I browsed ttnpp site and found prices there are generally good, except there are some compliants on service quality (to be fair though, there were happy buyers)."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Can find no customer feedbacks in English about the rubber so far.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Are there some reviews in Chinese?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Thanks.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I haven' t seen any Chinese review yet.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"As far as I can tell, the Chinese TT community is not too crazy about LKT/KTL rubbers."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"KTL / LKT is from Hong Kong, and as such it's often not easily available in the rest of China... not sure why..."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It's available at some fairly large sporting goods websites.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I think the the reason is that there are way too many rubbers to choose from in China.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,LTK has broken the barriers to the mainland China market.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,And the pricing of rubbers is very competitive there.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"my personal opinion is that they messed up by making two hardnesses...they should have made a multitude of them...and by that i mean they should have made the hardness of the sponge increase gradually instead of being soft and then all of a sudden hard....i feel this rubber is going to have the ""thors"" effect....if any previous users know what i am talking about...."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I got so used to the Thor's effect I couldn't use the updated ""fixed"" version :~!"
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Please don't take it as if I am trying to defend the idea and technology in the making of Golden Star.Based on the the product info, it more like hard on the outer part of the sponge, then it becomes softer where the sponge is closer to the blade."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I thought I would point this out to clear any confusion.Let's just assume Golden Star is made so that its playability is similar to Thors.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"At least true for locally, and perhaps in greater China, Golden Star will be sucesssful in terms of price competitiveness."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Based on indicative price of GS, it is being sold at 2/3 of Thors' local selling price.Personally, I think LKT is trying to make a rubber with sponge that behaves like a Chinese rubber when the player is trying to loop, and behaves like a Euro/Japanese rubber for attack, push, block, etc."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I am most interested to see what kind of top sheet GS has.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Is it like the Chinese kind of hard, like DHS's Hurr of TG."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Or will be like Tenergys and Tensors.I have got to make a trip to their office to get one!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Have anybody tested KTL GS rubber by now???
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,is the sheet heafty or light weighed?Thanks
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,deffinately ordering the two different ones next time i shop which is kinda soon
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Here is a closeup of the sponge...coutesy of igorponger  ... appearantly from a dealer in HK... looks cool!Anyone tried it yet?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,the top sheet looks similar to hurricane 3(provincial) from the side
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Finally got around to visit LKT's office last week...spent HKD240 (around USD30) on a sheet of Golden Star (It is more than what a LKT employee had quoted to me previously, there must be some misunderstanding."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I bought it anyway since I was there).Golden Star comes in two variants: Fast Attack and Spin.The first impressions of the Fast Attack version (ITTF no.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"110-004) are:Top sheet seems to be of good quality (it is grippy with slight tackiness...more tacky than, say, Xiom Vega Asia)Sponge seems to be quite porous (give the current trend of sponges...no surprise there)The rubber seems to be heavier than previous LTK rubbers (I compare it to a sheet of uncut Red Diamond Golden Cake Sponge)The price of Golden Star matches or exceeds the price of some Tensors, therefore, I am expecting it to deliver a relatively good performance."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I'll keep my fingers crossed.I have a new 729 Bomb I want to try.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I am still considering if Bomb and Golden Star (on FH) is a good match.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I am thinking of putting the Red Diamond Golden Cake Sponge on BH.What do you think?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,i wouldnt try red diamond how about normal or blue sponged H3 play with that and the KTL then swap the H3 for something more euro/jap style.. that would bea good comparison .
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,if you can
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I've been using a Golden Star - Loop for the past week.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Just robot time, but have a practice night tonight."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I was posting impressions over at myTT, but their database has exploded so I can't post anything useful there yet.Just to warn you - I took GS-L off an OSP Expert and moved it to a Calix."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"When taking the rubber off, a chunk of the lower sponge came away."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The bond between the sponge and blade seemed stronger than the bond between the sponge layers.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Be super careful when removing!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"When peeling back, perhaps use a thin knife to slide under the lower sponge to help seperate from the blade.About Red Diamond - if you want to try it for the BH, go for the new KTL version, not the older LKT one."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Supposed to have a lot of potential as a backhand rubber.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I have one on order (and a new KTL Black Power as well).
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"The old LKT ones were tacky, and better for forehand IMO."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Thanks AndySmith!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Please post your impressions after practice... that's always a lot better than robot practice.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,@decoy - Thanks for bringing up trying GS together with Euro rubbers for a better read on how GS stacks up against competitions.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Currently, Tensors are my favorites."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,@AndySmith - Thanks for the heads up on reglueing of GS.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Luckily, I don't plan to reglue my sheet of GS any time soon."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"When I do, I'll make sure I remember what you said.Note to self: Got to find time to glue the GS or else it will like the Red Diamond...sitting idle."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I am having so much fun with my newly adopted Yasaka Hasha at the moment.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Used it last night in a match situation (I had forgotten about this match - was expecting a practice night).
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"During the warm-up with teammates, I had a lot of comments about the spin I was generating."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I wasn't putting a huge amount of effort in.During the match it performed very well.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"It's not outright crazy fast, but more than enough."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The most impressive thing is the ease of access to spin.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Slow, medium effort loops had a lot more spin on than I expected."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,A LOT more.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The short game was great.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I expected bounce problems when pushing, but the ball stayed very low and sharp."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Blocking wasn't too bad.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The only thing I would say is that it has a complicated character.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"It behaves like a soft sponge rubber in a lot of ways, but when hitting hard it doesn't bottom out easily."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I'm used to soft sponges and have learned to compensate for this, which works against me somewhat with this rubber."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"So I hit off a fair bit.I wanted to use this as a backhand rubber, but I think it suits my forehand better."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It's the first time since I used T05 where I've been shocked by ease of spin generation on low-effort loops.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I'm not saying that it's a T05 clone, because it isn't."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It just seems to share that characteristic.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"It's impressed me, and I think there's a lot of potential there."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,AndySmith: Thanks for the update.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I also read it on AlexTT.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Just curious, is Calix an all wood blade or one of those with fibres?"
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I am putting my sheet of GS on a 7-ply all wood blade.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I wonder what kind of blade will GS perform best with.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I guess the answer is to try it out.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The Nexy Calix is quite a unique blade.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Thin mahogany outer ply, carbon."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I'm not sure about what blade GS suits yet either.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Going to give it another go on the OSP Expert next.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It sounds a lot like the KTL Red Diamond to me...
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,i like that review
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"After playing with GS for a few days, I've gone and ordered sheets of the new KTL versions of Red Diamond and Black Power."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Hopefully one will suit my backhand, because GS has sorted my forehand search out for a while."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Will start with RD, so will be able to compare directly.The last thing I am curious about is the other version of GS - the Fast Attack one."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"If it wasn't more than twice the price of RD, I would have ordered one of those as well."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I had a two-hour session with a former Chinese provincial player (a full-time professional coach to schools and individuals) I play regularly with.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Here are some of my observations on Golden Star (caveat: the following is not a review; it is merely an initial impression).Blade: 729 BombFH: KTL Golden Star (Fast Attack)BH: Gambler Outlaw - didn't get a chance to drop by a shop to get a Vega Pro.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Decided to use Outlaw instead of other rubbers I have at home.I thought the speed is fast comparing to what I have played with (T05, T64, F-1, Baracuda, Hexer HD, S2, Vega Asia, Yinhe Moon, Yinhe Sun, Yinhe Mars 2, H3, 729 Super FX Lightening...)."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"No, not the fastest of the bunch, but it's fast considering Bomb is the slowest blade in my collection."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The spin potential is there as well based on the few misses by my hitting partner when I drive looped the ball.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I try not to go into details on individual aspects of GS because I only had a two-hour session which is not enough to form a definitive opinion.Based on my press-o-meter (fingers), the top sheet is medium hard and the sponge is medium to medium hard."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,GS has similar hardness to T64; it is softer than Hexer HD.I reckon a carbon/fibre blade will release the monster in GS.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"On an all wood blade, GS Fast Attack is fast but there are faster combinations out there."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"After a few more hours of hitting with Golden Star (Fast Attack), it is becoming more obvious to me that I need to brush loop really well to utilize the hard top sheet and upper layer of the sponge which is sort of hard (it depends on one's current rubber choice; it is hard comparing to Japanese and Euro rubbers, soft comparing to untuned Chinese rubbers)."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"For players used to drive looping with Jap and Euro rubbers, there is some learning curve there."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,So I am not sure if it is wise for me to put in the time because I will mostly stick with Tenergy and Tensor for the moment.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"For flat hitting with sufficient power, GS Fast Attack is not bad at all."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Folks who have extensive experience with Chinese rubbers, like DHS H3, GS would shine on their hands."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"For EJing purposes, my next attempt is to put my sheet of GS on a faster blade, like the T-7, to see how it plays."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,How does it work when serve?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Can You compari it with T05 in terms of spin, speed?"
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I can only speak for the Loop version, but spin on serving was very high.Comparing to T05 is always a dangerous thing."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"Imagine a slightly tacky T05, with less bounce/reaction in the lower gears, but less spin in the higher gears.Excellent rubber, but complex nature may take some getting used to."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I'm quite happy with it though.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Agree with previous poster on the pitfalls comparing GS to T05.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"However, typical players do need to compare to what we have used before to get a sense of how new blades or rubbers work."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"With specific about spin on serve comparison, I think that GS Fast Attack requires more delicated wrist and fingers coordination to generate strong spin comparing to rubbers with softer topsheets, aka Tenergy and Tensor."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"For example, Baracuda generates very spinny serve fairly easily."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I ordered a couple of sheets of this golden star-I am trying the loop version (more spin less speed) first on a slowish yinhe de-1 blade.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,This is a nice quality sheet.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Good pop on firm shots.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Throw is lower than what I was most recently using (729-08 ES) and spin is similar.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It plays better off the table than -08 ES and has less control.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I was able to serve better-I did not have to work as hard to get my serve over the neck.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Will post more after a few more hours.BTW those in the US can get from zeropong and its cheaper than eacheng!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,?
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,i have a the loop version and found it rather faast.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,controll is lacking though lack of feel
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I have had few more sessions with both the fast attack (rated faster) version and the loop (rated more control and spin).
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"I really like the ""slower"" of the 2-it has much greater feel due to the outer softer sponge I guess."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,It is also PLENTY powerful in terms of speed and spin.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,I am pretty excited about this rubber for a long(ish) term commitment.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,My only real concern is how the next sheet feels.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Chinese rubber quality from one batch to the next is notorious and the 2 density sponge scares me in this regard.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"It really does have ""blow it past them"" speed and spin even with my slow blade."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,The really slow high loop is not there.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Blocking requires better touch.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,So the last time people were discussing this was three years ago!
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Apparently gradient sponge is legal after all - which makes one wonder why Butterly abandoned Kawatsuki sponge.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,There's now FOUR versions of this rubber.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"The newer ones are cheaper - more in the $23-24 range - and supposedly produce more spin, according to the blurbage on the back of the packages."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"viewtopic.php?f=9&t=28317&hilit=golden+starDoesn't seem like Golden Cake is a new-fangled Rasantish large pore sponge, either, it's been around at least since 2012."

44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"In fact, GS is a thermical blend of two sponge layers with different density."

44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"In actuality - whatever it is, it LOOKS like two sheets of sponge:If anything, it gives the umpire more ammunition to ""ban"" it."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,But it's got ITTF's approval.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,They've got to know about the sponge.
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,"It's not like it's some deep, dark secret like ""widespread boosting""."
44,5f6c29964272aba9ab7757b8,KTL Golden Star - NEW LKT/KTL rubber,Still wondering why Kawatsuki was abandoned.

45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I'd say the first tensors were usually very fast but not so spinny, then came some tensors that were very spinny but not that fast overall (vega pro, baracuda...), now there's more balance i think, but there's really a bit of everything, it depends from the brand and the rubber itself.To me, among the brands i know, entry level tensors might be:- Tibhar rookie d.tecs- Xiom Vega Europe- Donic Bluefire JP03 - Donic coppa X series- Victas v>01 limber- Butterfly Sriver G3I'd say the easiest is the rookie (not so much spin and speed), the fastest is maybe the v>01, and the most balanced should be JP03 or Vega europe"
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Is a bit of a contradiction in terms 'entry level tensor' but you get what i mean.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,I'd wondered about the Vega Europe so it's good to hear its something i might consider.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Vega Europe is indeed what you are describing.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I have literally called it an ""entry level tensor"" to others."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,It's a good beginners rubber.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I know the zeitgeist among many is to not start with a tensor, but the Vega Europe is so controlled and slow (yes slow) for a tensor that it's a reasonable choice."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Spin is good but not super spin sensitive, and you can take full strokes with confidence."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"My coach loves this rubber for beginners, but hates it for his level (2400-2500 USATT)."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,How would Vega Europe compare to say Hexer and Whale?
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,I haven't tried those other rubbers... sorry.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,I'd hate to comment and color you choice incorrectly.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,i think older versions of tensor are better than new ones eg:Tibhar GeniusDonic BaracudaDonic AcudaXiom VegaAndro Hexerin those u can choose what kind of sponge do u prefer
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I'd be careful about that... for example to me baracuda and vega pro are some of the most spin sensitive rubbers and hard to use, even if not really fast."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Genius is a good rubber indeed, acuda is simple because it's very little spin sensitive even if it's really fast... i don't really know hexer and whale"
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Don't think Sriver G3 is a tensor (it's Japanese, first of all)."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I don't think Tensors are all that hard to play with, so far I've tried two - Palio Macro Pro and Andro Rasant."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,I also briefly hit with Rasant Power Grip.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Yes, they're fast, but really, not terribly faster than, say, Palio Emperor Dragon."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Nothing jarring.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I could push with them without popping up the ball, I could hit and loop."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Chopping was another matter, then again, I can't chop worth anything with inverted anyway..  Kinda disappointing, especially the Rasant."

45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"It's a Tensor, right?"
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Maybe it's the true beginner's Tensor...?
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Anyone here use it?
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,(Reminds me of bananas.. which reminds me of the Minions.. even though it's not yellow..)Iskandar
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,That's an interesting point of view.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I think the newer ones are much better than the older ones, but there you go."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"I don't know what you mean about being able to choose the kind of sponge - you can do that with many of the current gen.Yes, no, sort of....ESN make a lot of rubbers, and the majority are classed as tensors."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Exactly what that entails we don't know.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Best not to start thinking about tension being stored in the topsheet somehow - people can get very touchy about such things.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"And then ESN make some rubbers which aren't classed as tensors, so they lack whatever magic ESN are marketing."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Xiom Musa is a non-tensor ESN rubber, as are Andro Shifter, Joola Zack, Adidas R-Classic."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"People think of them as modern classics - good spin but without the wide gears and top-end speed of some of the more jumpy and reactive tensors out there.That said, these non-tensor ESNs are still a good option for people who want some of the tensor feel but without that higher-end performance."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Musa is a good rubber - solid, dependable, excellent grip, very linear, but heavy and a bit slow."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,It's a safe starting point for anyone who wants to dip their toe into the ESN water.I should say that some of the recent ESN tensors are much easier to use than past generations.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"They are generally less bouncy, more linear, more reliable for grip."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Even the recent softer-sponge options like Acuda P3 and Rasant Beat aren't overly bouncy, which is a step forward IMO (that said, if you like bouncy rubbers then the old stuff is still available, it's all personal)."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"ESN have generally been excellent for quality control and sheet-to-sheet consistency, and you can get some of the more popular ones for £23-£25 a sheet if you know where to look - half the price of Tenergy in the UK, and not much more than the better Chinese rubbers.The OP mentions that they currently use Whale."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"While there are tacky tensors, they remain a niche product for ESN and they've never really taken off in the way you might have expected."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"A lot comes down to individual needs and level, but if you're a Whale user then you might have a brushy FH stroke."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"From the ESN range, as a brushy FH player myself, I've generally found it easier to use something with a hard sponge/soft topsheet, which allows me to keep my stroke as-is when moving from tacky chinese stuff."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"The best out there like this at the moment IMO is Omega V Asia, and it works incredibly well with the plastic ball (if that matters to you)."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"It's still fast and very spinny, but solid and predictable."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"A little sensitive to spin when passive, but so is Whale, and although it's a bit faster than Whale in the short game (no tack to hold the ball up), OVAsia isn't hugely faster than Whale overall."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"But I'm making some big guesses about the OP here, and I could be very wrong."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"(as a counter-point, I've always found it hard to use tensors with hard, stiff topsheets on my brushy FH."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"The original Rhyzm was bad for me on the FH, but excellent in the hands of a more direct power player."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,So YMMV)And don't worry too much about what you thought about Hexer.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,It's quite an old range and the newer ESN stuff is very different (and far better IMO).
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"All tensors that aren't mega hard are very much noob-friendly especially compared to Chinese rubbers on the forehand, because you can get away with much slower strokes and smaller range of motion to produce a decent shot."
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,you get more safety net clearance(more arc) too generally.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,Bluefire JP02 is a very good rubber for example.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"Where Tensors shine though is as backhand rubbers, a fast tensor that isn't super spinny and super hard usually fits most peoples games perfectly"
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,My advice: 1) go straight to a tensor from any generation.
45,5f6c29a44272aba9ab7757bf,To go tensor or not? ,"You will do better with it if you have good spin strokes.2) The harder/heavier the tensor, the thinner the sponge you should use."

46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",In my opinion the newer stuff is better.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma","So that means Vega Japan, Omega IV and Sigma I & II."
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",At our club players who previously played Chinese rubber and hit the ball cleanly with technically sound strokes like Omega IV Pro for forehand.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",Players who want a livelier more European rubber like Sigma or the new Vega Japan.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",Sigma I pro is pretty low dwell and can be hard to control on blades that don't hold the ball long enough.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",Sigma II pro has better dwell and is still very fast.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",Sigma I Europe and Sigma II Europe are both nice for backhand or someone who likes a medium forehand rubber.What is your level and background?
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",If you tell a little more about yourself you may get better recommendations.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",i also want to know   From what i've used:-Vega Europe = Sriver EL GluedVega Elite = Sriver FX Glued
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",Currently using Omega IV Europe and like it very much.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",Soft sponge but it doesnt bottom out.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",I found Vega Europe bottoms out.Vega Pro is a very popular rubber.If you are a beginner/intermediate level player I dont think the difference between them will be that noticeable.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",The main thing for now is to decide on what sort of sponge hardness you prefer.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma","Carbonman, how is Omega IV europe spin compared to Vega Europe."
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",i really think that vega europe lack the spin that i need.

46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",@carbonman : I prefer a softer feel for my rubbers
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",There probably is some difference but I cant remember (its been a while since I Vega Europe).
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",My feeling is that there wasnt much in it.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",If the Omega IV Europe had about 10-15% more spin it would be perfect.
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma","As it is, I still really like it."

46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma","I think the Sigma I is no longer ITTF approved.AFAIK the Sigma series has a lower throw, so it's a little more suitable for blocking & loop dirve, whereas the Omega is higher throw, more suitable for looping."
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma","Comparing to Tenergy, the Sigma would be more like the T64, the Omega more like T05."
46,5f6c29ab4272aba9ab7757c3,"Xiom: Vega, Omega or Sigma",it's still approvedhttp://www.ittf.com/ittf_equipment/Rack ... &textile=&i read on many reviews Omega has less spin than Sigma and i prefer rubbers similar to T05

48,5f6c29b34272aba9ab7757c8,Blutenkirsche 868 Chin. or Friendship Supersoft for defense?,The Toxic 3 will be too slow for almost any type of attack.

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,If you like Aurora and H3- I wouldn't recommend trying these 3.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Why?
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"I haven't played with H3 but it's treated as ""number one"" chinese tacky rubber."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,If you want go step up- try provincial or national version.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Another option- go with Tenergy and modern tensors.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,But they are not better but different and plays differently.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,If H3 (and chinese tacky rubbers in general) suits your game- why change?As for Aurora- I like it a lot.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,It has moderate catapult and grip.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"If you want a bit more catapult and more grip- try 729 Battle, their prices are very close."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,If you want to go even more- take a look at modern tensors and Tenergy.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,They wil give you more power but they are also more demanding.I switched from tensors to Aurora and happy with it.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Aurora is more forgiving.

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Pick the one that fits your style/preference/wallet etc.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"The only quality that can be attributed to ""step up/down"" might be durability."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"What you're paying for is incremental elasticity improvement, at the tune of maybe 10% per doubling of price towards the high tend."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Not true all the time.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"Take the rubber I mentioned earlier - $8 from that vendor, as little as $4 a sheet from ttnpp.com."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"Pretty subtle, like it usually is, but it's there."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"This much I agree with, except that when you go from a $5 rubber to a $20 rubber you're probably gaining 5-7% if that."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,The Palio Dragons in china with retail pack are same price as Yinhe maxtense.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,The fact that not everything <$5 is of same quality of the best Dragon ones you happen to get should be considered.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"I mean, there are haifu Whales going for 15rmb on taobao, and I'm sure some sheets won't be crap, but there's no way to compare the few good ones to any standardized price."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,It's the only Yinhe rubber over $30.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Come to think of it there's only two sheets above $20 (the other is Saturn Pro).

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Is apollo 3 the tacky one or not?
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"Tacky will slow down a rubber, esp at lower impact.--edit: ok yes, it's the tacky one."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Any of its non-tacky peers will be faster; or maybe not if you didn't find the ESN palio to be faster.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,But honestly unless you're swinging at least somewhat fast it's not going to matter since your body will easily compensate for it.The first time I played with Tenergy it was like holy s*** this is auto-looping.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,But again that also doesn't matter since you need to be able to do everything else before topspin part of the point well.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"Yes, Apollo III is tacky, there are sheets faster than it, but most are cheaper (e.g."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Big Dipper is likely faster than Apollo3.

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Making the topsheet tackier doesn't cost anything unlike making the it more elastic.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,All of Yinhe's maxtense non-tacky is about the same speed and faster than the tacky.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,I used them for quite a while and will likely go back once the new ESN I have now falls off.
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"Whale is faster because it's factory tuned, supposedly heavily."

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,The really expensive Haifu rubber is actually Shark III ($70!).
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"And then there's DHS Gold Arc (~$45), Tin Arc 5 (~$35) and H8 ($72)."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"I also notice that Haifu products, like Yinhe products, are ""tunned""."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"In any case, anyone wanting to ""move up"" to more expensive Chinese rubber (faster or not) doesn't have much to choose from unless you get into the dubious ""National Versions""."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,"Moving away from China, there's a lot of choice, of course."
49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,All the way up to Tenergy (which might actually be cheaper than H8 or Shark III).

49,5f6c29d24272aba9ab7757d9,Keep Playing with Low Cost(Cheap) Rubbers or Bite the Bullet,Deep down I know its nothing to do with equipment so this weekend I'm going to give him a hit with my set-up just to remind myself of that.
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,Useless for You...I use 1.9 on my FH and Like it a Lot...
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,"For all the Tenergy users, I'm wondering if you feel a lot of difference with the new ball."
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,I got some friends who complains about not getting close as much spin with their rubbers anymore.
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,The new ball is less spinier I know but do you guys feel a lot difference when it comes to spin?
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,Everything seems to take more effort with the new balls.
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,"I doubt an equipment change is the answer, though.I have always had this bias that one should use the maximum possible thickness of rubber."
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,But.......
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,I have never tried a thinner one.
50,5f6c29d44272aba9ab7757da,Difference in throw angle of 05 Tenergy 1.9 / 2.1,So I am glad someone did.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"This rubber plays just like tenergy, i need more testing before i can put a review on this rubber"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,any updates on this rubber?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"How much is a sheet?I want to buy some good, cheap rubbers for a couple of new blades very soon."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I'd be very interested in knowing the properties of these rubbers.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"When you say they compare to Tenergy 25, what are the characteristics of T25?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Oskar, this stuff should be 3x less expensive than any Tenergy.I am going to Seoul today to Nexy HQ and get me sum Moon/Sun/Venus II along with sum other TT gear/apparel."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"My Red sheet of Outlaw is expiring (Topsheet separating 1/2 cm from top and getting bigger by the game minute, so the time is due for slapping on some new rubber."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Since I do not have a tourney for another two weeks, I can get away with testing for a week or two."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Do you think these rubbers are suited to someone looking for ALL+ to OFF type play?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I emailed a shop in Belgium, cause they also had the Sun rubber."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"They claimed it was a bit lower throw than Moon, still high, and had a bit more control."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I think the nice control and spin of T05 would suit a number of styles of play, both Offensive, Allround, maybe even the FH side of a modern defender."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"if any of these new rubbers do essentially the same things the tenergy series does, shouldn't be a problem, even if you have to adjust some."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I just got a sheet of Sun (and also Venus II, which nexy says will probably disappoint me) today and maybe I test it on a backup blade soon."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,BumpAnyone feel able to review it yet?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,No one has put this rubber in their signature so I'm guessing it's not overwhelming anyone in performance.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I have not yet tried it.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I talked to a friend who tried it and likes it for his backhand.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"He tells me pushes with soft contact is not very spinny, but once you dig the ball in a little it becomes very spinny."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,He like it most for blocking and hitting and tells me it's quite insensitive to spin.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Next time I see him I'll try and have a hit with his bat.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,same question with the Moon thread  haggisv would you happen to know what degree of hardness one should get if one wants same feel as T25 & T25fx?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,what thickness should one get which will be closest to the speed/spin of T25 2.1.TIA
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I got Sun and slapped it on the backup W6 looping blade.This is a monster of a relooping rubber.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Opening loops and counter loops are solid strengths of this rubber.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"It doesn't lay the smack down like Outlaw does, but this is one heck of a consistant looping rubber."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I think Skippy would love this rubber, especially considering he got by with XP Super Power 2008 for a spell, as well as I did on BH for a year."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Der_Echte,What thickness & hardness did you slap on your blade?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"If tenergy 05/25 is rated 10 for speed and spin, how would you rate the SUN?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,thanks
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I got max thickness (I think Max runs around 2.2) in the hardest sponge available when I was at Nexy's HQ in Bucheon.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I'm sorry I never really looked at the hardenss degree.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"As for speed, hard to tell vs T25 as I never had any long hit with that, and that was 2 yrs ago."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Sun seemed to have at least as much or more speed than T05.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"The W6 isn't exactly a monster power slapping blade, just a great looping blade."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,The rubber had a lot of T05 kind of properties in the continuous looping department with decent spin and great spin.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,The Sun on the W-6 felt faster than T05 on the Nexy Lissom did though.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,is there a pro version of this
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"what's the hardness?given the size of the pips... do you see any sudden change in throw angle, or is it predicatable across speed range?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,i remember LKT torrent had huge pips... and it had that problem.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Is this Sun a tacky rubber?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,The regular version of Sun is non-tacky.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Since the pro version of Moon is tacky (whereas the regular is non-tacky) I assume the Pro version of Sun is tacky too...
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I have not yet seen the Pro version, and I'm not sure if they've brought it out yet."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"this site should help.. there is a search bar on the left side of the page if u want to check out other equipment, also u could use there charts which are handy http://www.tabletennisdb.com/rubber/http://www.tabletennisdb.com/rubber/yin ... y-sun.html"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Thanks guys for the quick info.haggisv, they have brought out the Sun Pro already."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I seen it being sold on another site.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Anyway, have tried both the Moon Pro and Mercury II which I got off the OOAK shop recently."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I must say I am impressed with both rubbers.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"The Moon Pro seems a very lively rubber very much like Tenergy 05, except that its tacky surface does not allow me to do my favourite delicate touch drop shot."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,The tackiness sort of make the ball drop very short from the blade before the net instead of over the net  I would need to adjust a bit there.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"But overall, for the price, I am really impressed."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"As for Mercury II, I must say it is also a very good rubber if one is after a bit more control."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Yet, if required, a smash with the rubber brings it to life and it is fast enough to cause my opponent trouble."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I particularly like its blocking ability.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"However, this is based on only a couple of hours hit up recently."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Must give it a bit more time.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"So far, the nice thing is I actually don't miss my Tenergy 05 when I was hitting with the Moon Pro which is quite a feat"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,sun pro where?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,No not really in this case.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"That site simply uses the descriptions from the manufacturer... and we all know how useful that is    Reviews (on reviews sites like that one and and on forums) are far more useful, as they skip the marketing hype and tell you what it's really like"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"nope its comunity rated , it been raated 5 times, but no pesonal review for it yet, on tht site nyway"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Here: http://ttnpp.com/shop/rubber-galaxy-yinhe-c-4_87.html
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Good to see they've released that one as well..... not sure if the price is a mistake, as the cost of the Pro version is only about 20% more than the regular version."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Haggisv, Why is it hard to believe?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"You are not dealing with BTY,,,,,"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Don't worry about their price.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I am happy with your price
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"stuck on a sheet of sun earlier on, i think its 38degree, along with TG2 neo on stiga allround oversize.i also notice that the pip size on the sun i quite large like short pips large( stiga clippa), where as on the other hand the pips on the tg2 are tiny.with the rubber in the packaging came a sheet of adhesive film.. i take it its to protect the rubber?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,or to clean it from dust?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"had a closer look at the rubber, found out that the sponge is quite brittle, it takes very little force to split the sponge."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"this iscompletely different when it comes to the likes of the hurricane rubbers or most others, also the rubber isnt that strong either.now on a different note it plays quite beautifully, the speed is way greater than H3 rubbers, or even H3 prov."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"it lacks a bit in control, spin is also great, the catapult effect feels like t05( very lively) now this is on a mahogany(2) balsa mahogany(2) blade ( Ross Leidy blade)."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"blocking is quite good as the ball catapult away at almost warp speed,as i mentioned the controll is quite a handful, but after an hour i more or less got used to it"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Has anyone had a good look at these rubbers compared to LKTs RD and BP, I'm sure they are coming off the same production line."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Same brittle sponge, same stick protector sheet...... same rubber?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,!
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I tried on pen hold back hand, very nice hitting and attacking, but when looping (I am used to H3 kind of loop) it lacks the arch I like unless you slow down, maybe just my techniques..."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,the top sheet is also quite weird as its kinda grainy ( kinda like part tacky part smooth) .
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I tried galaxy sun 2.2, black, on my dawei wavestone blade."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Results: the throw was high, almost like tenergy 05 (I haven't tried the other tenergys)."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"The rubber was sensibly harder than tenergy, though softer than Hurricane 3."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Any speed glue effect seemed to be absent.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"There was no ""corking"" sound."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"The spin seemed to be good, like tenergy (which by the way I find less spinny than Hurricane 3 or Globe 999, but I am going off topic)."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"speed: with a carbon blade like wavestone, this rubber is fast enough for anyone."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"(if not too fast)bottom line: if you need good power, good spin, and a high throw, and don't have money for T05, this could be the best rubber for you."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,speed definately faster than t05....this reminds me of Stigs neos Sound.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,at it feels like it lacks spin although since im using it on a jpen to which im not really acustomed to yet is hard to tell
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Sun on forhand: prety speedy but there is no spin what's for ever, so I think I would sell it if anyone wants it."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,What hardness is the rubber sponge?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,How much do you want for it?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,?
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Eacheng offers various degrees of hardness... 36 to 38.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"did anyone try 36 degrees sun (regular, not pro) as a FH rubber?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,That's what I'm using on my second setup.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I got the softer one hoping it would be lighter:Good catapult, medium-high throw angle."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Very good at hitting backspin and flicking serves... seems quite immune to incoming spin even in softer sponge.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Brush strokes are amazing, but mechanical spin is not that great for some reason."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,For own serves it's not too special but the control in nice.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Also has click when hitting but that might be emphasized by the varnish on my blade.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Speed is very good even on an OFF- blade, you don't need to swing that much, even on smashes."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I found I could do all shots reasonably well: Hits are very linear, quick but a bit spinless, Loops are great (but with brushing, not full contact), Chops are controlled and can be kept low, but not as spinny as say a Tacki."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"series rubber, Blocking worked for me because of the slower blade but it will be an issue for others.I'd recommend this rubber to someone with a controlled attack game, power-loopers willl not like it that much."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Price is not bad either.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"tnx  pity for not having good mechanical spin because that's exactly what i was hoping from softer sponge version...i'd say it's sponge limit, good mechanical spin should come from sponge"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Aside from Outlaw, what Chinese rubbers have mechanical spin ?"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"for what i know, chinese rubbers with japanese biotechs...palio cj8000 36-38 deg."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"japanese biotech has astounding mechanical spin...too bad it bottoms out, and too bad there is no cj8000 39-41 deg."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,japanese biotech available...there are chinese biotechs but only one i had was odd.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"it was almost impossible to loop with, yet excellent to drive/loopdrive with."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,very strange.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"although, 'japanese' biotechs are probably just good batches of chinese biotechs, called 'japanese' for marketing purposeswhen you think of it, every non-tacky rubber without good mechanical spin is spin inferior, and there are plenty of non-tacky chinese rubbers on the market"
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,I'm a sun pro user (red max 33°) I like i but want it to be somewhat faster.Options:- try sun pro with the hardest possible sponge.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Would that make it faster?- I've never tried the normal sun.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Is it faster than the sun pro version because it is non tacky?- take out my wallet and go for Tenergy 25Could you give me some comments on that?Thx
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,i think the one i tried was the normal one.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,and its pretty fast.. plays kinda like t25 large pip size.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,pretty good for lifing/attacking backspin as far as i remember.. tried it on a clipper and it was pretty fast.wouldnt hurt buying the normal to try it since its a cheap rubber
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"I just bought from my local dealer a sheet of Galaxy Sun in 36*:And compared it to the classic Sriver EL I had:Hmm, pip size looks promising."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"It does seem similar to T25, which I like, but find too expensive to keep buying.I'll report once I played with it."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Similar in play with Tenergy 25, without the glue effect, sponge feels kind of dead compared to my last impression of the Tenergy series."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Faster than the old kind of rubbers like classic Sriver and the like, though, so if you just need an increment of speed, and it's not too expensive."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,"Similar to Tenergy though, the ball doesn't stall much."
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Like Chinese tacky rubbers.
51,5f6c29fc4272aba9ab7757e9,Galaxy /Yin-He Sun rubber,Weren't KTLand LKT brand names of Friendship/729?

52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Powersponge.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Used it in max on an innerforce ZLC & a xiom zetra quad.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Quite light.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Easy to loop with.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Didn't work for me on on the FH when the throw flattens off too much on harder hits.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Grippy rubber.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Older generation.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Probably too soft.Joola rhyzm.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Haven't used this but the joola rhyzm 42.5 is highly thought of as an excellent BH rubber.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Joola maxx series is slightly faster having used the 400.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,There is a version called the maxx-p & a rhyzm -p optimised for the plastic ball both rated at 42.5 degrees (have not used them).
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,FX-P. Used this on the FH of a SZLC & and both sides of a IF ZLC.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Very decent rubber medium throw good control.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Good all rounder.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Most use it on the BH but also works well on the FH particularly if your blade isn't too stiff that is has a bit of flex.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Slightly heavy (as with all evolution rubbers) in max at around 44 grams cut but you could opt for a slightly thinner version.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Rated as medium soft & a very sensible choice.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Doesn't feel as good as a T05FX but the FX-P is a high quality rubber and lasts better.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Worthwhile doing a search for a review on the maxx-p and rhyzm-p rubbers with the latter reviewed as more dynamic if memory serves me correctly.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Do you still have the TBS ?
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,And have you moved away from BH rubbers optimised for chopping or pips ?
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,"Multispoke Thanks for responding.I changed the TBS by Stiga Offensive Classic Carbon.I quit gums long pimples, the last one I used was the Palio CK531A 0.6-0.8 mm."
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,I had a stiga offensive classic briefly after a stiga all round and didn't like it.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,It was heavy and gave a hollow sound.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Have not tried the carbon version.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Checking the composition off the blade unsure if it's using a dyed koto or a walnut but either way feel that it may limit your choices over the TBS.Would be tempted to try out a joola maxx 400 on one side and see how you get on.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,The Tibhar 5Q VIP (42.5) is a very impressive rubber.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Have tried both on a xiom zetra quad and it suited the slightly stiff blade.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,From the reviews it seems there's a hard feel of the offensive classic carbon.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,Unsure how those rubbers would perform with the plastic ball.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,If your blade weight is > 90 grams I would drop to a 1.9 on the BH to keep your setup to a sensible 185 grams which is the max weight that I can cope with.
52,5f6c2a657da9e46ccbe15456,Hexer Powersponge/Joola Rhyzm 37.5/Tibhar Evolution FX-P,"I've made a decision to use in 2015:Racket 1) FH = Donic Bluefire JP03 / BH = Joola Rhyzm 37.5 / Blade: Stiga Offensive Classic Carbon.Racket 2) FH = Andro Hexer Powersponge / BH = TIBHAR Evolution FX-P / Blade: Stiga Offensive Classic Carbon.In future try one Joola Rhyzm - P ...Well I have two blades (no rubber) TBS and Yasaka Ma Lin Extra Offensive.As data: In tournaments I play I do not believe in Argentina in 2015 the new ball ""poly-ball"" is used, for the price and they break very fast (short duration)."
53,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,Seems like I posted a difficult question.
53,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,"Or can you recommend a rubber which is similar to roxon 450, but spinnier and grippier ?"
53,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,Having never played with either I am not much help.
53,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,Rasant Power Grip is meant to be a hard sponge if I remember correctly so would not suit you if you like medium-soft sponge.
53,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,"You could try the Rasant Grip, its the new one with a medium sponge... but I haven't used it so I'm just guessing here.You could try something like BlueFire M2, or Xiom Omega Euro."
53,5f6c2a7a7da9e46ccbe15461,comparing andro 450 to rasant grip or rasant power grip,I think the Omega Euro would be fine as I found that felt slightly softer then the M2 on my Viscaria.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"All of the Bluefires are a more recent generation of ESN, and don't really feel like R7Soft."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,So that's something I suppose!Yes.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Well, I suppose it depends on why you couldn't get in with T05, but if you're looking for something close to T05-FX then M2 is too hard IMO.M3 is the closest to R7Soft of the bunch, yes, but it's still quite different."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"M3 is soft, but it isn't as soft as R7Soft, and is punchier and more definite."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Less slingy than R7Soft.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"M3 is also high throw - big cartoon arcs on heavy strokes, where the dwell becomes more apparent."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I'd say M3 is the closest to T05-fx overall.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"M3 is heavily boosted in the factory, and loses a bit of pace when it wears out.I did have trouble with M3 on soft (hinoki) blades - couldn't get used to the gears on my BH side (great on FH though)."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"But I also had the same problem with T05-fx on the same blades, so just my technique probably."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Stick to medium outers (or harder, obvs) and you'll be fine regardless.IMO, no."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,JP03 is medium throw with a dead feel in the short game.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"The dead feel can lead to an overall feel of mushy mush mush, so if you're trying to avoid that then beware!"
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"JP03 is highly elastic in feel though, so it livens up a lot when you hit heavier shots."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"It's very similar to Rasant Powersponge, if you've tried that?There are tensors out there which fit your T05-fx search better than the Bluefires, IMO."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Tibhar 5Q Sound (Power Update) is a bit softer, but shares a LOT of characteristics with T05-fx."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"It loses out on spin overall, but is close in most departments otherwise."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"It's on sale at tt11 quite regularly if you keep an eye out.I have some of these rubbers in my cupboard, waiting for an eBay clear-out."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,You're welcome to try some out if you like?
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Send a PM if you want.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Andy,Many thanks for your reply, it was very useful!To answer one of your questions, yes I have tried Rasant Powersponge and I did like it."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"In fact, I was very close to using it as my primary rubber but it was only because I had a newer sheet of 05-FX available that I went back to it."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I found the Powersponge a LOT better than Rakza 7 Soft.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"The Rakza felt mushy, way too soft and horrible compared to the harder more positive direct feeling 05-FX."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,The Rasant Powersponge sat more in the middle of the two.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,It was softer but not too soft and had some real power when you hit it hard.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"I wonder of the two, whether M2 or JP03 would be better."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Ah, well there you go then!"
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"When I had Rasant PS, I couldn't tell much difference between it and JP03."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,They felt identical in the short game.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"The Rasant seemed to stay a bit lower on harder shots, so I'd probably call it a lower throw rubber than JP03 overall, but it's so, so close."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"I actually preferred Rasant PS for my BH side, but I stuck with JP03 because I can get Donic stuff more reliably and cheaply than Andro."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"They are so similar that I'd say you know 90% of how JP03 will play.M2 is faster, harder, higher throw, more aggressive than JP03."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"JP03 is a lot easier to use in the short game - it's not as sensitive to spin, and it's slower there."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,It just comes down to your needs really.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"Are you the type to hit big, ridiculous loop monster winners (M2)?"
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Or do you play a variable offensive game with more control and variation (JP03)?
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"(I'm generalising wildly here, but you get the idea)."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,It sounds as if I could actually play with either.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,However I do prefer to loop as much as possible.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,I guess my game could be described as close to the table counter attack where I use my pips to block and set up the ball.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"When the ball is high enough and I'm in position, the I loop / power loop it."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,So I guess you could say I play both a variable game with control (but that's probably more on my pips) and I also play a strong looping game on my forehand (as that's my primary attack shot).
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Not sure if that helps but maybe M2 would be more appropriate?
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,"I normally use 05fx,I tried m3 but went back to 05fx.I liked the extra pop of the m3 but the loop arc was straighter and longer compared to the Tenergy and I couldn`t push as well, this was well used Tenergy which seemed spinnier to me,I think the m3 performance will drop fairly quickly compared to the 05fx which in the long run is probably better value along with the enhanced performance.Both rubbers were spinmaxed,the Tenergy reacted more to this treatment."
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Have you looked at Tibhar 5Q VIP ?I got 2 sheets of it but ended up selling them to 2 club mates.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Both are using it on their FH on a Clpper & a Xiom Zetra Quad.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,First guy loves it and wants another on the BH whilst the XZQ guy is only just getting used to it after 2-3 weeks but will ultimately look to change it (have a Tenzone SF lined up for him).5Q VIP has the same hardness as the 05FX and uses a large porous Tenergy like sponge.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,Available in 1.7Top sheet of the VIP is the same as the 5Q which I had but was too fast on the BH of a IF ZLC and I didn't want to use it on the FH which lacked the consistent arc of the T05.
54,5f6c2ab27da9e46ccbe15482,Donic JP / M series vs Tenergy FX,5Q uses the same topsheet as the VIP which had excellent grip.
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Andro Impuls is available in 1.5mm, and is explicitly a tensor."
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Shifter and shifter powersponge are also available in 1.5, likewise Backside, but I don't know if these count!"
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,So it's not just Chinese rubbers that are only available thick..Iskandar
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Alex youre using a rubber that comes in 1.5, victas 401..."
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Thanks LordCope, I didn't know Impuls came in 1.5mm, and most carry it only in 1.8mm or higher.Yes, not sure if the others are Tensors."
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Hmmm yes,  , not sure if this is a Tensors though."
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,Its made in germany rigth?
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Only some of the German made rubbers are Tensors, many are the traditional-type rubbers."
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"For example Donic Coppa is made by ESN, but it's not a Tensor."
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,Tensors usually have the Tensor symbol on there (or in Donic's case it's called Formula).
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,Not all the esn tensors have the simbol in it.
55,5f6c2ab67da9e46ccbe15485,Tensors in 1.5mm or less?,"Thibar, victas, yasaka, and the new joolas dont have the tensor simbol in the rubber and in the pack...I can see that all the victas rubbers have the simbol of High Energy Tension, even the 401, so i think its a tensor too, not just a ESN product."

56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,Been playing with it since April and I find it does everything well (loop/push/chop/block/hit) but needs an off- blade or better to get speed out of it.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,I'm using a Yinhe T-7 blade which may be slightly slower the Timo Boll ALC.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"My playing style is close to mid distance, loop/block/hit."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,I find the harder sponge gives me more control than the euro/jap sponges.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,That's actually what I'm using right now for forehand!
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"It performs most hits pretty well, but the topsheet is very tacky, and the rubber is very heavy for how relatively dull and lifeless it is."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"As far as Chinese rubbers go it is a good one, and if speed glue were still around it'd be a different story, but for right now I'm looking for something in the Euro/Jap rubber neighborhood."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,Thanks for your response though
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,I used Hammond Pro Beta for a few months when I was a double inverted player.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"One strange thing about it was that the rubber seemed very brittle- as in crumbling around the edges and the ONE time I knicked the table with it, a chunk was gouged out of the middle top."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"Perhaps I just got a bum rubber, I hope that is the case."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,I called Paddle Palace and they at least gave me a discount on a sheet of Razka 7 to replace it.

56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,it is cheap and I love it on a Off- blade.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,You can smash and block amazingly and is very good at the drive.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"If someone decides to send you backspin, you can even loop it."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,at $14 per sheet for the 35degree sponge it's worth a try
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,Interesting you'd say so..
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,I actually have a backup-to-my-backup/just-for-fun paddle which is a Yinhe/Galaxy T-11 with 802-40 in 2.1mm both sides.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"It hits very, very well for most blocks and of course smashes very well, but I found that I don't get as much versatility in certain aspects of short game, nor in serves; two things I excel at (not to mention, times when I have to step away from the table a few feet)."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"In fact, when I play anyone 1700 or less, my serves win, on average, a third of my points."

56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,I tried using it as my main piece for awhile but in the end decided double inverted was for me.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"EDIT: I don't want something anywhere near as spinny as say, Tenergy 05 (not to mention the terrifyingly high throw), but I do need more spin than even the spinnier short pips.Thanks for the suggestion thoughTwo other things that stood out as being potentially up my alley are Bryce Speed or Donic Coppa x1 Gold/Turbo."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"If anyone has played with either, I'd love to hear something about it"

56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"Xiom Omega 4 Elite.Soft, yes, but does exactly what you want.. while allowing (very) spiny serves when needed."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,Out of the ones you list Bryce Speed would be the closest to the characteristics you want.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"It is low throw, insensitive to incoming spin when blocking and hitting, very fast when driving and smashing."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"Once you learn how to grab the ball well with it you can also generate high spin, low bouncing troublesome loops."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,It is a very fast rubber though.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"Sriver also fits the characteristics you describe, albeit slower generally than bryce speed."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"If you go 1.9mm thick then it will be even easier to hit through an opponents spin and punch block, still be fast when hitting, plus light in weight!I played Hammond Pro Beta for a while and it is soft, spinny, reactive to spin, bouncy, medium-high throw and quite fast."
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,The original Hammond is closer to what you want.
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,"Thank you, exactly the info I was looking for!"
56,5f6c2acd7da9e46ccbe15493,Hammond Pro Beta for block/drive/smash?or other suggestions?,Bryce Speed it is.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,which one was like t05?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,is this pro version significantly more expensive?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I'm going to be interested in this topic.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I just tried Tenergy 64, and I like it more than tensors."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I don't think my shots are that much better (maybe 5-10%), but the control and feel is much better.But with a pricetag of 56 euros I refuse to buy those rubbers."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,So this could be an alternative.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Galaxy market the Moon as similar to T05.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The Pro version is only a little more expensive to the regular Moon.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I remember now that they told me that the Pro version is for Professional players, and is more tacky."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I've yet to see if it's actually tacky or just more grippy, or if it's anything different at all.We've got a 33deg and 36deg version, I don't know which will be closest in hardness to T05."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,It's just that you mention T05 twice in your first thread haggisv I actually really like T64 too.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I can still justify the price of T64 as it lasts 3-4 times longer than the tensor I used to use - I was killing them every 2-3 weeks back then...
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Grrrrr..... fixed!
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,t25 eh?Everything I read about that rubber says that it's not very good...
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I guess they didn't read that!
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"New versions of Moon and Sun are getting hyped up here in Korean online, especially on Hedgehog's forum."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Next sells it as well.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Maybe I test it out next time i visit him at his HQ.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I am way overdue for a visit.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The 50 minute bus ride takes me within 200 Meters of his HQ, no real excuse not to visit sometime this month."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Nexy has a room setup with one table (decent room) for his staff and customers to tryout stuff.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Maybe I make a vid.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I got a lot better, but maybe he wouldn't want that vid on the internetz."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Maybe I should film only when I play one of his staff members.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"He would be disappointed to hear I broke my sample Lissom, but playing with it as a main blade a few months really helped out my overall TT game immeasureably.All this talk about Moon makes me want to slap on a sheet (on the TBS) and go at it."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Isn't that the objective and the fun of TT gear experimenting?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Any chance you will also review the Mars V2 rubber?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,That would be the Tenergy 64 clone and it is what I'm most interrested in.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Really, I had no heard that!"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,In all wlee known e-shops Moon rubbers are out of stock.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Where is possible to buy it now?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"This is what I found on the internet:Non-tacky Galaxy rubbers compared:- Galaxy Moon, High throw, offensive rubber, comparable with Butterfly Tenergy 05!- Galaxy Sun, Lower throw, close to table attack, comparable with Butterfly Tenergy 25!- Galaxy Mars V2, Lowest throw, offensive rubber, controlled version of Butterfly Tenergy 64!So that's why I asked"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Someone said Moon is better than Thor's, just one person but still that's a big call it must be at least half way good."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"That writing looks like it came from the blue whale etching machine doesn't it?, I'm assuming yinhe don't own a rubber factory?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I've just glued a sheet onto a blade, with t05 on the other side... should be a good test tomorrow."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I decide to test the 33deg version first, so that will be softer than T05."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"By the way, what I just notied was that the sponge of the Pro version has a sort of pink colour."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Definantly not the orange colour the Mars v2 has.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Does this pro version sponge have those bubbled sponge or not?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The pores are bigger than a standard rubber, but not as big as T05."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I've not compared it to the new Mars as yet.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I had a bit of the hit with the rubber today.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Although I put a T05 on the other side of the blade for comparison, when I pulled out the bat I realised I mistakenly glue them onto a combination bat (Ulmo Die Angel), so I really need to try them onto another blade to confirm.I tested the Moon Pro, black 33deg.Moon Pro is (mildly) tacky like a Chinese tacky rubber.."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I can actually pick up the ball with for a short while.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I could definitely feel quite a bit of tension in the sheet, even when I bounced the ball of the bat quite softly."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I'm not sure that this rubber is actually factory tuned, as there was no residue on the sponge, and there was no glue layer on the back like there is for Apollo / BWII , etc."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The good if it's not tuned is that the effect should not fade away, or at least not as fast.Apart from the fairly high tension in the topsheet, it does not really play like a glued up rubber, nor does it have the sound of one."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"However it is quite a fast, spinny and high performance rubber, and comparing it to T05 is not too far fetched, as it does similarities.Short game - Moon is a little slower, deader and spinnier, partially due to the tacky of the moon."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The tacky really only slows down the rubber at very low impact, and it picks up speed fast after that.Serves - Moon is definitely easier to get high spin with, as it serves like a tacky rubber."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The lower speed means you can rip it a little harder as well without making it too deep.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Slow loops - Moon is slightly slower but very spinny.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"T05 is faster with similar spin.Power loops - T05 has quite a bit more catapult, and produces a higher arc."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Moon has a lower arc and comes off significantly faster.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Both are very spinny, but due to the different arcs it was a little hard to work out which was spinnier."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,T05 has more of the clicky feel that glue gives you.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Both produces great kick on sidespin loops.Blocking - Moon is easier to block with, mainly due the lower catapult and less sensitivity to spin when the ball digs in.I found Moon to be more linear, whereas T05 generates more power and spin with less effort."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I played quite a few games, and could not make up my mind which I liked better."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I do like the glue feel of the T05, but prefer the tacky topsheet and higher speed of the Moon.Comparing it to Thor's, I'd say I still like the Thor's better, as this also has a bit of that Tensor feel and has a higher arc, closer to T05."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Grip / tack on Thor's and Moon is similar, perhaps Moon a little more tack.I will try both rubber on another blade, probably the Virtuoso blade, and will do another comparison.NOTE: This is only a prelimiary test..."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I need to test more to conform my findings, and to be sure that the different sides of the blade was not affecting the comparison."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Very interesting to read.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Never expected it to be this good.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I will wait for your next report with T05 en Moon on the same blade, and if I like that result chances are high I will order a Mars V2 to compare that one with T64.By the way.. do you think a red sheet of Moon is non-tacky from the start?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Thanks for the review!How would you compare them as far as handling incoming serve/spin?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Which one is more reactive?I have 38 deg regular moon and sun, but have too many other rubbers laying around to try too.."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Against serve/pushes they are both a little sensitive, still less than many tacky rubbers."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Against loops the T05 is quite a bit more sensitive.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I forgot to mention:Weight 59g for a MAX thickness 165mm (W) 161mm (H)Hardness measures at 39deg on my scale, but it feels softer than that with my finger?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,anyone with a link to where either the moon/ sun ( both pro) can be bought.ive found the pro sun version on eacheng.net but cant fidn the pro moon version
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,www.tabletennisshop.com.au  Both Pro versions and they are very cheap.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Thanks cstt!
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Actually only Moon is the Pro version, Sun is the regular version at OOAK shop.Difference between regular and Pro versions:Pro version are actually tacky whereas the regular non-tacky."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I'm told the colour of thr sponge is different too, although I don't know if it's actually a different type of sponge too."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Last night i had a chance to test the Sun and the Moon pro version.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I think the red sponge on the Sun is better than the pink sponge from the Moon pro version.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The Red sponge has more power bouncier.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,These rubbers could be the right replacement for tenergy series.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"haggisv, are there any other rubbers that this feels closer to than T05?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"ie, is it more like, say, other Galaxy rubbers?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Does it have that typical galaxy feel?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,In that case I'd like to know why the orange sponge is cheaper  Maybe the Pro versions doesn't give it's power as easily as the normal version?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"It does not have the feel of a glue effect rubber, apart from the tension in the topsheet."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The Moon Pro also does not have the catapult that the T05 does, as I mentioned before.It's probably closer in feel to the Thor's than it is to the T05.BTW I tried it on the Ulmo Ebenholz blade, again with T05 on the other side."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The trajectory of the Moon Pro felt flatter on power loops, I did not like it as much."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The T05 did not feel as nice either actually.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Perhaps this rubber works better on softer blades with some flex.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,If I understand it correctly you say T05 has more catapult than Moon Pro.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I translate catapult into easy accessible power.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"However, you said Moon Pro was faster."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Could you enlighten me here?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"With the T05 you feel the ball sink in and then kick out, particulartly at medium speed."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"With Moon Pro it's more direct, like the fast non-glue effect rubber."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Ok so Thors still keeps it's place on your blade, if you have played with Red Diamond is Moon something like that?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"sounds a bit like it, being hard and direct/crispy kind of rubber."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Always keeping an eye on the best cheap tacky rubber, I still have Red Diamond on top of that list but Moon seems worth paying attention to"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"No I have not tired the RD, so I can't compare."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"so, you are saying in other words that it has shorter dwell time, kicking the ball out more quickly?is it springy feel?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I would not say lower dwell time, as I can feel the ball dig in, but it definitely feels less springy."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Haggisv, any plans to review mercury 2?I'll chime in if you do"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Mercury II is supposed to be a slower and more control rubber, which makes me not so excited to try it    The packaging looks nice, and I noticed immediately how very light it felt (inside the packaging)."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,That's as far as I got.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Try it and I think you will change your mind  I HATED mercury 1, though.."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,only in comparison with tensors and similar catapult effect rubber.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,the time from when ball digs in till the moment it is kicked out is dwell.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"catapult effect is when we feel ball is long in sponge, yet when it is kicked out it is surprisingly fast, not expected considering how long it dwelled in sponge."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"with classic sponge you can expect either if ball stayed about same time in sponge to be much slower when it leaves rubber, or if the speed is similar then the dwell time was shorter."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"this is the case with spring sponges without catapult effect, the way i see it."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"balls get springed out fast, but at the cost of shorter dwelling in rubber."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"however, what rubber can do in time ball is in rubber/sponge is different story."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,with enough grip...
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"haggisv would you happen to know what degree of hardness one should get if one wants same feel as T05, T05fx and T64?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"what thickness should one get which will be closest to the speed/spin of T05 2.1, wouldnt be 2.3mm be too thick and faster than T05 2.1?TIA"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,One question.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Do all these Moon Pro, Sun, etc rubbers with this 'max tense' technology curl a bit when you remove from the package or do they lay flat?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Thanks.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,They lay pretty flat
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Damn, just the answer I don't want  Looks like I have to get myself one of this Moon to try"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I'd really like to compare the regular Moon with the Moon Pro.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Any updates ?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,any difference between black and red
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"So, lets say someone was to do a head to head shoot out to see what is the champion of cheap rubbers and you were going to use one of the Galaxy rubbers vs Red Diamond."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Which Galaxy rubber would have the best chance?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,That would be Galaxy Apollo vs Red Diamond.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Apollo would hands down in looping and counterlooping.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Red Diamond would win in blocking and in anything a player values association in playing with a brick like feel.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,lolWhen i tried both I'd have put them the other way around.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Apollo felt like a brick to me.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Apollo isn't any good is it?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,:p I didn't think that would be even half as good as RD.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I was thinking more about these new rubbers moon/sun etc would be good enough to compare
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I tried the RD, and it felt like a brick to me... makes me wonder how much difference thre is between sheets, as other have commented quite differently."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I didn't feel the Apollo felt like a brick either... certainly softer than the RD, but it lacked power (but huge amounts of spin)."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I am wondering about the difference of a lot of rubbers.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I have many sheets of RD and one is very different than the others.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,All of them are pretty fast though.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The reviews of many kinds of rubbers by good players leads me to think there is a lot of difference between rubber batches.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"RD feels in terms of hard feel, more less identical to blue whale in 39 degree for me, so kinda hard... but not really."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Lets say crisp?, certainly not ""too hard"" at least for me"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,My RD felt a lot better on a medium fast all wood blade than it did on a harder/faster carbon blade.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Definitely felt brick like on the faster/harder blade.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"It seems that the harder blade brings out the worst in RD, for me anyway."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Just got 2 sheets of Moon (regular version) in and hope to test it out sometime this weekend.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I have a 37 deg and a 41 deg, both in black 2.0 mm."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Will probably test the 41 deg sheet first, see how it compares to Tenergy 05."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"just recieved mine along with ""Sun"", which i kinda regret buying since theres a Pro version available and i only saw it the next day after ordering"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I don't think the Pro version is necessarily better... it's just different.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,well i may order i though after i try the normal version...
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Red Apollo had almost T05 like spin.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"It has power, esecially if you impact it."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"It is next to zero dead catapult on serves and some pushes, You have to modify the angle fpor that."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I could take huge swings with Apollo and still land it high percentage.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The hook and kick were really good on Apollo.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I couldn't stand the brickness of RD, yet i am someone who likes a heavy, solid outfit."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,RD just ricochet off the bat.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Yes, you get the spin."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Yes, i am sure I could adapt to it if I played with it long enough."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"No, I took it off the TBS the second day and gave it away to a club mate that night."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,RD was not for me.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"tried the rubber for RPB and it ok, great control, good spin, speed is jsut above average,, just needs more power to be perfect"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Moon Pro?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"yup.btw s using red rubber , when i say needs power i dont mean its slow."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"just not extremely fast ( not much catapult, unlike t05) , it seems just about right as in well balanced, i dont need to change my technique at all, unlike t05 where the ball seemed to have high throw due to the massive catapult effect.to get the most out of it u need good technique, for experienced players it may lack power just tad."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"this review is based on my and my coaches opinion, he also thinks neo h3 is a tad slow , not as fast as glued up H3/H3 prov so he says"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,yep of course it's slow compared to glued up h3.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"All sponges, tuned or not are considerably faster glued up."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"tis quite comfortable to lay with, i think its more like the mendo family well balanced."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Hi all.I just put a sheet of moon pro on my blade.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Red ,33deg."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"and 2,0mm thick.Used a thin layer Voc glue, but left it wear off for 3 days before testingPlayed it for 3 hours alltogether on fri&sat."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,First of all I want to mention that I have been playing venus II 34 deg.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,for a while and I like it very much.BUT!
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"!,Moon pro is the best rubber I have tried since my ej jurney!!"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The 33 deg.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,version feels quite softer than 34deg.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,venusII.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I would say in jap scale 3deg.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"softer.Ok, its a bit thicker than my 1,8 venusII but thats just a fraction.Its not as tacky as venus II ( I could not really pick up a ball from table) but generates more spin with my technique."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Sometimes I had the feeling that I could hit everything.Its that kind of rubber you slap on and hit like you have played it for 5 years allready.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"It is very linear and doesnt have to much catapult.Short game: controlled and very spinny.Topspin: Can hit soft slow spinny tops but generates speed on faster loops with a lot of spin too.Blocking: I am not so skilled when it comes to blocks but could block easily and also active blocks/counter with some forward pressure were possible and very direct.Smashing: Did few and they all landed on the table, maybe just a litle slow..The sound of venus II is missing."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Well it was just a short test, but it will stay on my blade and I will report any changes"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"just to add it has higher throw angle than H3prov + tad more speed, not as good to chop with unlike H3."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,with the Moon the chops tend to go quite high and far
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The throw angle is higher then venus II, D. Acuda S2, and Palio Blitz.My current blade is 7ply hinoki with a mid-soft touch, not as soft as tanpan or speed 90.."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The blade does a BIG difference, thats why many have different findings regarding throw angle etc.I tried some flips against short tamahawk serves tonight."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,As this stroke is somethink I´ve never practice before I was kinda suprised that some of them landed on the table..
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Can anyone comment on Moon Pro's durability?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,How does it compare to Palio Thors?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I am interested in finding a replacement for my 6 month old sheet which is really lacking power.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Just noticed that TTNPP have quite a price difference between Moon and Moon Pro - $13 v $29.....
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,after two weeks (3 hours * 4 days a week) it is like new.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,topsheet is still shiny.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"(I am talking about Moon, not Moon pro)"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Which are the main differences between regular Moon and Moon Pro except the price..?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,moon pro is tacky
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,how good would it be at mid distance?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,probably not effortless like those high-speed-short-game-is-screwed rubbers like bryce speed.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,sigh...that class of rubbers only need a small fish and the ball lands on the table.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,its like im not doing anything at all.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"very good actually, with a fast carbon blade like wavestone.If you do have a fast carbon blade, then the only problem is smashing, which is much more difficult than with Sun."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,(Yesterday my smashes went to net a lot; everything else was better.)
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"So if you need more power, you need Sun, which is heavier, faster, less grippy, and higher throw."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,never the less with norma sun you can pull off some very spinny loops
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"mmm, i dont have any carbon in any of my blades whatsoever."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,what is it like on a five ply all wood blade that is fast allround in speed?if i bought a wavestone blade i wouldnt have money for the rubber.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I spoke too soon.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I now believe Moon 38deg max might be too quick and/or too hard on a fast carbon blade (unless you are very good  ) Yesterday I had control problems and I switched to Mercury2 37deg max, which gave me more spin and control.So I now believe Moon is best on a wooden blade."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,hows the durabilty on this ?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,either pro or normal
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"durability is ok as long as you dont take it off the blade too often, the sponge is rather easily damaged"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,My moon pro´s has been played for about 20 h and you can see the surface gettig used up a little.But the playing properties are still there..
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,YAr!!!!
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,LawOCG welcome back
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Hi guysCan anyone compare moon pro to mars 2 and mercury 2?- tackiness- weight- throw angleI play the soft version.Thanks.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,ercury much takier than moon.. the surface on the moon is also weird but moon is faster i believe
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,i have try out both ....
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Moon about 1 years and Moon pro for just 10 minutes when i post this .
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Moon pro are 39 deg while moon normal is 40deg .
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"most noticeable is the power increase, more lively and tacky surface ....my friend say my side spin services is noticeable spinner .... PS : more to test before write more..."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Yes, very good rubber."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Only durabillity........
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I ruined two of them (pro version) in 4 weeks: surface bubbles.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Right now i'm playing sun Pro.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Has wider pimples.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Also ruined one.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Just tried a new one.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I hope this one holds.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I really love this rubber.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"I'm now plying with black Tenergy 05 1,7mm and pretty happy with that.But the Moon Pro sound interesting to me."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Or maybe should I give the Palio Thor's an try?Do you think that I could give a try to the 1.8mm Moon Pro?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Is the 33° sponge not to soft comparing to the T05 sponge?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,hey guys..i play exclusively with blue whale II.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"recently ordered from TTNPP.com the blue whale III product..i also ordered a sheet of Moon Pro as well.. i have read some where that the purple or pink sponge is used by both whale III and the Moon Pro, i will soon find out and let everybody know what are the differences from all 3..whale 2 vs whale 3 vs moon pro..phamster"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,*GROAN*Went to look up this rubber on Eacheng's Aliexpress store.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Guess what.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,There are now THREE versions of Moon.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"First there's REGULAR Moon:http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product ... 03759.htmlThey say it's factory tuned, has ""Max Tense"" (whatever that is..), and 38-40 degree (I assume Chinese degrees) sponge."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,The sponge (for the red sheet) is red.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Then there's these two:http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product ... 09587.htmlhttp://www.aliexpress.com/store/product ... 24100.htmlCan someone tell me what the difference is between these two?
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The URL states that one is ""Factory Tuned"", the other is ""Max Tense""."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Then you go to the product pages, and it turns out they're BOTH Factory Tuned and they're BOTH Max Tense."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Grrr..
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"The only difference I can see is in the pictures - different logos on the free protector sheet, and one of them has that phallic looking gold sticker on it (that says it's factory tuned)."
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,And on neither do they state sponge hardness.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,I've only come across 33 degree sponge on one other (Chinese) rubber - Yasaka ZAP Spin.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"Apparently there's a Sun Pro as well, now:http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product ... 48245.htmlIskandar"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Just got a reply back from Eacheng's AliExpress store on an inquiry on the sponge hardness on the Moon Pro.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,"""now 39 degrees is available""Hmmm.. where would one find the 33 degree Moon (or Moon Pro)?"
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Maybe they don't make it any more.
57,5f6c2b127da9e46ccbe154b9,Galaxy / Yin-He Moon Pro,Iskandar
58,5f6c2b1c7da9e46ccbe154bf,Boost TS/TC,I used Boost TC on a Stiga Carbokev and it was an OK rubber.
58,5f6c2b1c7da9e46ccbe154bf,Boost TS/TC,Got it in a 2.0 which may have been a mistake.The Magna series are more dynamic and are discounted here...http://tabletennisequipment.dandoy-spor ... p?cPath=21Tried the Magna TC II on a Stiga All round Classic on both the BH & the FH and compared to Stiga Mendo Energy it transformed the blade and they were only in 2.0
58,5f6c2b1c7da9e46ccbe154bf,Boost TS/TC,"boost TS in my opinion suitable for attacking play , to spin , or to smash , so it's perfect for a full attacking and if you want to try it, I happen to sell Boost TS is only USD $ 42 and the method of payment by paypal ... you can see my post..viewtopic.php?f=10&t=25552thx u"
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I had a little look through your posts and was quite impressed with your jpen blog.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,For someone who has had little or no coaching you seem to be putting the effort into looking at how to improve.If you're dissatisfied with your FH rubber (I've no experience of jpen) you could consider sticking with the same rubber in a not so soft version - the Vega Europe.The Baracuda I wouldn't recommend - it's essentially an old rubber but for the Spin & Speed it gives it's not great on control.Genius Sound I know nothing about but it's rated at 37.5 degree compared to the 42.5 degree of the Baracuda.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Genius Sound is supposedly a very good rubber but a more up to date version of it would the 5Q sound at the same 37.5 degree.Haven't tried the 5Q sound but the 5Q is a super rubber but imagine it would be too advanced for you at this stage but it can work well for Shakehanders on both sides depending on the blade.There's also the Joola Maxxx 400 which I haven't tried.Safe option.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Vega EuropeTried and tested.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Genius Sound / Omega IV series Europe Up to date option.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,5Q soundTake a chance.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Joola Maxxx 400
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Thanks!
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I'm trying.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,"Coaching will be a big help, but the language barrier of the local TT center and the fact that I'm Jpen has me a bit cautious with the $ I invest."
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I had that on my radar as well!
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,"Many of the commenters on the TTDB mentioned the fact that it has a ""Big Window Effect""...not sure what that means."
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Is that a way of saying that it gives you a lot of room for error due to the arc?
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,What turned me off to it is the relatively low throw angle rating.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,It's not much different than the Vega Pro Elite that I have now.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,"Am I wrong in thinking that a higher throw angle results in a greater arc+spin, thus causing the ball to land sooner (And in turn further in from the edge of the table)?Thank you so much for your input!"
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Technically rated as a tensor and it seems it can be used / or was designed with speed glue in mind.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Using normal glue it should be fine.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,With a sheet costing €18 it might be worth a bash.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Could opt for a 2.0 This would be more lively than Vega Elite & Vega Europe.
59,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Has a medium throw.http://tabletennisequipment.dandoy-spor ... p?cPath=21
60,5f6c2b327da9e46ccbe154ce,Evolution vs 1Q/5Q?,The Tibhar evolution and Q series rubbers are high quality.
60,5f6c2b327da9e46ccbe154ce,Evolution vs 1Q/5Q?,I haven't used the R7S nor the 5QS but they seem similar but the R7S is the only one that's deemed a tensor.With a MX-P since it's hard it needs a medium composite blade but it does work well on a Nittaku Violin.
60,5f6c2b327da9e46ccbe154ce,Evolution vs 1Q/5Q?,From my experience with an EL-P I would have thought that a MX-P would be very durable.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Keep the new blade!
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"So im guessing by that response, its not a bad blade ?"
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,What about rubber ideas ?
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,?
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Would have to know more about what style you play and how well you play.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Do you know basic strokes or just learned on your own?
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Your blade is just fine because it is all round so you can play both defensive and offensive with it.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Thank your club mate for giving you one of the best all blades ever - ideal for advancing you style because of great control.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Not too fast either and that is a good thing for you.Get a pair of Yasaka Mark V rubbers or Butterfly Sriver and you'll be on your way.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Those are Euro style grippy rubbers.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,If you want to try Chinese tacky rubber get Friendship Cream transcend.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"Nicely balanced for all strokes, durable and very cheap."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Thickness of the sponge should be 1.8 - 2.0 mm.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"I did have a few coaching lessons from a few of the better club players, and learnt a few of the basic strokes, then took to watching videos on youtube (ping skills, and TT Uni + others) and praticing them in games... At the moment, I try and play a patient push / block game, and usually only try to attack when there is a good / easy opening."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"I have been told I have quite a good FH topspin, but my backhand topspin attack is better and more consistent."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"I have tried attacking when the ball is pushed long with back spin, but I struggle with this.. (partly due to lack of technique, but mostly because I cant get any lift on the ball with the pre-made bat.)"
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,This style works quite well against the mid ranked players where I play....
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"But I would like to be able to attack more, and in time take on the better players..."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,The Stiga with better rubbers will help looping backspin alot.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,There are too many rubbers to list but Shriver in 2mm is not a bad choice.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"If you want to have a good spinny looping game, I would go with 2mm or max."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"thanks everyone for the replies.After much hunting through various sites, UK and over seas."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,I have decided on a pair of Yasaka Mark V's.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"I was going to go with the sriver, but there seemed too many variations which confused me  and the Mk V's were a little cheaper."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"I ended up ordering them from the OOAK store, as it worked out about £15 cheaper than getting them domestically."
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,So hopefully should have them soon.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,"Can't wait.Again, thanks everyone"
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,You will have a very capable setup.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Stick with it.
61,5f6c2b3e7da9e46ccbe154d5,First Custom Bat / Racket rubbers,Just wondering if there was a big VAT bill from Customs.. Iskandar
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Yes AFAIK Kokutaku rubbers and Tulpe are made by the same Chinese manufacturer...I used to deal with them.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,What makes you think it's Korean?
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Really?
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"?I just ordered a rubber from one china site.. one site I found says it's a korean brand, but here's the site where I bought the rubber: http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z02.1.5864393.d4908585.KNMKmS&id=9938001722 Though the label says made in Japan, it also says designed for overseas but they used the term NATIONAL which usually pertains to chinese rubbers intended for their National Team.. some terms also were in German or Sweden language I guess."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,The images on the site was pretty neat so I got tempted to try it out.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Well I guess I still got some time to cancel the order.No wonder I don't find reviews about it.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Seems so legit on the pics.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"I can't see the ""made in Japan"" anywhere, or did I miss it?"
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"I can see the mention of ""Japan"", but that's not the same."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"It's a common trick for Chinese manufacturers to mention things like Japan, or Designed in Germany, etc, but this is just for marketing or making people think it's made in these countries, so that they'll pay more money for it."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"The word National is the same... they can design anything for the National team, but this dos not make it a rubber that's used by the National team."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"These were made in Tianjin China, this is the worst company for marketing with Tokyo, Taiwan, German and all sorts of names appearing on their rubbers"
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Is it Tulpe or Tuple?
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,I am confused with the way they spell  .
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National," and tuttle lol, I thinnnk one of those is German for Tulip"
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"I have seen both printed on products, I have a cheap 'tuple light' blade that I used when I first came back about 5 years ago and it is pretty decent, now use it for Hardbat."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"Yes I agree, their stuff is of decent quality, but it does put me off a little when they're obviously trying to make people think their stuff is made in Germany or Japan, to get more sales or get higher prices."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"I thought so too, pretty descent as it shows on the pics.. just don't know they aren't so popular in the US."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"perhaps they lack marketing, though the site carrying their product looks even more pretty descent than most online sites in the US by a margin.I'm still tempted to buy one rubber but later.. just to get the feel of it."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,looks like it's offering a different taste I've been craving for.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"It is definitely NOT Korean, even the Korean company Xiom has there rubbers made elsewhere."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"Yeah, I don't think Korea makes any rubbers at all, they make some good blades though!Getting back to the 868 National topic, I think there is a high chance that the 'National' means nothing... just marketing....and since the taobao has so much fake stuff, there is a good chance it's not even real."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"They could have just copied the pictures from the manufacturer.It's so easy to make a fake so-called National rubber... just take it out of the original package, put a stamp on the back and sell it at 10 x the price, and some people will buy it."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,i just tried a kokutaku 868 superlight.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,very tacky and very light rubber with very soft sponge.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,it is too much slow rubber.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,how can more speed?
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,with booster?
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Bet it will be a rocket on a T-8 blade.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"Yes with a booster (not legal for competition of course), or as Der_Echte mentioned, a fast blade."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,exactly what will NOT be a rocket on a T8 blade:)
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"We all go a little silly when we see a rubber we know and the manufacturer adds any of the following words: Provincial, National, Pro etc."

62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"One shop even listed them as ""Tulpe/Tuple""."
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,"Yeah, there's some sort of blurb on some of the packets that claim the rubber was developed jointly by some Japanese research outfit (called Kokutaku) and the Tianjin Tuttle company (doesn't 729 come from Tianjin too?"
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Then again maybe Tianjin is like Akron..?).
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,Some of their blades have a big picture of tulips silk-screened on the face of the blade.

62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,This must be one of the first.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,It is not cheap by Chinese rubber standard.
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,How is it play?
62,5f6c2b5f7da9e46ccbe154e4,Korean/TULPE Rubber: Kokutaku 868 National,What's a T8 blade?

63,5f6c2b7a7da9e46ccbe154f4,Rasant or Bluefire m2 for FH,They are almost the same rubber but I felt M2 less bouncy than rasant.
63,5f6c2b7a7da9e46ccbe154f4,Rasant or Bluefire m2 for FH,"You could give either a go, you would probably find either suit an attack game fairly similarly."
63,5f6c2b7a7da9e46ccbe154f4,Rasant or Bluefire m2 for FH,Rasant is marginally faster and a lighter rubber than M2 so you might prefer it or you could also have a look at Rasant Turbo.

64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Good topic.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,My suggestion would be to keep it cheap and relatively slow.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"No doubt the Rubber Experts will give more specific recommendations, but the path I took was pretty good: Chinese rubbers like Friendship (about A$15 each)."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Friendship Cream Transcend.Cheep Chinese tacky rubber.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Great control, average spin and speed, solid durability.All things consider, I thing this is the best choice for beginner (on some well known all blade).There are lots of nice rubbers for first custom setup but not this cheap."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Dawei Superpower and Friendship 729 fx.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Although I'm a big fan of Chinese rubbers, the transition to non-chinese rubbers (if they need to) can be hard, as the stroke is different.One issue I also do have with Chinese rubbers is that some are quite inconsistant, which can slow down their progress a little.I think Sriver / Mark V and similar rubbers (most brands have one) is still a very good choice to teach them the right technique."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I agree with haggisv on the Sriver/Mark V thing.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I can also vouch for the Dawei 2008 Superpower XP.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"+1 for Palio CJ8000 Biotech from me - solid all-around series, suitable for both FH+BH, and very affordable (about $10 per side)."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Good spin, a bit tacky, average weight, and not too fast."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Few versions with different hardness are available, so you can pick one (or two ;]) matching your blade, skill and style of play."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Beginners should start 36-38° 1.8 or 2.0mm (lowest speed, more controlled play), but more experienced player who can generate enough speed in hand might like it, too  (especially on BH, and/or on a faster blade)."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I lucked out with the first rubber I ever played being Nittaku Magic Carbon.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Absolutely perfect for a young player.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Unfortunately I've only seen it in one place for a long time and that's tabletennis11.com.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,First choice should be mark v imho.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,You need to put money second in the early days because the first days are the most important.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"If that's not possible I quite like Mars ii, dawei xp 2008 superpower, for a tacky rubber although I wouldn't start a player on it unless they themselves felt it was better than a non tacky, in that case friendship 729 and globe 999 are suitable along with a couple of the dhs rubbers."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Magic carbon too is good and nittaku also do a rubber especially for younger players but I've lost its name in the old brain at the moment.If you were to start by our own kid playing like I hope to in a few years well its got to be mark v.For the kids that don't want to spend much at the club I usually do a Chinese 5 ply with either dawei 2008 xp both sides or on the bh with 729fx on forehand.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"6 months to first 2 yearsMark V-Forehand, for all strokes, only 1.8 mm recommended(defenitely not max rubbers)Friendship- backhand, beginners could play only counters and pushThe above combination is recommended after 3-6 months of regular play."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,For entry level beginner readymade bats from butterfly like addoy or butterfly D13 rubbers.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,These rubbers are forgiving and very good for pushes and blocks.could be used for first 6 months.Once they start learning how to brush and generate spin with these rubbers they could graduate to medium thickness rubbers.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,to me having a slightly softer handhand rubber is better others think simalar both sides also hard Cheap Chinese rubber could be suitable for forehand learning but not so good on the backhand as it is reactive to spin and a different stroke compared to forehand so med hard Chinese forehand in 2mm and something like focus 111 or 729 Fx in thinner sponger is about right
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I was always given hand me down Euro and Jap rubbers as I was starting out.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Mostly Sriver and MarkV sheetsI have seen Hexer used as a beginner rubber and on an ALL blade I think that would be ok. Its not what I would call a super fast rubber.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,But then I think that blade has more impact on your set up then rubber choice as a beginner.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,MARK V - I don't think it should be recommended because it is difficult to control pushes and other touch shots.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"I would disagree here, I think that Mark V is fine for these shots."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Considering that you will develop the techniques anyway with training, proper form will not require an equipment compensation."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Also being so slow compared to what all new rubbers are and much less bouncy I think that the Mark V is perfect for learning with.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,We all know that beginners are different than developing players.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"So I think most of your suggestions are great for developing players, and perhaps something a bit slower like Reflectoid is well suited for beginners.I agree with LOOPOVER that Mark V could be a bit fast for pushes and hitting for a beginner."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Reflectiod is great, that's one I missed but really good soft first rubber on the cheap."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Also lkt rapid sound is a good non tacky soft rubber.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I wonder what we mean by beginner or developing player?
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I agree.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Mark V is excellent for learning proper blade angles.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,What I don't like is when starters are suggested something on the premise that it is spin insensitive.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Young players need to understand proper blade angles.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,You can't learn that with spin insensitive rubbers.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Baal for me this thread is about your first hit of a ball.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Sometimes by the stage you've hit a couple of years with a slippery pre made its too late.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Baal asked:I think what is intended is that a developing player has a bit more experience than a beginner.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"If a beginner decides to pursue the sport by playing more regularly, then he is considered a developing player."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,The beginner says: what is the basics?
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Te developing player says: Now that I understand the basics, how do I improve from here?"
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,There is total beginner and developing player.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I think it is not the same.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Total beginner is someone who never held a paddle.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,When I started few years ago seriously I had some previous experience with premade bats (here and there during a long period of time).
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Rubbers recommended here were just fine for me (and still are).
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I think for total beginner most of rubbers recommended are too fast.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Played with Mark V for same time and it is not a slow rubber.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I used it in 2.0mm.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Maybe 1.5 mm is totally different (slow and more control).
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Well since I've moved back to inverted from SP on my BH after 2.5 years, it's pretty much a developing player's backhand again...I found Butterfly Solcion to be excellent!"
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"Of course Sriver and Mark V will always be great, but weight was an issue for me coming from 1.5mm sponge"

64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Mark V would be good for 1200-1600 or thereabouts IMHO.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Baal said: Mark V would be good for 1200-1600 or thereabouts IMHO.I agree!
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I think that Mark V is too fast for players who are much lower than that level.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"CJ8000 is the easiest sheet i've tried so far..lots of control, medium speed, insensitive to spin, yet the spin is better than sriver."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,One of the fellows I played on Monday night had that on both sides of his bat.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,My observation was that it was very heavy!
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,that depends on the thickness of the sponge.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,Beginning Level players probably should stick with 1.5-1.8 sponges.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,I played for at least five years before progressing to thinker rubber than 1.5mm.
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,"This was with the 38mm ball, 1.8 is the equivalent now."
64,5f6c2b847da9e46ccbe154f9,Top 10 beginner / developing player rubbers,As a developing and teenage player I just didn't generate the power to need a thicker rubber than that.

65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,Some of Chinese rubbers are only slightly tacky  (e.g.

65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,If money is no object it would be T05 on forehand and probably T64 or T80 for backhand.
65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,Non-tacky rubber can create lots of spin too.

65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,Perhaps it's the blade-rubber combination.
65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,Moved away from Chinese rubber mainly due to the need to speedglue regularly.

65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,The answer is yes to both questions.
65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,H3 commercial is popular here due to low price but is dead and hard as rock without speed glue; practically need to glue every time before play.
65,5f6c2bad7da9e46ccbe15511,Chinese tacky or Euro / Japanese non-tacky?,The H3 provincial blue sponge is much softer and lighter; can cut down gluing frequency to once a month.

66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,+1 Skyline TG3 Neo is (imo) MUCH less demanding in comparison to H3N and tad more versatile.Best choice is to buy commercial pieces (it's relatively cheap so you can try H3N AND TG3 - better to start with TG3).
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Because tacky rubbers are really different to ESN ones.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,It's not for everyone.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"(better footwork and timing is required) - just don't go with expensive provincial, blue sponged or national ones."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,You can try these after liking commercial ones !What is more just forget about bosting : ) Get used to untuned rubbers.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,You can tune when 1800+.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I think they're not bad choices...
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I would suggest H3N forehand and TG2N backhand on a wooden blade not too fast (all+ to OFF-).Tacky rubber do require a somewhat different stroke to non-tacky rubbers, but there's nothing wrong with learning how to play with them."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I know that those questions doesnt fit here but could you guys please answer them for me ?Which one should I buy for those rubbers ?-Should be good for topspins near the table,not too stiff, good for spinny serves and please not too fast.Xiom Magellan / JazzBTY Primorac / Primorac ClassicBTY Timo Boll all+ / off-And my second question would be.How should I train to develop a good topspin stroke and footwork like the Chinese player ?By the way, are those rubbers like the Sanwei Gears cause if I remember correctly, its also an chinese rubber,right ?Thanks for answering my questions and sorry for the off-topic."

66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,1#No one of them.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I suggest Avalox P500.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Same price range and much better performance for Chinese rubbers.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Primorac with H3 feels like cartoon box.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I think Timo Boll all+ will be simillar.2#Yes, you have to  It's good idea to watch a lot of videos of Chinese technique on yt."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"The variety of Chinese rubbers is at least as great as those Japanese or German rubbers... so NO, not all Chinese rubbers are like Gears"
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I'm currently using TG2N and H3N on Xiom Offensive S and I really like it.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"The way you described it, it looks like our styles are similar too, so I can recommend this."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Don't get fooled by the rating of the blade, it's probably more like Off-, so definitely not too fast even for beginners."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Then it is probably going to be a Xiom Offensive S H3N for forehand and TG2N for backhand.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,BTW I cant find Avalox in Thailand .Still a little bit afraid that the XOS is too fast for me
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Not to worry, there is the XIOM Allround S, slower than the Offensive S"
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Chinese style rubbers are slow at slow strokes, so OFF blade should not very too fast for beginner."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,But I recommend ALL blades for better feel.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Power is not important for beginner.Both sides of Chinese rubbers could be too heavy combination, so I recommend something lighter like LKT Rapid Speed on BH."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"My setup is kinda on the heavy side with 186g, but the blade alone weighs 90g, so with a lighter one, he should be ok."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,The allround version should be 10g lighter.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I'm going to buy the H3N and the TG2N but I have doubts on where should I place it.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"You suggested to put the H3N on the forehand and the TG2N on the backhand, why is that?"
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Why do I see pro players using H3N on backhand while they use rubbers from the TGN series on forehand, I'm wondering because when I see them play they usually use their black rubber most of the time."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Please help, Thank you!"
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I'm playing us 2000+ with TG3 and my little friends around 1200-1600 us are also using it.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I would probably use TG3 on forehand and H2 on backhand if I had to choose fh and bh from that series.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"+1, TG3 forhand."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I found H3N a good backhand rubber.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Would it be better to use TG2N on forehand than TG3N?
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,They say that they it has more speed and I also saw it has a higher ratings
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"More speed, spin and lower throw."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Why don't you try the Galaxy 896 with the TG3 on the forehand and the H3N on the backhand, this would be a could set up if you want to loop better."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"The 896 has a soft feeling combined with the hard sponge of the rubber, but practice is everything."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Does anyone agree or disagree, correct me if I'm wrong."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Vladimr
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"The 896 is a horrible blade, I've had a few of them and all were stiff and hard."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I gave all of them away.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Hi guys, I want to try any of these rubbers."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I´m and advanced players +2100 and i´ve been playing with Grip SE last year.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I quit playing GSE because of quality issues so I want to give it a try a sheet of these commercial before betting on prov/nat versions.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"So far, a friend of mine borrowed a spare sheet of TG3 Blue sponge tuned with two layer of falco tempo long, but honestly, didn´t like that much."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,It was soooo lively and bouncy and not as spinny as my former GSE when brushing looping.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I also felt that throw ball was son annoying for me, too high."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I want something as close to my former GSE, but not slower or less spinnier."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,What do you recommend me H3/TG3?
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Is that Blue sponge so diffent from regular orange neos?
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Try h2 neo without tuner if you prefer lower throw.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I am also a beginner.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I just want to warn you, I started out using a off blade and fast rubber."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,It was total chaos!
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I had no control at all!!
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Do not make the same mistake as I did.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,I went and got Instinct Blade - and 729 FX-C Rubbers on both sides.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Made it very smooth for me to learn my strokes.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Within a week, I felt like it was too slow, so I moved up to 729 Transcend Cream 2.0 on both sides."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Now it is perfect speed, I really feel my game improving every day!"
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"I still strongly recommend starting out with 729 FX-C(to get the fundamentals first) , then move up."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"All of these are very cheap, and great way to start out."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,Before moving on more expensive high speed rubbers and blades.
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"So look for an ALL blade, cheap chinese rubber with good control and not too fast."
66,5f6c2bd07da9e46ccbe15528,DHS Hurricane (neo) /Skyline (neo) for beginners,"Thats my 2 cents , Good luck"
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,You can never be sure that they're REAL unless you buy direct from DHS.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,"According to DHS themselves, over 90% of the Provincial/National DHS rubbers on the market are fakes.Some of the stores you mentioned may well think their rubbers are genuine, but it all depends on the reliability of their supplier.Alienexpress is more of a chain of Chinese stores, and is probably the least reliable of those mentioned below, as I've seen many fakes on their sites, and they're often not even hiding this fact."
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I must be an idiot.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I like chinese rubbers.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I have tried a lot of chinese rubbers.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I can find at least one good thing about almost all of them.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I have tried 3 or 4 sheets of H3 (tried both neo and regular sponge) and can't find a single good thing about H3.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I know a lot use it.....
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,"I can't image how much better the provincial or national versions are than the junky commercial versions I have tried.Disclaimer-even though I tried H3 back in the speed glue era, I never more than lightly speed glued H3 (and don't currently tune or anything) but that is the only thing I may have done different."
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I can't understand the H3 fascination.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,You're not the only one vanjr...
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,I can't get it to work for my game either.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,The speed to spin ratio just does not seem right for my strokes.
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,Thx for the reply iv used a real neo H3 national before nothing compares at all t energy 05 spin is little to itfor it to work u need the right technique ofc and use the explosion power some people just can't use itiv been using it for about 5 years love it  i tryed using the euro rubbers of forehand doesn't work the same haggisv and vanjr Thx
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,"Hello,Living now in Hk I've switched back to chinese rubber after training in great China.I understood I should never had listen french coach asked me to use bty or donic rubber.I,ve played with many 999 before sticking a long time with tenergy.Now i use the normal H3 without glue in 38°.I probably today play my best table tennis ever.Will as well retry 999."
67,5f6c2c167da9e46ccbe15553,H3 Neo Provincial or national BS or not where to buy?,But H3 is destroyer on carbon blade (klhs or viscaria).Brahms
68,5f6c2c197da9e46ccbe15555,Fh rubber for attacking / chopping on Defplay,I have the same blade as you with long pips on the backhand.
68,5f6c2c197da9e46ccbe15555,Fh rubber for attacking / chopping on Defplay,I recently switched to Xiom Vega Japan 2.0mm and find it perfect for this type of game.
68,5f6c2c197da9e46ccbe15555,Fh rubber for attacking / chopping on Defplay,It chops incredibly well for a faster offensive rubber.
68,5f6c2c197da9e46ccbe15555,Fh rubber for attacking / chopping on Defplay,It also loops and smashes great.
68,5f6c2c197da9e46ccbe15555,Fh rubber for attacking / chopping on Defplay,I can't recommend it enough.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,If you have good pictures and know what the real rubbers look like you can tell the obvious fakes but you can never be 100% sure.Now for my important point and that is.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,Im playing at a reasnoble level using ordinary commercial rubber and also its not limiting me at all actually Ive probably got a stronger and more consistant forehand than anyone in my division so you dont need worry about special rubbers.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,I actually play just the same with any cheap hard rubber.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,Its not as important as a good blade and certainly not as important as muscle control from practice.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,"Ah, don't worry about it - I wasn't intending to purchase, it's just something that has been piquing my interest for a while.Do the provincial and national rubbers *look* different to the commercial versions, then?"
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,I have been told provincial will be cut into 6 sides... Commercial 8 sides and national 4 sides... Not sure if its true.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,The player told me it had to do with where the rubber comes from on the big sheet that they cut.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,Not sure if its true.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,They also have the sticker serial number things that I know nothing about but that there was a thread before about.Good luck.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,That's right about the side cuts but the fakes can be any shape they decide to cut them and the authenticity sticker can be fake too.
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,"The best way to tell is see if the overall rubber, sponge, sponge stamp and packet all look correct for what its supposed to be."
69,5f6c2c487da9e46ccbe15573,How can you prove a DHS rubber to be prov/national?,In the end you just buy the commercial from a dhs reseller and you are all good.If you can look at a provincial or national in person you can see they are as little softer but often commercial sheets are soft too.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"I've only used Baracuda and none of the others (R7, S2)."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"It is a very good intermediate high throw rubber, and if you ever want to use something like Tenergy, it is a stepping stone in that direction."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,It's speed makes it better mostly for close to the table play.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"When buying rubbers, my advice to someone your age is to buy what you plan to use for the long term as you tend to learn everything quickly if you play a lot."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,I've tried S2.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,It is a little ho-hum but perfectly fine for a player up to at least 2000.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,I haven't used Barracuda but most people tend to speak well of it.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"Baracuda and S2 don't differ very much, but the Baracuda is somewhat spinner, while the S2 plays a bit flatter."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"If your game is all about looping, I'd go with Baracuda."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"If you mix it up more with drives and blocking, S2."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"Both are slower than Rakza 7, but you probably get a bit more control."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"I have played with razka 7, acuda s2 and baracuda ( big slam and baracuda )."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,I go with Baracuda.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,Easier to control.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,I prefer Baracuda than Baracuda BS though.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,Acuda has no big difference with Baracuda.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,I used s2 all season last year on my backhand.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,It was a bit fast for me but I could off and on hit some amazing shots with it.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,Before that I had hexer on the backhand which is supposed to be the same rubber with a different name to baracuda and hexer was spinnier than s2.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"S2 was flatter, still they are very similar rubbers."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,I currently use barracuda 1.8 black on backhand.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"Ive glued it on a xiom hayabusa zx which is off.I like it very much,i can push very good with it,its exellent at looping and easy to block with because Its not very spin sensitive."
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,Flat hitting is no problem for me and i have good control on the short play.I have not used acuda but i have used rakza 7 soft.
70,5f6c2c647da9e46ccbe15584,Donic Acuda S2 or Baracuda,"The rakza is also a very good rubber,it has more speedThan the barracuda and for me the extra catapult of rakza made do to many errors in short play and serve reciving."

72,5f6c2c8d7da9e46ccbe1559d,Do Hard Chinese Rubbers work better on hard or soft blades?,"The only problem with balsa cores is that you struggle for power away from the table, here you just need to think about how far from the table you need to play, if your at a level where you don't go back more than a couple meters in general offensive play then a balsa core will be ok, maybe even the best choice."

72,5f6c2c8d7da9e46ccbe1559d,Do Hard Chinese Rubbers work better on hard or soft blades?,Then you can really attack the ball which makes it easier to clear the net and the ball also curves a lot which makes it hard for the opponent.
72,5f6c2c8d7da9e46ccbe1559d,Do Hard Chinese Rubbers work better on hard or soft blades?,I'm pretty good with that shot in practice but don't use it in matches out of bad habbit.
72,5f6c2c8d7da9e46ccbe1559d,Do Hard Chinese Rubbers work better on hard or soft blades?,Anyway you can do it fine with that blade.
72,5f6c2c8d7da9e46ccbe1559d,Do Hard Chinese Rubbers work better on hard or soft blades?,thank you sir.

73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I don't think the 3 * II is a lot different to the 9000E.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Not bad rubbers, tacky with a fairly firm sponge and decent speed."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,They worked really well with speed glue.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Good for the price, but there's a lot better out there!"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Good rubber , I'd say more gears than Hurricanes."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Spinny , high throw and bouncy enough."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Not feelin' dead.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Heavy and lacks quality control though.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Could be very tacky or milldy tacky , depends the batches."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,For instance?
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Depends on what you want it to do.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I would say both Mars and Venus are better in the Milky Way range for speed and durability to start with.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Most the 729 rubbers like MRS Cream, Higher III, Focus II and the Transcend SP."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Dawei IQ and IQUL and the other normal inspirit rubbers.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,The list goes on and depends on the price you want to pay as well.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I said the 9000 was good for its price, I didn't mean there was a myriad of better rubbers at that price."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I like the 9000 3 star as I have used it.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I have not tested the Venus and Mars.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I have been meaning to try out Cream MRS and SP Transcend.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I'm not a fan of japanese/euro rubbers on my forehand and I would like something with a built in glue effect.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"If those are similar then by all means, I will give them a shot but out of all the rubbers I've tried; I like the 9000E the best and the 9000 3 star is similar and has a built in glue effect."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,To make things extremely simple: A light-ER weight TRADITIONAL CHINESE rubber with a built in glue effect that is similar to the 9000 3 star II.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,The only thing I've heard with a glue effect that even remotely has a tacky top is LKT rapid Power/Speed
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,http://oneofakindtrading.com.au/3_star_ii1.htm states that it has some kind of glue effect.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,so does eacheng.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"The way I red it is that its designed for speed glue, not glue effect."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Also I tried the galaxy 9000E.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Of all the 9000's there at hyqua now, this was the only one that interest me other than the 3*."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Actually, I like it better cause it isn't reverse tensioned."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,If you glue I'd get this one.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,If you don't I'd get the 3*.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"The sponge is 40deg, green, and once broke in it is as loud as any I have."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Very tacky.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"If you go to the rubber reviews section then go to Yinhe and look at the comments, thats what it says."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I know, we are talking past each other."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"They are talking about glue effect as the rubber being speed glued to the blade, and what I am talking about is ""inbuild glue effect"" like the tensors are and Tenergy."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Pretty much rubbers designed to take advantage of the speedglue ban.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,9000 II 3 * has no glue effect.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,It has enough power to play without gluing.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"It is hard , tacky , high-throw and is springier than Hurricanes."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,It is very sensitive to incoming spin though.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,It is like Transcend SP IMO
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Actually none of the galaxy/yin-he rubbers are reverse tensioned as far as I know... All come pretty much flat out of the package...
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Would you say it as as good or better than those you mentioned or subpar?
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Would there be significantly better alternatives.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"In terms of weight, which of these would be the lightest?"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I hold a 3*II (and a Venus 36-38') in my hands right now and I can say that the sponges feel the same-flexible and rather soft for a typical chinese one, softer than Higher Transcend, very close to HigherIII."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"The top sheet of 3*II is very tacky and with a glossy look on it(Venus is dull and almost non-tacky and already looks old, though I've used it exactly 5min) The 3*II weighs 47gr, the Venus 44."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I played the 3*II on my Iolite, KC and Tube Carbo and I have only one description - A SPINNING machine."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Very consistent looper , maybe the best opening loops of all the chinese rubbers I own."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Effortless and spinny.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"The speed wasn't something to talk about, again close to HigherIII The control is among the best."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Due to the softer feel the smash wasn't too impressive.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I won't say that there is any speed glue feel in it, tension-maybe......still, I keep this rubber for times when I get bored with my BH(chinese)rubbers and enjoy every spiny moment with it."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"BTW, I never got to like the Venus that much, though it is faster"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Thank you for your spectacular input.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Would you consider it better and/or faster than Cream MRS or Transcend?
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I have Cream on Saviga and ......nothing to roar about.Heavy, slow, kind a mushy and no spin nor smash enough for me.On MRS or Transcend maybe different though.The batch of 3*II I have is way better for my kind of game(spin spin spin) but we know, the quality may vary quite a bit"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I think the 3* I got wasn't as good as what you got.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"It wasn't terrible, but not as spinny or tacky as you describe."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"As you say, the QC could easily account for this."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"For its price, its a good value rubber."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,EJ's is stirring to try the lucky dip and see if I get a better one!
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Oh, was yours black or red Kolev?"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Mine was red, typically less tack!"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Reborn, the quality varies."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I had a pair like Kolev said , SPINNING machine."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,What blade did you have them on Vali?
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Mine is black and last night i glued it on my Carbon Extreme together with Nimbus on the other side and I can confirm what i've already writen , even more-I don't think of the 3*II as a slow rubber any more(chinese standarts), but there is always a downside- the weight increased and I noticed that my fast and slow game are good, but no medium feeling."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,(after the Aces and 999EN every rubber seems heavy to me)
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Stiga Clipper , Samsonov Carbon, Jonyer Hinoki , Mazunov as far as I remember"
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Has anyone tried the Three-nine blue lucifer 999 to compare to 3*?
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I think the Blue lucifer is very spinny.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"Not so fast though, although could still hit with it reasonably."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"This is a super old thread, but I figured I would post anyways.I just ordered a globe 999t on air lemon sponge (from colestt) to mess with, and while I'm waiting I dug through my pile of old rubbers."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I realized I had a 9000 3 star 2 laying that was almost brand new.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I bought it probably 5 years ago when I first started playing and it was way to fast/sensitive for me at the time so I only used it for probably 3 days and its been in storage ever since.I slapped it on my wavestone (probably not the best blade for it... but what the hey).
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"I've been playing with cj8000 biotech on a k4..... so thats whats most familiar and thats my reference point at the moment.I didn't spend to much time with it, but against the robot:- Top spin seemed to have plenty of spin and would dip faster than cj8000."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,"It was easier to hit the table when really wack'n the ball.- It was pretty quick on the wavestone... too quick for my taste, especially when trying to do slow pushes with lots of backspin..."
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Probably a mix of it being so tacky and fast.- Looping heavy backspin was cake (very easy).
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,Way way easier than with cj8000.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I guess I forgot how easy it can be sometimes... crazy stuff.I didn't spend much time with it but I thought I would do a quick post just for fun.
73,5f6c2c9b7da9e46ccbe155a6,Galaxy/Yinhe 9000 3 Star II,I'll probably move it to my K4 and play with it until my 999 gets here... just for fun

Definitely heavier in spin than T05, perhaps by about 25%... Other non-Chinese rubbers that can produce roughly the same amount of spin as T05 in serves and pushes are Calibra LT, Acuda S1, Stiga Boost TP and Yasaka Rakza 7... Maybe T05 could push heavier than these, but I do not feel it from Zaman M. or Justin N... As a matter of fact I have never felt T05 users could overpower me with extra spin than most other non-Chinese inverted..."

Now if T05 users feel they can produce spin easier (and with better control) than its competitors, that could very well be true, but there's definitely a ceiling on this rubber's spin capability that I feel is not superior to many rubbers out there."

75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,I agree with RR.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,The kinds of underspin that some of our Chinese coaches get with Chinese rubbers is truly remarkable.

75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,Maybe it is just because it is much spinny than it looks rather than being more spinny in absolute terms.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"Or maybe it is because I can really dig hard when I push with short spin-pips, especially on return of serve, and still know the ball is going where i want it."

75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"05 Is a great serving rubber, others I found great were rakza7 and Stiga lt spin I think 05 with a thinner sponge would be pretty good at pushing downspin, I did swap bats with a mate once as he chops off both sides using inverted and could create great backspin with the Rakza7 it really supprised me, as all I was doing was seeing if he liked lp's lol"
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,Tenergy 05 1.7 gets my vote.

75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,I wonder why nobody mentioned Baracuda and Baracuda BigSlam.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,IMO these rubbers beats Tenergy on push and serve mainly due to its vicious spin.I found Magna TX II a lot spinnier than any of the Calibras on push and serves.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,Yinhe Moon is also my favorite on push and serves.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"I haven't tried the Tenergy series much, but I've played with Calibra LT and Calibra LT Sound.I'm now using the Xiom Omega IV Elite which I picked specifically for its high spin rating on tabletennisdb.comI have to say, it feels incredibly spinny."
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"I get a load of underspin on serves, pushes and over the table chops, which feels likes one of its greatest assets."
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"It also gets plenty of topspin on loops and twiddled backhand strokes, though possibly not as much as the Tenergy 05FX I've played with briefly."
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"I've only got the 1.8mm sponge rather than max, not sure if that has a difference.On a quicker blade with max sponge I reckon the Omega IV Elite would give most top-end rubbers a run for their money in terms of spin."
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,I dont get to play against them very often so I don't dual get to see it from the other guys perspective.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"But when I do, I find the dhs tackys ridiculosly heavy pushes from some players than have good ball contact."
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,But a good player like carbonman gets even more spin than that with normal tensors.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,So the quality of the players ball contact seems the major factor.

75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,"There is this guy who plays with a thin sponge and he has the heaviest pushes I know.But then even though its not Chinese rubber, it is Chinese ""style"" tacky rubber.On the European style, I am yet to play against a rubber that generates more underspin on pushes than my T05."

75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,I know it's a little off topic but a guy at my club (approx US2250-2300) once had a brief hit with Jiang Jialiang.
75,5f6c2ca77da9e46ccbe155ae,Which Euro/Jap rubber beats Tenergy for pushing/serving?,He said the amount of spin he got with SP on his serves and pushes was just ridiculous.
76,5f6c2cbf7da9e46ccbe155c0,How does Joola turbo compare to mark V/sriver?,I just looked up Joola Turbo on http://www.tabletennisdb.com/rubber/This website provides an AWESOME database of rubbers and blades with many ratings on the rubbers.The Joola Turbo is rated a 6/10 on speed and a 6/10 on spin.
76,5f6c2cbf7da9e46ccbe155c0,How does Joola turbo compare to mark V/sriver?,"It sounds like it would be a bit slower than Mark V, Sriver and quire a bit slowe than Coppa."
76,5f6c2cbf7da9e46ccbe155c0,How does Joola turbo compare to mark V/sriver?,"In my humble opinion, Sriver is about a 6 on spin, but MarkV and Coppa are about 8.Hope this helps"

78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,for a topspin style game... the Rasant seemed to have more speed than spin when you start looping harder.

78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,Maybe Tibhar 5Q or Donic Bluefire M2 could be a good compromise for you.

78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,I can only say how good the Rasant is.
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,I can make mad loops with it that I have never been able to do with any other rubber.
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"I don't use these in my game generally because its not something that fits in, but I've done it in practice and have been totally amazed how much you really can spin the ball up with it!"

78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,But I didn't felt that much deference from Hexer HD to change.
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,Problem with HD is that has no feel to it .
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"So far I could collect info On 1Q XD it seems like its a lot more feel to it than Rasent or HD, still in process off making decision"
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"Personally, I thought there was a fairly big difference between Rasant and HD."
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"HD felt heavy and as you say ""no feel""."
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"And I couldn't get the speed out of it that I could with Hexer plus, which is much slower and less spinny than Rasant."

78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,Yes HD is heavy like T05 and I like that.
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,As well I get plent speed and spin to be honest each week it actualy playing with it is much better.
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,I don't now about 1Q XD thats why was hoping that someone had played with and share some info about it.
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,Someone please
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"I think the Rasant and the 5Q are nearly the same, but in my opinion, the 5Q´s surface is better."
78,5f6c2cca7da9e46ccbe155c6,Tibhar 1Q XD or Andro Resant on Forehand,"If you compare both, you will see, that the Rasant´s surface is more matt and the 5Q more shining and seems to have more grip."

80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Sorry.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Please resume normal transmission.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,There is a relatively recent thread somewhere on OOAK where Rasant is compared to T05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Opinions between these two appear divided.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Some like Foam prefer Rasant whilst others claim it lacks the spin of T05 and is inferior for looping.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I'm not sure about Bluefire but I'm sure it is compared to death with T05 at one of the TT blogging sites.I think a lot comes down to what standard you are.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,If you are below 2000 or so it ain't going to make much difference so go with the cheapest one.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I played the last tournament with Rasant on my backhand, ultimately it's too fast for me but it makes a lot of spin with the speed and has enough grip to do just about anything you want against serve, if you have the confidence to use it how it want's to be used and that's something very important with this rubber."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I use a tacky rubber on the forehand and prefer that over any Tensor or T05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Rasant is not especially good for my forehand stroke just like T05 isn't especially good.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I just find Rasant ""less not good"" .I also perceive it makes more spin than T05 when playing against them."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"That could be just because I'm so used to playing against T05.. then again I see balls coming off Rasant do some very strange things at times on the bounce that I haven't seen happen since speed glued 38mm balls so I'm sure it's making a lot of spin.One thing is that Rasant is harder to control than T05 because it's bouncier and faster, Bluefire is just slightly different to Rasant, not different enough to write the story twice"
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thanks foam.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,That surely helps.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I am hoping someone who really likes T05 and is a current T05 or T64 user will review Bluefire.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Not many comments from people like that.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Someone send me a sheet and I'll tell you how I feel it plays as I am explicitly loving my t05 and t05fx
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,This is exactly the output I am expecting but I was not able to communicate it sufficiently.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I love playing my T64 and when I tried using Samba +, I am not satisfied with the topspin speed."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,T64 is pricey.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I am looking for equivalent rubber that plays exactly like tenergy 64 and 05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thanks Baal for clarifying.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Petermoo has a review an compares it to T05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"But he doesn't use T05 or like it very much, so even though he is a good player, for me it is not that useful, at least not by itself."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,He says they have some of the same feel.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I would be more confident if several people who were really looking for that unique T05 feel would try Bluefire.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Red, having used T64 only briefly before, and having used T05 somewhat more, I think Rasant carries the best of both worlds of those rubbers."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Its a beast in being able to spin up the ball in Tenergy fashion, but remains fast when hitting with less spin and more slap...more along the T64 line, less along the T05 line (I found T05 to be quite slow when slapping)."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I have switched to Rasant from Hexer Plus on my main setup simply because I like the feel of Rasant more and I get more spin from it in almost every situation...and more speed.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Its not a huge difference to Hexer Plus in feel, and I feel they are almost interchangeable for me, but Rasant just feels slightly more polished somehow."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I haven't used T64 enough to compare them point for point, but I don't think Rasant loses out to it in any way from what I recall of T64 (it has been a while)."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I had the same thought...so I have changed the title of the thread to avoid confusion for others.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thanks Reb for the share and for correcting the title  .
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Today I had a 5 minute hit with a friends bat - Tenergy 05 on one side and Rasant on the other (I think the blade was one of those silly 2 foot thick TSP balsa thingys).
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,All I did was loop against block and I must say they appeared (to me at least) very very similar.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,MAYBE T05 has a touch more spin but I wouldn't put any money on it.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Rasant certainly appears to be good value for money.btw - I'm not a regular Tenergy user.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Ok I just sold my unused but new GFX card and have some cash to spend, I think that I'm going to check out the Rasant and Bluefire in 2.1 and 2.0mm respectively."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I should have them by next week on the blade with some hours in play.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I'll compare it to my T05fx that I've got on now although I think that they may be a tad to fast for my current blade at least Ill be able to compare the 3 kinds of rubbers that are listed in the thread and on the one rig...
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I will be testing an Orange, Blue and Green sponge..."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Wow.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Finally a complete review
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Haha yeah, Something like that."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I do think that the Bluefire will be better for me from what other people on the interwebs have been saying about Bluefire and Rasant.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,But then again you really have to have a go at it to see what works.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I like the T05fx a lot, so I should be able to see what the feel difference is between the 3 and give a comparison from a tenergy users perspective."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I'm looking for a replacement for the Joola Express Two I have on my BH, as I dont like the feel of it, not enough touch and dwell for me compared to the T05fx when I swap between the two for testing, it also feels less spinny on the loops or serves."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"So what ever the better rubber is, bluefire or rasant, I'll migrate to that one for my BH... Alternatively I could just buy another sheet of T05fx, but this is more fun... and educational."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,At least thats my excuse.I was lucky that my spare gfx card sold... so now I can blow that (spare) cash on the rubbers  Like a boss Equipment Junkie
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Looking forward for the review apophis!
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It's a long time now,""apophis"", since this post, so hopefully you're ready to let us know your opinion of the differences between bluefire m1 and rasant ."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"i'm realy interested in a comparison between these 2 rubbers,are there real differences here,more than just the color of the sponges?"
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"it would be much appreciated if anyone with experience with these two rubbers would share his views with us,thank you!"
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I did get a hit with the Rasant the other month and it felt good, I didn't get the Blue fire as when I ordered them the rubbers where lost in post so when I got my money back from the seller I got a fully bty set up as in my sig I got a sheet as a tester from someone else at the club as they didnt like it.The Rasant I used was pretty fast, at least 2.1m sponge when I measured it with the ruler."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It felt springy and was more difficult to play on the short game then T64, as the ball seemed to ping off the rubber quicker, I dont know if its the tension effect on the topsheet or something different."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"When you can engage the sponge by hitting harder strokes it felt similar to T64, fast, spinny..."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Though I still found the T64 easier on the short game.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Again both are fast rubbers so I'm unsure what the difference is with the Rasant to make it more difficult playing the same short strokes, the Rasant does feel faster on the TB-ALC."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Serving I found did not have too much of a difference, maybe a little less spin, but not really much to make a huge difference."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Playing back from the table the two rubbers feel much the same on the strokes, with the Rasant seeming to have a flatter trajectory of the bat and a little less topspin on the ball.It really depends of your game, I think that if people are topspinning the ball heavily, the better rubbers would be the T05 or T64 compared to the Rasant."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,The Rasant is feels more suited for a counter hitting and flat driving/hitting sort of game to me.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It may suit some punch backhand players as well where the speed is likely going to be more of an advantage, or maybe even suit some backhands of players."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Over all I found the Rasant a little less forgiving on stroke play, but I think with more time to adjust and get used to the rubber it would be a fine rubber in its own right."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"thank you ""apophis"".if you'll ever happen to have a hit with Donic bluefire m1 as well, it 'll be interesting to read your comparison with rasant.can anybody else contribute his knowladge about this Rasant vs bluefire m1 issue?"
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I play against Rasant pretty much every time I play so I'm getting quite used to what it can and can't do.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It's very good at lifting heavy backspin and doing it easily, it suits guys that can use the extreme bounce of the rubber to make heavy spin with that bounce, not to go forward, but to make spin with the bounce in diagonals out of the sponge."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Guys that don't hit the ball at 50,000 miles per hour or depend on the blade for spin but rather work with the sponge to get spin."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Good level players that don't hit hard, who can control it, that's who it works well for.I still like the feel of Rasant more than T05, T05 always feels somehow ""mushy"" to me."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Then again I can't really control either  unless I use them on the forehand and I'm not going to do that.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,bump.nobody else?
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I have used BF M2 for a week or so after several years of T05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,(I bought this in a shop in Cologne Germany that is owned by Jorg Rosskopf's brother!)
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Mine is red, max thickness on forehand."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"The bottom line is that M2 is the first "" T05 alternative"" I have tried that is acceptable, this after 4+ years with T05 and after spending way too much money on alternatives that I ripped off my blade in disgust, sometimes after just five minutes of play (see below)."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,M2 doesn't feel exactly like T05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It is a touch slower, and the ball feels different."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Not worse, just different."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It is an excellent feel, though."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Some people have described it as more ""liquid"" and that is about right, as if the top sheet is more pliant."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"The thing is, if you are used to T05, you can play exactly the same way, and play just as well without having to make many adjustments at all."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"You can get the same high arc spins, you can use pretty much the same racket angles."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I have not found that to be the case with any of the ""alternatives"" that have been touted over the last several years."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"If I had to cite differences, I would be that M2 does not feel quite as nice as T05 on blocks (although I certainly made the shot just as well), and it really shines on opening loops against underspin, or counterloops."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It could be that M1 would be better in that regard, I haven't tried it yet.It has a very strong smell -- exactly the same smell as the Dandoy Bio Boost and the Tibhar booster -- and there is no doubt that it comes heavily factory-tuned."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Some people have said that they actually like it better after some of that tuning wears off.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I will report later how that goes.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"But if performance declines, well I will know how to bring it back.Rasant is not one of the alternatives I've tried, so I can't compare."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"But I have tried Hexer, Rhyzm, Vega, Baracuda, Acuda S1, Genius, Adidas P7, and a bunch of others that I can't remember just now, along with a bunch of tensors from the days before I used Tenergy."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,(Back in the day I used Bryce very heavily speed glued).
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Among the non-tensors, Calibra LT was not a terrible rubber, but too fast for my liking."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Some of the Boost series felt ok, but I didn't feel like my shots had much penetration."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,None of these rubbers could really be described as a Tenergy alternative for people who really like Tenergy.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Thank you for the write up Baal.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"Looking forward to your reviews of M1, M3 and Rasant."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I dont like Ten05 fx, too soft, too slow.Just take a hard, max Ten05, or Raza or HexerHD are also good"
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,M2 is good.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,But I am back with T05.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,In the end I still like it better.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,If money was tighter I would stick with the M2.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,I am guessing that I would prefer M1 but haven't tried it yet and don't have plans anytime soon.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I've tried the M1 for 5 minutes and didn't like it  that was because I didn't like the blade / rubber combo, but my team mate & coach & one of the best players in the country decided to stick with it."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"He played it on BH mostly, but in general he alternated between BH and FH in training."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"It was really hard for me to play against M1, balls seemed really fast and with good spin."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"In general he liked the rubber, but.. First bubbles showed after 2.5 weeks of playing (~45 hours).I'm wondering how my M3 will be doing (ordered, still waiting for the rubber)."
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,Tried M3 my self.
80,5f6c2cdc7da9e46ccbe155ce,Comparing Tenergy 05/64 vs Rasant vs Bluefire M1/M2/M3,"I will not double post, so you will have to read my thoughts on M3 in this thread: viewtopic.php?f=44&t=19868&p=232503#p232503"
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,If you have good bh technique - then both maxIf you are not so confident with you bh - 2.0 bh and max fhYou should consider bluefire M3.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,It's really good rubber.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Step up from Acuda S3(one and only disadvantage is heavier weight).
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"M3 vs S3 (M3 - much more spin, tad more speed and control= everything improved)"
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,So should I get the M3 for both sides or just forehand and S3 for backhand?
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,It depends on your preferences.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,If you have head-heavy blade then putting 2xM3 could be nightmare.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,If you got more balanced blade I would opt for 2x M3.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,To reduce weight you can go BH2.0 and FHMax.If you don't care about weight - M3 all the way.Anyway Acuda and Bluefire are really good rubbers so you can't go wrong with them !
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,It is difficult to give you advice as we don't know what sort of game you play.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,If you have a modern attacking style I would always go with MAX both sides.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"My blade is AVX Ma Wenge, its only 85g for a carbon layered blade."
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"Its pretty nice though, so I'm thinking about going with 2x M3 with max thickness on both sides."
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Thanks for the suggestions.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,I wouldn't go for an advanced recommendation if I'm not what I say about myself.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Obviously I'm a modern offensive player from close to middle from the table.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,I'm not quite sure what you mean.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,By 'what sort of game you play' I was referring to what style of player you are.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,ie Do you stay up close and block/flat hit?
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"Are you an all-round player who chops, hits and lob?"
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,etc There are many different styles you could be.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Given that you didn't stress what style you play how can it be 'obvious' that you are a modern attacking player?
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,The majority of the people on this forum are not modern attacking players.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"Sorry for the bad post, what I meant is my playing style is an offensive player that plays from close to middle ranges, I have a good topspin, loops and smashes in my forehand I don't usually chop but I know how to, I have a good blocking skill in my backhand and can perform well with lobs."
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"My playing style is similar to Zhang Jike, only that he is a pro and I'm not and he is my Idol because of his fast attacks and powerful topspin and loops and that's what I'm trying to do in a competition."
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"I've been playing for 3 years now, I usually play at our table tennis club near at our house."
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Then M3 Max on both sides : ) There is no doubt.
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,"Thanks for the suggestions, I read the review from haggisv's post about the Donic Bluefire Series it was mentioned that ""the Bluefire in combination with the Bloodwood 5 blade, after a few rallies you’ll immediately notice the high dynamic of this rubber sheet and the pleasant and unique feeling that it creates when hitting the ball."""
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Is the blade that good when paired with the Bluefire Series?
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,I'll be getting my new racket this week!
81,5f6c2cdd7da9e46ccbe155cf,Max or 2.0 thickness for the Acuda S3?,Yeah    for me!
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Isn't it generally accepted that black rubbers tend to be a hair tackier since they don't have the red color dye in them?For that reason I play black on my jpen.Seems like a lot of pros play black on their forehands also.Hope this helps you decide.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???, Thanks
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Black!
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I don't know if I've ever seen anyone use a Hurricane family rubber in red.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Tacky red rubbers just don't seem as tacky nor to hold their tackiness as well.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Ma Lin used red tg2 for years.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"I've used red h2 before, it's maybe slightly different to the black."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Red is perhaps slightly faster and harder.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Usually I use black on fh becsuse slow and soft is always better.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Most of the guys I know play with a black hurricane on their FH and a red tenergy on their BH.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Do you know a better inverted (I know Short pips are good) rubber for over the table and close the table play??
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,?I will use one of this blade:Donic Baum Sawtec OffDonic Person Dotec OffTibhar Power 40 Off (7 plies)TSP Balsa Glasfiber 4.5 Allor may be I sale one of them and buy other.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,On the BH I will use long pips OX...
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"DO you spin or hit the ball?If you're playing with OX LPs on the BH, than the blade choice will be more important for the LP than the inverted.I would not recommend the TSP for that style... it's too bouncy IMO.The others seem a little fast too... you much play quite agressively with the pimples?"
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"I would prefer the tsp for attacking at the table with h2, not sure about the ox pips and no I don't know of a better inverted rubber for a really close attack especially on a balsa blade."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"Trouble is, it goes from best to really bad once you move off the table."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I must keep pushing for my beloved Nittaku Hammond Pro Beta.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"It's medium-fast, medium sponge, medium-low throw, not bouncy, impervious to humidity, resistant to chipping around the edges, and great control for its speed."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,THe HPB seems to work on any blade I put it on.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I recently talked one my club's 2000-level players (1st division at our club) into using the HPB and he put it on both sides of a Xiom Zetro Quad OFF+ blade.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,He said it gave him better touch and his loops are killers.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,With T05 he was sending too many shots off the table and he was holding back.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,He doesn't have to hold back now and his power is effective again.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I practice block for him and with this new combo I find it really hard to block more than four in a row.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I love Nittaku because their products are of such high quality and the HPB rubbers only cost about US$40.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,It's a great rubber for any level.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I also think that way.Ma Lin's 3rd ball got more smash than spin.Probably that's why he is using a stiff blade too.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,Yesterday I was playing a match.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,I win one play and loose the other.
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"The one I win, I was playing with TSP Balsa fiberglas 4.5 all FH: Joola Explode Sensitive max red and BH: Giant Dragon Meteorite OX."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"The one I loose was with Donic Baum Sawtec Off and FH: Butterfly Spin Art max red, BH: TSP Curp P4 Ox."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"I will try to show the videos later....And yes, I love the way Ma lin plays.... ¿There is a player with the same way as Malin in FH and longs pips in BH??"
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,?Loosing:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GX7pnxsN4&feature=youtu.beWining:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El81DfmfpKI&feature=youtu.be
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"Here's a bit of history about red and black rubbers for all the younger members here...I was asked a couple of weeks ago by George Downing (current England Junior Number 2) why all of us older players use red on the forehand side and black on the backhand side, whereas all the younger players use red on the backhand and black on the forehand.I explained to him that it was because of what happened in 1986.When the two-colour rule came into force on 1 July 1986, the new black rubbers were much slower than the traditional red rubbers, so players put them on their backhand side.At that time, players predominately used forehand strokes and the backhand was mainly used only as a controlling stroke."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,"So it made sense to use the black rubber on the backhand.Of course, since then, the game has moved on and the backhand is used much more by the top players now, and the difference between red and black rubbers is no where near as much as in 1986.But if you're an older player, you tend to stick with what's familiar."
82,5f6c2ce07da9e46ccbe155d1,DHS Hurricane 2 Red or Black???,So most of us still use red on the forehand and black on the backhand.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,Good to see it's on the ITTF list.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"If someone used it in the Olympics, they must have been training with it for a while."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,I got my pawz on a free sheet of the very hard-sponged Tibhar Evolution MP-X a week or two back.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"Forutunately for me, I have been playing with the Uber-hard sponged Tibhar Aurus on FH for a year, so this hard sponged rubber is not much a change to operate for me."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,I slapped it on my TBS when I immediately went to Bucheon Ace TTC right after my Nexy HQ visit to give it a test.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,I played some matches with the club locals and a short summary would be that Evolution MP-X plays like a tenergized version of Aurus.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"There is a bit more pace, a bit more spin, and a little more feel."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"It plays a bit softer than Aurus, but i doubt the sponge is any softer."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,The rubber did everything Aurus does with more feel and speed/spin.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"Played pretty close to T64, even the sponge looked a lot like T64 sponge."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,my sheet was Red max sponge MP-X cut and water-glued to a different taller Nexy balde tested previously by nexy prez Moon for a session.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,I water-glued to the TBS and cut off the excess at the top.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"Noce looking rubber and HARD sponge, which I really like on FH wing."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,What is differnt on this rubber is the pimple geometry.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"if you look at it, the nipples are thinner and wider spaced in a different pattern as well."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"The result is more dwell and feel, plus that awesome sponge transmits the power and spin.I made a vid goofing of in a casual doubles match over there at Ace club in Bucheon."
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"Suprisingly, when I google Tibhar Evolution Rubber, I get my thread I made about it at MyTT as the first hit!"
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"I have never had anything I did make top hit for a google search, prolly never happen again.https://www.google.co.kr/search?num=50&hl=en&safe=off&site=&source=hp&q=tibhar+eveolution+rubber&oq=tibhar+eveolution+rubber&gs_l=hp.3...1645.6461.0.6765.24.23.0.1.1.0.233.2454.9j13j1.23.0...0.0...1c.1.O16YG1rjbqYHere is the doubles vid goofing off, which we lost at deuce."

83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,This vid is remarkable as my partner and BOTH opponents were using Long Pimples on BH.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,When is it you walk off the street into a TT club right into a pickup doubles match and everyone but yourself is using darksider equipment.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,Hehe.
83,5f6c2d0e7da9e46ccbe155e8,Tibhar Evolution Series FX-P / MX-P,"this vid doesn't show my FH with Evolution a lot as a lot of my attacking chances came to me on the BH wing, which I did OK to finish using $7 XP 2008 Super Power."

85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,to loop!!??
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,!
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less, I agree.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,The point of tensors is to mimic the high speed/spin of speedglued rubbers.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"If you want something tamer than that, save some $ and buy Sriver."
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,It'll last longer too...
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Some blockers like tensors too.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"This is a might be a bit of an overstatement but if you don't loop or loop often you are better off with a short pip, much more annoying to play against than inverted with that type of player when they have short pips."
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,I would recommend against 05fx.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,The throw is too high and its a looping rubber... difficult to chop.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Sriver is a good choice i would say.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,If you want more spin and catapult effect a thin 64fx would do too.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,And its decent for chopping.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,This is definitely an overstatement.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,If I read it correctly you are basically saying that every player who doesn't very often can better switch to pips?
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Table Tennis has many styles and looping is just one of them.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"Most styles can be executed perfectly with inverted!Many tensors come in 1.8, but like others said if you don't loop very often, classic rubbers like sriver, mark v or coppa might be a better choice."
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"Donic f2 was a standard for BH rubber in 1.8, back some years ago."
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,But as a Donic big slam user ( as well as F3) the tensor is like they said more used for spinning and adding speed to the rubber performance.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"You can chop with these rubbers from a distance, but up close or mid-distance takes alot of talent and is very hard to do."
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,If you like to chop from mid-distance A tensor can be ok to use.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Try big slam 1.8 or Vario big slam which is a little slower.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Are you fishing a return or trying to create more controllable backspin?.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Do you use Long pips for chopping?
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,and do you/can you learn to flip.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,I have one blade that I put globe 999 1.5 on and it chops very well on the FH side if needed.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"It is not my main blade as I just purchased a 90 gram FL Nittaku Monophonic that I will set up with Talon ox, (for chopping,attack) and big slam max for looping and attack."
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,If you plan to chop with your FH with inverted I would suggest something different.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,"If you plan to chop with your BH, use short pips, med pips or best of all long pips...IMHOPeace GIG"
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,I think what I am looking for is to get the most speed and spin from a controlled compact stroke as I can.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,I do some chopping but it is not my primary strategy.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,I play more of a controlled topspin and blocking style.
85,5f6c2d397da9e46ccbe155fb,Tensor with 1.8 mm sponge or less,Tenergy 64fx fits that exact description for me.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"This question interests me too, because my friend is making a decision between these two rubbers.I think that HD must be faster and spinier, but what I want to know most is: how much harder is HD?"
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Know nothing about Hexer but i have used Xiom Omega IV Asia and Pro, on the same tri-carbon blade."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Asia seems to have a noticeably softer sponge than Pro despite the claims to the contrary.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"This is confirmed by the differences in feel, sound, bounce, and dwell time, but i still can't decide which one i like better."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Neither is very spinny until you fully engage the sponge on loop drives.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"thank you big_lou for your respond!c'mon people, nobody else has some info about these rubbers to add?"
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,at least two of us are waiting for your inputs...!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I've only tried the Hexer HD so I cannot compare.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The Hexer HD topsheet feels hard but thin, and it feels like you can't really get the spin until you stretch that topsheet."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,With a softer topsheet (and I assume the XIOM ones are softer) you can get spin more easily but brushing more.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Speed wise I find the Hexer HD pretty quick...
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I would think either would be fast enough.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Hi our top player here uses hexer HD on his BH and OIV euro on FH, on a BBC 7-9-7 blade ( supplied by me ) and he tells me the OIV is faster spiner and less effected by incoming spin."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,He just made semi final of NZ second biggest tornament today.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,He is a big BH player and Andro hexer HD on his BH as it is fast enough with his uper power but the OIV euro to speed up his FH
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Am thinking to to put Omega 4 pro on my FH too.Nice to know tha is spiner and less effected by incoming spin.. .
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I need more informatiom about this rubber.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I heard good things abou Omega 4 pro.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,A lot of the top Victorian players are using Hexer HD.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I don't know of any that are using Omega 4..
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I have to talked to someone that uses Omega 4 in another state and he said it was a fairly good rubber.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Just going off the sheer numbers high rated players that say HD is the best rubber around I would go with that myself if I were using a tensor on the forehand.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"I do know the top sheet on HD is made from a different formula to the other tensors, you can see when it's cut that it's not the same"
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I think a lot has to do with the distributors in the respective states foam.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The Andro distributor is in VIC, and since they let many people try it and spread the word, a lot of people like it and change over to it."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The XIOM distributor is in NSW, and as such it's likely to be more popular there."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"I'm sure both are very good rubbers and suitable for the higher levels, but I don't think we can let the numbers decide which is the better rubber."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"the issue here is not which rubber is 'better',hexer hd or O4, but what are the differeces between HD and Xiom O4 pro & asia in terms of hardness, speed and spin."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,at least this was my intention while starting & defining this thread.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,so please let's try to stay on that course...thank you all for your replies!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,If you are still interested in the comparison Omega IV Pro is faster and spinnier than all Hexers.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,It is a touch too fast especially on a carbon blade and needs solid technique.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The throw while blocking is low which is great and it is relatively insensitive to incoming spin.You could think of it as a Hexer HD with a touch softer and grippier topsheet, a softer sponge , more speed and spin.Like HD you really have to get some bat speed going and engage the sponge is you want that crazy spin.I use OIV Pro on my BH in max thickness."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,thank you ashish!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"i was thinking of replacing hexer hd on my forehand with xiom o4 pro or asia,but as i'm very pleased with hd and i could'nt get any convincing info about omega4 being more suitable for me i decided and ordered a new sheet of hd 2 days ago... but i could not resist trying the new bluefire m1 on my backhand,so along with the new hd i ordered the bluefire as well, to replace my regular hexer although it works for me and i'm quite used to it and like it."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"but, you know,the ej bug..."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I'm currently using Omega IV Pro on my FH.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,It's decent rubber but the sponge is a bit hard for my tastes and so I will soon be switching to Omega IV Europe.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I have had a few brief hits with Hexer HD and found it fast enough but lacking in spin when looping.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Another player at our club (very strong -US2450-2500ish) had a similar problem with it.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Do not use Omega Pro if you are playing with a hard-outers blade, it would be altogether too hard a combo."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"Xiom 4 Asia is a very good rubber, being using it for a long time now - in my opinion certainly better than Pro for my style and purposes.Cannot compare to Hexer HD but I am told that it is basically the same as Acuda S1 Turbo just under different brand."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Just posted a comparison for those two in another thread (exactly where they compare S1T and Hexer HD).
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I agree that Xiom Omega IV Asia is a very good rubber but if it's certainly better than the Omega IV Pro?
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I think that both are very similar but the Pro has a softer topsheet!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The top players that previously used the Pro, who tried my racket with the Asia switched to the Asia."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,But after a couple of months they switched back to Pro claiming that Asia was just too hard for their tastes.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,By mistake I got a sheet of Pro and I use it on my forehand and Asia on the backhand.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Both are excellent rubbers!
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Topsheet on Pro might be marginally softer but the sponge is even harder than on Asia whcih makes it really hard to do good attacking shots.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,In short game Pro might be better for flipping or non-flat game but that's not my bag (mostly not).
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,So for my style Asia is certainly preferable on both sides.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"But, hey, we all play differently."
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia, Well I'm a flat hitter aswell and I really can't feel much difference between the two rubbers.
86,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,The sponge of pro is definitely not harder than the asia( check the hardness ratings).

87,5f6c2d457da9e46ccbe15600,Anyone recognize this blade or rubber?,Looks like Grip S

87,5f6c2d457da9e46ccbe15600,Anyone recognize this blade or rubber?,?
87,5f6c2d457da9e46ccbe15600,Anyone recognize this blade or rubber?,For that blade you'd expect an ITTF approved rubber.
87,5f6c2d457da9e46ccbe15600,Anyone recognize this blade or rubber?,"Looks a bit like the Wilson Hammer label, but not a perfect match."
87,5f6c2d457da9e46ccbe15600,Anyone recognize this blade or rubber?,"Anyway, that's the closest match I can find from the ITTF LARC lookup, but for a few of the listed rubbers the label image is missing."

89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,Throw is medium.
89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,Speed is faster than Tenergy.

89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,"Yeah, Tenergy 64 is the way to go in this case."
89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,"It will feel around the same hardness, but should be quicker."

89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,Everyone I've spoken to have said that it is the next step on from 05 FX and actually suggested that the top sheet is softer than the regular Tenergy 05.
89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,Hopefully the 64 will give me a little bit more bite on my power loops but retain the slightly softer feel that I prefer.I'll report back after some practice
89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,I had a brief hit with the 64 at the weekend at a venue which is known for its slow conditions and it performed very well.
89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,I have a few more practice sessions this week where the conditions will be more normal (i.e.
89,5f6c2d7e7da9e46ccbe15617,Tenergy Questions - 05 / 64 / FX?,"faster ) Although it is quicker, the softer top sheet does seem to allow the ball to sink in and produce great spin."

90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I had looked at it, but the ratings say the Barracuda Big Slam is even faster than the Narucross GS Soft, so my guess is its also too fast."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I also looked at Desto F3 Big Slam, but its spin ratings are lower than the Vario and Barracuda versions."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Yesterday I played for a few hours with used sheets of the Yasaka Pryde 30 and the Donic Vario Big Slam on my Defence II blades, and I was able to play well with both."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I've been thinking it through, and the deep, long distance, forehand chop would be nice to have, but the critical chop for me is the one up near the table against serves, pushes, and first topspin attempts before the big attack starts."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I have to get those back low, spinny, and oddly placed so they are hard to attack, else I get looped or smashed at.I had a problem with the Vario (and the Pryde, too, I think, because the speeds were similar), though."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"My practice partner liked it, but maybe part of the reason why was because he was able to block back my drives and smashes with a high degree of consistency, and I had to smack the ball a bunch of times on each point, and eventually to an odd place on the table, to actually get the point."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,That assumes I didn't miss in the meantime.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,With the Narucross its very rare they get blocked back.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Although it would make practicing a lot more fun, it would cost me a lot of points, games and matches if my drives and smashes were easily returned."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Being a defender with a slow defensive blade is tough enough without the drives and smashes coming back, too.Therefore, I'm thinking of going with the Narucross GS Super Soft with the thinner sponge, and just try my best to learn to chop with it as best I can, and try to learn its limits, chopping wise, and learn to attack what can't easily be chopped."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"It means getting my reflexes to switch to attack more, which is a big change for me.PS: I noticed you have Tenergy 05 FX 1.7."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Do you chop with it?
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I haven't seen that for sale and I didn't have good luck trying to chop with the 1.9 or 2.1 versions.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I dunno I'd want to put another $80 into Butterfly rubber after already wasting over $200 trying them.

90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Have you played any Sriver FX G3 type rubbers?
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,If the Yanus is too slow the Tacky C you are considering is way too slow.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,It plays like a slightly spinnier version of Yanus with a dead sponge.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Ok, I guess I'm not surprised, there."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I will put the Yanus DF 2.0 back on and try it again, though, just to be sure."

90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I had trouble with it way back when I bought my Butterfly Secretin-K in 1975 and that was the first inverted rubber I put on it.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Mark V was the second, and I couldn't hit the table with it, either."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"It was quite an adjustment going from chopping with sandpaper to inverted rubber, LOL.FYI, what I did to ""test"" these different rubbers was to put each on my Butterfly Defence II blade, and hit vs my robot, all at one speed as fast as I could set it and still hit the table, direct it to my FH, and try chopping back 20 balls, and hitting back another 20."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The Yanus 2.0 was similar to the Vario Big Slam Max at chopping, but didn't seem to hit as fast when I was driving/smashing them back, if I recall correctly."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Of course that was a very seat of the pants subjective test in terms of speed, but the idea was that if it was too slow when I was smashing it, people would be able to return it more easily."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,The chop part of the test was whether I could chop it back low reliably.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"On both the chopping and hitting I noted whether I had problems hitting the table or not, and only the faster rubbers had trouble there when chopping, the Narucross doing the best of the faster bunch probably because I'm currently most used to it.I did go look at Butterfly's site and found a comparison chart, and it looks like to get loads of spin, if Tackfire C isn't fast enough, then SpinArt is the next faster of the soft ones before the Tenergy 05 FX."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I know someone that uses Spinart, but I don't see him often.http://www.butterflyonline.com/template ... ations.pdfPS: I tried them all again, and added Stiga Magna TC II, hitting about 80 balls for each."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The Yanus and Vario still seem slowest smashing, and wouldn't scare anyone, but were the best at chopping."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The Narucross GS Soft with 2.1 sponge was the fastest and highest percentage smashing it, followed by the 1.9 version and the sound and speed for them was frightening."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The chops weren't as short with them, though, but the percentage wasn't terrible, about 10% less than the Vario or Yanus."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The Pryde 30 was probably the closest thing to capable of doing both well, but excelling at neither."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I wouldn't categorize Spinart in the soft department.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Have you tried a few of the joola rubbers, like a tango type rubber?"
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"A good amount of them are fairly quick, usually pretty low throw so easier for chopping, not too reactive to incoming spin."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"with the tenergy 05fx pushing back a serve return the ball stays flat/low and very spinny,unusual for a high throw pronounced arc looping rubber and i have tried loads before i found this although some of this is probably down to my blade,i reckon the def2 would return the serve as well but in a 1.7 thickness probably won`t loop as well as the defplay due to it`s extra stiffness"
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I haven't ever tried or seen any Joola rubber that I know of.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,But one thing you helped with is I didn't know that a lower throw angle would help keep chops low.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,@Old-Man-Southpaw - I just like to ask as a sidenote about the Nittaku Narucross GS Soft 1.9 rubber.How does the GS Soft perform on serves and what thickness would be ideal for it since you have also tried to 2.1 mm version?I can talk about the Barracuda Big Slam for you since I have tried it.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I find it as a rubber that can drive, loop, smash, serve, push or chop well and it has good ball feel."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"If you plan to use it on your defensive blade, I'd suggest using the Max version."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"If you use the 2.0mm version, it will be good for close to the table play but for the mid-distance game , you will have to exert more effort."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,The GS soft does great on serves.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I like the 2.1 better.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I really don't notice any difference chopping, and at this point, I've come to the conclusion that I need the attack quickness and extra spin that the thicker sponge gives more than what improvement there was in chopping."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"With the chops, them being more natural to me, I find it easier to adjust what I'm doing, where with my attack I have a slow blade and little clue, and am acting mostly on animal instincts, so need any and every edge I can get."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I ordered the Narucross GS Super Soft in 2.1 tonight.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I'm hoping its a little slower and spinnier, with a bit more control, and if it is, I'll be happy as a clam."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I got the thicker sponge because on chopping with the 1.9 vs 2.1 of the soft version there didn't seem to be much difference.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I left the soft 2.1 on the blade after today's test and went and right out of the gate with only 15 min playing time, I beat two test subjects who will beat me anytime I'm not playing at my best."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"It wasn't pretty or perfect, but I did win.I know I'm pushing the limits asking this rubber to chop, and asking myself to attack, so I promised myself that I will use the robot to play 200 balls a day each against it chopping and hitting on FH and another 200 a day doing the same on the BH until I get to where all these shots work consistently and reliably."

90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,How often do you smash???
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I tend to find that just using an attack catches the opponent off guard and is good enough to win the point...
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I probably would go with the sheet you can control well and place well while being able to spin well on serves...
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Smashing may happen 1 to 2 points a game.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,If you are a classic chopper its better to outlast your opponent.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,If you are a.modern defense player your weapon will be a loop or loopdrive more often than a smash.That being said all the h3 neos hit verywell and chop and serve great.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,If you like tenors and soft then the narucross would be my vote...
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,When I was using to Defence II the JOOLA Express 2 worked very well.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Actually, I tried H2 and H3 on my FH last summer, and they worked as far as being able to smack the ball, but I had trouble returning serves with them because I'm not great at reading the spin on them."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,That's a lot of the reason the Palio and then Donic FH rubber worked so well for me.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The Nittaku rubber is only a little tacky, just enough that I can catch the ball to get lots of spin, but not so much as to cause big problems returning serves.In the 2 matches last night, the tougher opponent (1700's) kept me down to a total of about 1 or 2 smashes per game this time."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"He works very hard at keeping it away from my FH, but that means he has to deal with my chop and pips smash from the BH, and he still lost 3 or 4 points a game on not getting my serves back, and the few smashes I did get were 3rd balls."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I have what I'd call a ""low smash"" shot that I use where I move my body first, then my arm like a whip, that I use for any ball to my FH over about 8"" high, and it goes like a bullet with a big crack sound down into their BH."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I've only had it blocked back a few times.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I've only beaten the guy 3 times now in a year, and that was the second time I did it with the 2.1 Narucross GS Soft."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"My FH chops and pushes weren't as low and reliable as I want them to be, but he wasn't able to convert too many of those into points, and I came from behind to squeak by 3-2."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The second opponent beat me 3-1 when I played him 2 weeks ago using the 1.9 Narucross GS Soft, but this time with the 2.1 I was just creaming him for 3 or 4 points a game with the smashes and low smashes (many 3rd ball), as well as another 3 or 4 mostly on the spinny FH serves."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I won 3-0 two matches in a row that way, and the margins got larger as I got used to hitting with the 2.1."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Oddly, he did well hitting back the pips, so I mostly chopped with them, forcing him to loop or push."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Whether it is too late or not, Barracuda Bigslam is not that fast in my opinion - it does everything well and the spin is very high:  = awesome  = awesome  = win"
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,i find H3 or Tg3 very good for returning serves as sometimes they carry the spin back tot he other person and thus becomes quite unpredictable for the other person.. takes some practice to get used to that
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Give a try to Donic Quattro Formula (1,8mm or 2mm?)."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Awesome loops and blocks.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Excellent at chopping at any distance and pushing.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"No default rubber, soft (35°), powerfull, with good control, very grippy...Quattro Formula is just a little bit faster than Vario BS, but more controlable and better for chops and pushes since Qf has the perfect dose of tension."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"(Barracuda BS is overdosed for me).I read someone talking about Joola Tango, wich seems to be an excellent choice too."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I'm a bit surpised too by your feeling about Yanus DF.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I agree; it is not a slow rubber.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,If u have narucross and like it then use that.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,No need wasting money on something you may like but not sure unless it's a real cheap pip... And still not too sure on that.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Well, many people suggested thinner sponge would help the pushes and chops, so I changed the order before it shipped to get the Nittaku Narucross GS Super Soft 1.9 sponge instead of the 2.1."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Other rubber suggested that didn't get to the thread here were Sriver G3 FX 1.8 and Juic 999 Turbo 1.8.It will probably take me a few weeks to fully adapt.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Hopefully I'll get a bit more control on the chops and pushes, and a bit more spin on the serves without losing my attack ability...Thanks for all the responses."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Its been quite a while.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I was able to adapt to the Nittaku Narucross GS Supersoft 1.9, and I do quite well pushing, chopping and serving with it, and am even able to generate a weak loop attack, now with it."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"But when I play people that are a lot better than me (ie 1900 to 2000), it seems even if I hit every shot with everything I have (I guess these are smashes), I have real trouble hitting a ball by them, and find myself smashing 5 or 6 times in a row in a rally, alternating locations, and they still send everything back, until eventually I miss off the side or back, or throw it into the net."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Yes, I win some points with them, but so many come back that the match exhausts me, and I get demoralized losing the point after all that effort and so many of what I'd consider good shots, LOL."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,And its not like I can push and chop against these people.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"They eat those shots up, it seems, so I'm forced to attack instead.Against the 1600 and under crowd, the same rubber and tactics do fine, and rallies rarely need more than 3 or 4 good smashes to end the point.The funny/sad thing is that it reminds me a lot of me beating the 1200 level people 11-0 or 11-1."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Its that same differential in ability, it seems, between me and the 1900 or 2000 people."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"The 1200 player hits the ball as hard as they can, this way and that, and I return everything, till they miss, point after point, game after game, till they get real frustrated."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"But the shoe is on the other foot here, with ME getting the short end of the stick.So, what to do?"
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"the Soft version with 1.9 wasn't real good at smashing, either, as I recall, and when I play with the Soft version with 2.1, I can't push and chop as well, and THAT costs me LOTS of points when my pushes and chops don't land.Anyway, I'm going to try Donic Barracuda Big Slam 1.8 or 2.0."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Its supposed to have a 39 deg sponge, and supposed to make a nice crack sound, like the Soft Narucross, I hope."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Maybe one of those will be able to both hit and chop...
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I'm playing 7 days a week, probably 15 or 20 hrs, and much of that is practicing hitting and chopping."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Hopefully I can find a way to hit a lot harder, or switching gear again will get me there... Any thoughts or suggestions?"
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I wish I had the recent losses taped to analyze.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I think I was playing well, but just wasn't able to convert it to enough points or games."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Your blade and rubber is more than fast and powerful enough to hit past your 2000-level opponents.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Defence II is like a rocket to me...
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,If I attack with it I could hit past most 2300-level players with ease.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I think you should work on getting more solid contact with the ball to transfer power more efficiently.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Hit through the ball instead of spinning the ball even when you are loopdriving.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,The sensation in your hand should be the ball going back at your opponent at a much faster pace than simply looping.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Also, you should feel that your entire body weight is pushing the ball back at a rapid rate."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Many 1500-1700 level players I have coached are scared of this faster pace (in fact scared of losing ""control""), so they could never get a solid contact with the ball."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,Your current equipment is fine.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Please take some time and watch some world-class players (such as current world champion Zhang Jike or Wang Hao) on Youtube, and see how they smoothly transfer energy to the ball."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"roundrobin,Thanks, I had another friend say something similar, but without backing it up with examples I could look at."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,I'll hunt down some vids and try to watch them closely and see if I can find ways to improve how I'm hitting the ball.
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"Yes, I think you are probably right that I'm putting too much into spinning it, and that is detracting from the speed of the ball off the hit."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"I seem to play well against the lower lever players, lately, but am really just getting crushed by anyone above my level and doing poorly against the loopers, even at my level, again."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"All matches seem to be either 3-0 or 0-3 lately.Another practice partner suggested that I take my backup blade and put the faster attacking FH setup back on it, and use that blade when playing people that I need to be attacking more against."
90,5f6c2d9c7da9e46ccbe15625,Modern Defender Attack/Serve/Push/Chop/Drive/Smash rubber?,"That may be my fallback position if I keep losing too badly, too often."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I am looking forward to your review!I also wonder about harder sponge versions.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,As a defender those really soft sponge rubbers just are inadequate on my defensive blades when I am playing mid distance/off the table.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I'll bet the 36deg Venus II will still feel quite hard on a non-chinese scale.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I just noticed that the black rubber had a sticker on it with 2 different hardnesses listed.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I asked Galaxy about this, and they told me it indicated measurements from 2 different scales."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"ONe scale is that DHS uses, the other is a japanese scale.The ones I got are 36deg on the DHS scale, which they say translates to 44-46 on the Japanese scale."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I am not sure the difference in standards.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I just have tried 35 (not sure what scale-inspirit quattro) and found those rated 40 and up MUCH better for off the table play.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,i have used the original venus and it was pretty good.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"The Inspirit Quattro is probable not a good reference, as I know for a fact that some batches were marked with the wrong values."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Somehow some of the 35deg and 40deg batches were mixed up for some distributors, creating some chaos  Even the original Venus comes in several different hardnesses, so ti depends on which one you got."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I always like the 36deg version, which was the softest available."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,dawei is legendary for wrong hardness marking.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,they follow this manufacturing flowchart:1. make some iq rubbers2.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,hope they have some hardness3.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,get some orders4.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,check the hardness asked for in those orders5.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,stamp the rubbers in inventory with the hardness ordered6.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,dispatch7.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"hope they hardness matches, and pray they don't come back8."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"if they don't, give more discount to dealers9."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,go to step one...
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,ROFL!
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,That's very clever debraj!
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I'd have to agree that it does make you wonder sometimes though, for some manufacturers."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"So how hard is it, haggisv?Can you compare the hardness feel to any bty rubber?Thinking of getting one, I liked my old Venus..Thank you"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Probably around Sriver hardness, perhaps a little firmer."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II, Darn it... harder than older Venus..Thank u sir...
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"No, it should be the same as the old Venus"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Any oxidation issues with this rubber?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Don't know yet, but I never had any problems with the old Venus."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"i'm very curious about your review Haggisv,why does it take so long XD XD?"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,LOL!
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I'll be playing with it tomorrow, finally!"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I had a bi of a hit with the Venus II on a Tachi blade.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I really liked it.The sheet is quite tacky, it can pick up a ball for quite a while."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,It seems tackier than the original Venus.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,The topsheet feel quite soft and elastic too... not sure if the original was quite a soft as this.Is it tuned?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Yes there is a definitely tuning feel giving the rubber a good boost compared to the original Venus.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Just like with the former tensors, you need to hit harder to get the glue feel and to get the sound.I found it to be a VERY spinny rubber, both on serves & pushes, but also on loops."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I tend to put a fair bit of sidepsin on my loops, and they were definitely kicking moe compared to my 999 rubber.It didn't feel overly fast, but then again my blade is not that fast, but it feels faster than my regular JUIC 999."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Throw is fairly high, similar to my 999, which made it a real easy adjustment."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"It's easier to hit with than the 999 and feels less sensitive to spin, and of course it makes the cracking sound, although I would not call it loud.Just like with many tensors, I reckon it would work well with a composite blade, which it will feel crisper and sound louder, if this is important to you.Overall I'm quite impressed and will continue playing with it against a few more people, and can see how consistant it is over time."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Here are some pictures:
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Thank you for the review!
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,HaggisV.Will the tuned effect wear off?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,It is enhanced more so than other chinese rubbers so i guess it would last much longer.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I don't know yet.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"The Hurricane Neo don't seem to wear off much, so I'd hope most use the same technology and would be similar."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Sounds promising so far.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Wondering whether it loses its tack like the previous Venus did after the 1st session?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I had no trouble getting the protection sheet to stick after the first session of a couple of hours.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I like the rubbers best when they are just mildly tacky, as the ones the stay really tacky just don't seem to loop that well."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,how do you compare this rubber with apollo?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,is it the same level of tackiness?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,I have no tried the Apollo yet.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I was keen to try the Venus II first, since I had not heard from anyone that had tried it."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I'm curious why the apollo is more expensive, as I expect the technology to be the same.I believe the original Venus was more expensive than most of the other Galaxy rubbers, since it uses a Japanese made sponge, not Chinese made like most of the others."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,What claims do Galaxy make about Venus II in comparison to Venus I?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Faster?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Spinnier?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,More Durable?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,(yeah right!)
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Tackier?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"All they told me is that it's the latest tuned version, and they say it's 'better' than Apollo."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I don't place much confidence in this, since 'better' is highly subjective and depends on what you want out of the rubber."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,It also doe snot explain why Apollo is more expensive...
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Hi HaggisvWas the Venus in red or black, and have you tried red dimond that I could get any sort of comparison too."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Mine was black.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Sorry I still have not tried those LKT rubbers, so I can't compare."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"So has this become your FH rubber now Haggisv, given you said it had some advantage over Juic 999 or is the jury still out?"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Since my seasons has finished, I won't have a forehand rubber till next season."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"it's still on my main bat though, so it's a good sign"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"I actually like this rubber.Humongous surprise!I was well prepared to hate it after the original venus.It hits, blocks, counterloops, loops, pushes and serves well."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Mediumish on everything.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Decent speed.I have not, however, found any real characteristic that would make it memorable - you know, H2: low throw, H3: spin/speed, T05: high throw/spin, unglued bryce: never lose, etc."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Venus2 is now in special in the shop, if anyone's interested  , Im gonna try one in 2mm"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,How is the Speed of Venus 2 compared to outlaw?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Does it play more like an euro/jap rubber or a classic chinese rubber?Would this be a good rubber for close to table hitting and blocking?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,slower I reckon
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,since you say that it's so versatile can you compare it with sriver?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,Anything on weight?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Is it possible to play Venus II FT in max on both wings for a ""not-so-muscled-person""?"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Hello TT Junkies,I'm still playing with my Juic 999 CHN which is very in good condition despite some white stains.I've also tryed the Xu Shaofa 999 LSZ but the tuning wasn't last very long.I've never played with the original Venus topsheet cause I red it was REALLY heavy.As Haggisv said before my Juic isn""t very powerful especially when you get off the table.So I can consider the Venus II as good new rubber... but I have few question : Is it a low throw rubber ?Is it softer in term of feeling compare with Xu Shaofa 999 ?"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,(cause I read 44-46° on DHS scale !
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,)Weight ?
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"As I don't want to get something to close with chinese rubbers standards (hard feeling, ...) I wish this rubber should be dynamic...finally I looking for China Sticky Tensor I guess."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"If someone may suggest a 999 like version with an oomph effect ... that's would be perfect.If Venus II doesn""t do the trick Palio Tensor Macro Era will ?Thanks for your answers and experience sharing."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"How does this rubber compare to Palio Thors in all aspects (spin, speed, block etc)?Thank you."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,The Palio Thor is a very great rubber but I'm very keen with the 999 series feeling.
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,(currently the 999 Blue Lucifer)I'll probably try the Venus II.Brahms
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Could someone please compare Venus 2 with other rubbers, like NEO H3, Xiom Vega Pro, Donic Acuda S1/S2, Galaxy Apollo1, Galaxy Apollo2, Galaxy Mars 2, tensors, Tenergy 05 ?"
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Especially in speed, throw, and hardness."
91,5f6c2e587da9e46ccbe1563b,Galaxy / Yin-He Venus II,"Seguso, I am following your question hoping a member with experience would pitch in."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Nille, give Rasant a go."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I don't think you will regret it!
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,What is it like compared to roxon 450?
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Is rasant/ calubra a lot faster than roxon 450?Also i'm quite pleased with the amount of spin I can create with roxon?
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Especially on the serves.Has to do with how soft the rubber is, hasn't it?Does anybody know how the other rubbers compare with roxon in those respects?Nille"
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Calibra is very quick but lacking in the spin department.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Roxon is a good rubber and you appear to be very happy with it - why change?
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,If it ain't broke...
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,You have got a good point.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The only thing I am not quite happy about with roxon is that I feel that it's a bit bouncy in the short game.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Maybe that is the case with most tensors?Also rubbers hopefully develop and maybe rasant is better than roxon?I've tried hexer to see if it was less bouncy in the short game.It was, but I found it too slow."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I have used Roxon before and didn't find it especially bouncy.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Maybe it is just a touch issue with you and you have to practice more short-pushing etc and gain some more experience (??).
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I think Calibra and Rasant would be bouncier than Roxon in the short game department.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I don't think Rasant is necessarily better than Roxon - it's just different.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,If you are still at a stage where rubber affects your short-game then I would just stick with Roxon.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I have played table tennis for many years, so I am not a beginner who needs to practice pushes in particular."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Tensors are generally bouncier than older rubbet types.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,No problem - it's tricky talking about rubber sometimes when you don't know where the other person is at (hence my use of question marks).
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,You are correct that tensors are generally bouncier than the old staples but I think it is just something you learn to adjust to after a short while.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,From memory Roxon is somewhere in between Mark V and Rasant/T05.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It's a good do-anything rubber.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,T05/Rasant are better suited if you are an advanced looper/counter-looper.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,This is IMO of course.Edit - Whilst it id not identical with Rasant/T05 I would throw Calibra into the same advanced looping category.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Sorry, was away for a day and couldn't answer."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,My way of describing Rasant would be a similar speed to Roxon 450 with greater spin and better control.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I played with R450 for about 2 years, then went to Hexer Plus basically."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"H+ was an ounce slower than R450 with less ""bounce"" so its control was better, and similar spin."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Rasant has re-instated the speed of my FH back to R450, still with less ""bounce"" but with greater spin capabilities."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I think its awesome, and in keeping with an ""Andro"" feel."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I would totally agree (re Calibra).
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Never played with it, but someone I played last week used it on their FH and the speed of their loops compared to what they previously used (don't recall what that was) was highly pronounced."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"The way you describe it, it sounds as if it's just what i' m looking for then.Better spin, better control, but as fast as 450.My spinny serves are an essential part of my game, and if I can generate more spin, it sounds like a very good alternative."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I tried pryde some time ago, but found it very hard to generate spin on the serves."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"But it is a lot harder isn't it?With roxon 450 i've had max on fh and one step slower on bh, so that would probably be a good idea on rasant as well?"
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It would IMO.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"A word of advice though, I'd change one rubber at a time."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Rasant is harder to get the spin out of from soft contact.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"It took me a little while to adjust and get as much spin on serves, but I feel I have after a few rounds with it."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Thats coming from Hexer+ though.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"If I came straight from the bouncier R450, it might not be as hard to adjust."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Still, I would expect an adjustment period of some degree."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,So it is a bit harder than roxon 450 then?
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Probably is, I couldn't say for sure, simply because I wouldn't think there'd be 5 degrees in it...which means I'd need a gauge to tell properly."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Thanks for your help.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I think I""ll buy rasant, unless somebody has something very favourable to say about calibra."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I know there is a lot of good to be said about Calibra, but I can only say from an opponents point of view."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,That's one step removed from being able to say anything directly about it really.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Kinda like ""hearsay"""
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I finally decided on calibra sound and played with it for the first time yesterday.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Wow, it fler Greta.Roughly the same speed as roxon 450, but control was a lot better."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Spin does not leave much to be desired either.I have always liked roxon 450, but also felt that I lost some unneccesary balls when chopping.Nille"
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Good to hear you found that you liked it Nille.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I'd love to see you find some Rasant to use now to compare it.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Yes, I'd really like to compare the two."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I have used Calibra Sound and really liked it for counter-looping and looping block.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,When you first use it it has a great glue effect on those shots.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,I seem to recall that this effect eventually waned but I'm not sure at what stage.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The main problem I had with Calibra Sound was the relative lack of spin.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,It's more difficult to get heavy topspin and as a result one gets less dip and the plane of the loop is flatter.I have played with Rasant for 10 minutes or so.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,IMO it is a different type of rubber than Calibra Sound.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,The sponge is harder (not super hard but harder than Calibra Sound) and I think (I'm not 100% sure) the top sheet is thicker.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Rasant has better spin than Calibra Sound.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"I hope the glue effect Will last for quite some time, sinceStiga's rubbers are usually good quality.My impression-i've only played with it once- is that I was able to generate a lot of spin on loops close to the table as well as on loops further away."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"Above all, the control was impressive although it is a fast rubber."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Our experiences differ but the main thing is that you are happy with it.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,Yes the Calibra sound has quite a lot softer sponge.
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"The glue effect is very high, I think mainly because with soft sponges the glue tends to feel much stronger."
92,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,"My practice partner use the Calibra sound... he can get very high spin but only at medium pace.. since he tend to either play medium pace loops and smashes when he wants to put it away, it works very well for him."

93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,!
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,IMO - In terms of control I think the blade has a far greater say in matters than the rubber does.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,If you have a fast rubber on a sensible blade you shouldn't have any control issues.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,"Hmmm, so maybe my answer is an all+ blade with a fast rubber?"
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Is the control comparable to using an off blade with a slower rubber?
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,I personally like fast rubbers with a slower blade.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Which blade/rubber combo's do you like or use?
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,"In China, I was using some very fast, Donic carbon blades."
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,I was getting coaching from provincial level players and playing 2 to 8 hours a day.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,I could control it playing so much and getting coaching several times a week.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,"Now, I have backed off to ALL+ or OFF- blades."
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Genius was my fav rubber untill they raised the price.

93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Any of the fast euro rubbers are good on the forhand.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Venus is another VERY good backhand rubber.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,"When playing Seemiller grip, I use a faster blade, and fast rubber."
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,"With Seemiller grip, I am chocked up on the bat so it helps with control."
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,"At Division 2 in Vic I'm still barely able to control any tensor on a ALL+ blade and I really should be using a slower blade than that, the further I go the more I see that I'm not skilled enough to be using a blade that fast."
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,I imagine anyone at an average to high intermediate level would play better with an allround blade than anything faster.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Having a high control blade is the most important thing you can do imho.
93,5f6c2e777da9e46ccbe15649,Most controllable/fast rubber?,Just have a hit with carbonman and it'll make you think you should be playing with a slice of fresh bread to get enough control to stop him punishing you

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,The only cons I can think of is that It does not look durable.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,The sponge is very soft and care must be taken in cutting and sticking it to the blade.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,I don't know how long it will last but I am enjoying it while its stuck to my alternate bat.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,I am thinking of using it as my primary weapon on my FH.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,It is really cool for my BH with my spinny loop spin kills against underspin streaking like hell.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,The only reason I don't use it on BH because of my Mark V which suit my BH better.

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,I have just a couple of recommendations for you.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,"Firstly you need to get out of the bad habit of chopping like you are using long pips, I can't stress enough how much you need to learn a good topspin backhand stroke."
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,"Just concentrate on getting that up to the same level as your forehand before you worry about anything else, you could also do with a slower blade."
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,"The Rakza soft seems to be working well, I can hear it click so it's in about the right range of softness for the power you are making right now."
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,Spend your rubber money on a good blade and then practice your backhand
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,"Palio Thor's is my rubber of choice, my forehand is more powerful than ever with it, and it's given my serves a huge boost too."

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,so which of my current prospects has the longest tack/spin retention?

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,A fantastic rubber for the price.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,Certainly good enough to get you up to 2000 rating
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,just narrowed my picks down to 2:Blue Whale II red sponge medium tuned/untunedPlaio Thor's comments?

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,I think developing a loop with a full swing is important so maybe untuned.

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,the slower the blade the more punishment you can unleash with the hurricane rubbers.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,if spin is what you want: Giant Dragon Topenergy soft  Has more spin than Thor's IMO.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,Agreed.

94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,Especially because you are still developing this one is good.
94,5f6c2e7c7da9e46ccbe1564a,best chinese rubbers w/out glue?,It makes you swing hard for hard shots and soft for slow shots.

95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,my oppinion : TG3 Blue Sponge softest of all the hurricanes and skylines.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,i think... not as heavy either.. i think..but what i found was that a tg3 commercial ( which is much harder than tg3 bs) is easier to play close to the table with when driving looping and killing those shots that bounce short near the net.but this was on a different blade as well( tg3 commercial + PG2 blade)..but i think the hiniki blade should be ok since it suited Huricane 3 neo provincial quite wellBut since i dont know what omega rubbers play like i cant suggest a rubber thats similar to them..general consensus is that you want a slower rubber.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,not spingy( which i think the omega are.

95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,something like the above and maybe 729-5. great controll.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,Nittaku Hammond Pro Beta is excellent for close-to-the-table counter-hitting and driving.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,You can hit right through spin with no problem.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,It's seems somewhat low throw (for me) which helps keep the ball on the table when playing in close.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,With a faster blade it even works well if you get driven back from the table.
95,5f6c2eb97da9e46ccbe15665,Best rubber for close to table looping / driving,This is becoming a very popular rubber at our club.

96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,"I tend to think a lot comes down to style and ability within that style though as to which rubber you choose, as well as preference of course."
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,A thinner fast rubber usually suits someone who hits through the ball more.
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,A slower thicker rubber for someone who wants to brush loop in a controlled way.

96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,hmm.
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,That depends on the feel...
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,I prefer thicker slower rubber..
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,I've got a weak backhand and hit a lot of reaction blocks close to the table so a speedy backhand rubber helps me a lot.
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,I also don't mind a bit of chopping and some more control so thin and fast is good for me  Maxed up sponge and a slow one at that on the forehand of course
96,5f6c2ec17da9e46ccbe1566a,Thin fast rubber or thicker slower rubber,"I agree with foam, when given the option of having BOTH (fast and thin AND allround and thick) I think that fast and thin on the BH and the allround on the FH would often work well.So to answer haggisv's question, the thick allround rubber would have more ball-sink into the rubber and therefore would usually give more spin on loops and serves."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,I'd also be interested in hearing about this comparison between Tackiness C and TIbhar Super Defense 40.
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"I use TIbhar Super Defense 40 Soft on a Xiom Aigis blade, and have wondered how the spin on the Tibhar rubber compares to that from Tackiness C. From various ratings, such as from Paddle Palace and others, it does seem as that the spin rating for TIbhar Super Defense 40 is markedly greater than that for Tackiness C. However, from this forum, and others, I get the impression that most people are very pleased with the amount of spin with Tackiness C."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"it`s been a while but:heavier backspin with tackiness c ball lands shorter on table with tackiness c loop is better/lower with super def 40 more spin on serve with tackiness c more control with tackiness c  the surface is grippy for super def,mild tack for tackiness c the catapult is higher for super def.....both rubbers were tested on def alpha and donic defplay,i prefered them on the donic although the most underspin was tackiness c 1.1 on def alpha,if the ball went long there was enough underspin to bring it back under the table almost to me(non grippy floor)"
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"Sorry, but I think that tackiness C is total crap now (compared to lets say 7 years ago)."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"Spin amounts is way lower, less tack/grip, just feels dead.."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,I would not recommend it to anyone anymore.
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,Thanks so much for all of your comments.One point that has confused me about Tackiness C is that 5-10 years ago there were a number of women pros that used this rubber.
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"There were also some men and women pros that used Tackifire Drive, e.g., Joo Se-Hyuk, Kim Kyung-Ah."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"However, as far as I am aware, none of the present-day professional defenders use these rubbers."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"Instead, they mostly seem to use tenergy."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"I recently resumed playing table tennis after being away from the sport for 25years, so I don't know what happened?"
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"As indicated by justas, has the quality of the rubber improved so much recently?"
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"Or, is it related to the speed glue ban and the subsequent requirement of water-based glues?"
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"(As I understand, rubbers are much slower nowadays because of the use of water-based glues."
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"Perhaps, this is why Tackiness C, which is already slow, is no longer sold in 1.1 and 1.3 mm here in the US.)"
97,5f6c2ecb7da9e46ccbe15671,Bty Tackiness C or Tibhar Super Def 40,"On the other perhaps my question about the pros is some sense not relevant for most defenders, if there are some defenders nowadays with ratings in the USATT 2300-2600 range that do use Tackiness C. It would be helpful for me to learn more about Tackiness C, as I am struggling to find a rubber for my forehand that I am happy with."
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?",One of my teammates has Stiga Chop & Drive.
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?",I'm not sure what thickness  I had a hit with it once because it was always my dream to have this rubber.
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?","It is a fairly slow rubber (as probably expected) but it can really hit through with a good, fast arm behind it."
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?",The soft sponge will of course mean that it is not the best for flat hitting.
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?","However, I found that I could really impart slow, heavy topspin with it."
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?",The GD submarine rubber at a guess will have fractionally more spin as I assume it will be more tacky.
98,5f6c2edc7da9e46ccbe1567b,"Which is slower, Stiga Chop & Drive or GD Submarine?","I don't think that there is much difference between the two so at an educated guess, I would say that the Giant Dragon Submarine is only just slower - though please do not rely entirely on my opinion as it may well be wrong"
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"Sriver FX Max for the backhand is used by many provincial players, (me too) on an OFF blade."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Pretty fast.Mark 5 Max on the forhand would be good.Maybe change the blade?
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"The Plasma, Roxon (430) or Hexer would work fine, and easy to hit with, but you'd probably need a thinner sponge than 2.0mm or he'll probably struggle with the control."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,With lower level push games tensors tend not to work so well as there is less touch than the classic style rubbers.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,I'd agree with Hookshot and go for a harder faster blade and the Sriver and Mark V. If Sriver isn't available then either go 2 Mark V's (a GPS or AD would be good) or perhaps use an Almana or Magna on one side.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"Servio, remember that whatever you get him, his equipment will be much different."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"If he is OK with that, then there are MANY suggestions."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,hard and fast rubbers... Tibhar Aurus at around $40 USD or so is the deal.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"calibra LT plus doesn't get much harder and LT is also pretty hard.BH rubber, try out cheap priced Dawei XP 2008 Super Power."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"It is an excellent OFF control rubber in the mold of Sriver, but way less expensive."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,2008 works good on just about any blade and costs well under $10 USD a sheet.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"As for hte blade, get him a blade with similar properties."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Calibra likes stiff blades better.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"Aurus will work with anything out there, as will xp 2008.if your father can glue and cut the rubbers himself, or get someone to do it for him there, great, keeping the same blade is cool.Tibhar Aurus is very inexpensive for such a high performing rubber."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"It doesnt get much cheaper than XP 2008, well under $10 a sheet anywhere.I get sponsored with Aurus and Calibra and really like them."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"I can buy them with a good discount here, so my cost is just under $40 a sheet for Aurus."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,I still have a lot of XP 2008 i buy them by the truckload to fix up rec center bats.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Thanks for the replies so far.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"Made me cross out the tensors completely, as the minimum thickness available really is 2.0  .The Dawei rubber for the BH seems an interesting suggestion."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Any thoughts on durability here?
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"(They do have the normal version here, not the XP).Apart from that tempted to get either:BH: Mark V 2.0, FH: Mark V maxBH: Mark V 2.0, FH: Magna 2.0And I'll make my dad try out some other blades I still have around when I get back to the Netherlands, but for now he simply wants to keep the blade as he likes the ''feel'' of it."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"While the Dawei rubber is heaps cheaper and good when new, it doesn't have near the lifespan of a Mark V. So if you go that way, expect to be needing a change again sooner than later."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,I had a mate who had it on a bat and played very moderately - once a week for 2 x 14 week seasons across a year with not much else in between.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"After a year they were not very grippy at all, and I gave him a new bat of mine (can't recall the setup - globe999 maybe) that left it for dead at that point."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Dawei XP 2008 Super Power lasts as much as most rubbers.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,I have used it on BH wing for over 2 years on my main bat and on a number of other bats.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,It will last 4-6 months of playing daily for 3-4 hours.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"As with any rubber, it can slowly oxidize on surface."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Cleaning with some lemon juice/olive oli restores ANY topsheet to near original state.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,You wont need the olive oil until 3 month mark and then maybe once a month.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"As a contrast, many modern rubber do not last me near as long."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,tenergy is a very average rubber after a month or two.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,Most other rubbers do not last more than 2 months on my FH playing every day.
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"I am a very FH happy kinda playing dude, but still, XP 2008 would outlast over half the stuff I use on FH.Now 999, that is one bullt-proof topsheet."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,"You clean that sucker with lemon juice/olive oil every now and then and it can last one long time, like over a year of daily play."
99,5f6c2f037da9e46ccbe1568e,Dad wants something harder/faster,You will destroy your sponge beofre you destroy the topsheet.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"M2 is only tacky for few weeks then it will become very grippy, like a very spinny euro rubber.H3 has thicker and harder topsheet and will stay tacky throughout it's life."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"mercury II (37°) is a bit springy, higher and slower than H3 but equal (almost) on spin, but it does bottom out in a harder stroke."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"sponge is really fragile, better not reglue."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,i recommend using on a hard/carbon blade.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,topsheet in h3 is a lot harder and therefore less forgiving (if you don't brush thinly enough or with enough decision you will miss).also the sponge in h3 is harder.mercury 2 37 RED is much harder than 37 BLACK and less brittle.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"black will bubble after 3 days, red never does.speedwise, mercury2 37 red is faster than NEO H3 on stiff blades, slower on flexible blades."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"in general, DHS rubbers are very slow on stiff blades, I am not sure why."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,maybe out of the packet.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,but once worn in they are quite fast on stiff blades like clipper
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"I've used a couple 37 blacks, no durability issues for me."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,Maybe you got a bad batch or something?
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"DHS rubbers on stiff blades are very difficult to use, the dwell time is too small, so you tend to brush more than usual to control it resulting in the slower apparent speed."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,That's my hypothesis anyway!
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"The Mercury II is definitely bouncier, and when new it's tackier too."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"However, both rubbers lose their tack pretty quickly, the H3Neo loses it in a week and the Mercury II in about 2 months."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"Doesn't really matter though as long as you use adhesive rubber covers as they'll restore the tack.The bottom line is that the H3Neo plays like a traditional Chinese rubber, while the Mercury II plays like an Eurojap rubber with a lot of tack."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"In other words, other than the tackiness, and I suppose a similar throw, the two really have nothing in common.Note that I've used 3 sheets of retail H3Neo, 1 commercial(ttnpp) at roughly 41 degrees, 1 provincial 40 degrees(ttnpp), 1 provincial 39 degrees(prott.cc), all black at 2.15mm."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"The 40 degree one and the commercial one played almost exactly alike, other than of course one being a bit softer."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,This is despite the commercial one measuring at 51 grams while the 40 degree provincial one was only 43 grams.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"The 39 degree one, however, was a completely different animal."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"First, it came out of the package with a TREMENDOUS reverse dome."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"The rubber would literally roll up on itself, with ends overlapping, while the other two would lie almost flat."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"It was a real pain in the neck to glue and especially reglue, BTW."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"Its weight was in between, at about 48 grams."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"Perhaps due to the reverse dome and the softer sponge, it feels to have much better dwell and spin than the other two, while being a bit slower."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"The differences are pretty noticeable, which is a bit surprising since the difference between the other two were barely detectable."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"The moral of the story I suppose is that different batches of H3Neo could play differently, even between provincial versions!"
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,H3 neo looses tack in a week.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,i think you are talking about initial Super tack there after which it goes to normal... also regular breathe and wipe brigns back that lost tack due to dust and other paticles
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"I did mention that it goes away in about a week, it's in the first paragraph."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"However, using adhesive rubber covers restores the tack."
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,I only clean my rubbers with water and cloth.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,"They are totally different rubbers, Mercury II plays very similar to an ESN tensor except is has less spin potential, most players can't make the potential of the ESN rubbers anyway so that's ok.H3 only has half that bounce and plays almost like a old time traditional Chinese tacky"
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,H3 NEO is an excellent backhand on a BTY Arlyte/Carbon blade like TBS.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,Can be used for FH in summer emergency as well.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,H3 NEO is not very tacky and that is OK by me.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,I prefer soft rubbers on my BH.
100,5f6c2f447da9e46ccbe156b8,h3 neo or mercury II forehand rubber?,I use Palio Hidden dragon on yinhe U4 and genius sound on stiga kevtech.
101,5f6c2f4f7da9e46ccbe156be,Pricing of New-Tech or cutting-edge Rubbers,"It must be cheaper to make, as the cost price from the manufacturer is cheaper for the G4 compared to the G3."
101,5f6c2f4f7da9e46ccbe156be,Pricing of New-Tech or cutting-edge Rubbers,It's not clear if the G4 is factory tuned (although it certain smelled like it to me!
101,5f6c2f4f7da9e46ccbe156be,Pricing of New-Tech or cutting-edge Rubbers,"), but the G3 make s big deal out of the tuning on the packge, whereas the G4 doesn't."
101,5f6c2f4f7da9e46ccbe156be,Pricing of New-Tech or cutting-edge Rubbers,I guess the performance will tell us once people have tried it.
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"It's been a while since I bought any Tenergy, but I remember them definitely not being vacuum packed."
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"I don't know if there were holes in the plastic, but it was just normal sealed plastic."
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"The only rubbers I have had so far which were actually vacuum packed and not just sealed, were my Yin He Moon Pro."
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"Thanks, that makes me feel much better.It is sealed plastic, just with a few holes punched in it.Would you think that it could stay on the shelf for 2-3 weeks until I get my Ross Leidy blade?"
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,Dan2105 is right.
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,The holes are also standard for the packaging.
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,Okay.How long can it sit for?Thanks!
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"I would guess that in a cool place, at least a year, probably several years."
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"If they are indeed tuned (I think they are) there may be some slight drop-off in performance, but it's not likely to happen for months."
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"Remember they sit on the manufacturer and them the distributor/retailer shelves for some time before they're sold already, so they can't afford to make them to go off too quickly."
102,5f6c2f687da9e46ccbe156d1,Are Tenergies or other Butterfly rubbers vacuum packed?,"As haggisv said, as long as you store them in a cool dry place and sealed in their packaging, there is no reason why you couldn't wait a few weeks to use them."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I am curious as well
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I will be trying Donic Traction Ms pro in the next week.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'll post a review as soon as I get some non-robot based play:)
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Well Teddy please let me know what you think of the new set up.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Might be at the club on Sat instead of Sunday.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Im still going with the same setup.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I know you will stay with the DTECS on the BH.. will hit with you soon.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Multi ball training next month after I get some more balls From TGPeace GIG
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,This is interesting:)I'm going to give a full review but here are my initial impressions of the rubber.It is not nearly as hard as it is advertised to be.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It seems chinese when you look at the packaging.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Then you open it and take it out.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's tacky but only a little.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's got a pink ""factory tuned"" sponge and is quite nice looking against a black topsheet."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I had a short hit with the robot.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's spinney, and pretty fast."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"A little slower than tenergy, but a robot can't help me determine that."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I can say the top sheet feels like tenergy...maybe slightly more tacky, and the sponge has to be around the 37 degree butterfly mark."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It loops well off of the robot.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I hit about 100 balls and missed about 10-12, all off the end cause I was trying to see how high and low I could loop to determine the throw angle."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I'd say it's medium, but I also need a training session to determine that.I noticed chen weixing was using a rubber with a similar sponge in another tread on this forum, and I could see this being the rubber."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Whether it was made by haifu or not, it feels like a euro chinese hybrid, like tenergy."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I've tried tenergy, vega pro, vega europe, bryce speed, top energy soft, barracuda, haifu blue whale II, hurricane II & III (neo/provincial), all the srivers, mark V, JO waldner, All the tensor coppa's."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Traction MS pro so far feels like a slightly tacky tenergy top sheet and a medium chinese tuned sponge...it is not hard, it is not soft (but for a chinese rubber yes it is softer).If this rubber produces as much spin as it is advertised to have, or even 95% of the spin tenergy 05 produces I have a feeling it will be a loopers dream."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'll give a full review of this rubber tuesday night.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Got a chance to see one today from a friend, ita a Haifu Shark 2 or 3 with a mid hard pink sponge, 100% sure it's a shark, hit a few ball with it, not worth the $55, I rather get the shark, he also said, he left it out for a few mins and it expanded by a few inches"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"If it's a higher quality version of the Shark II or III, that would not be so bad...Can you explain that please, I don't get it?"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I've never tried shark...I'm pretty sure it isn't though.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's tack is very small, and the top sheet after a second hit with the robot has a very donic like feel...The sponge could be the same, but It doesn't quite feel like any of the Haifu rubber I've tried."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Also I bought mine for 45 at Americantabletennis.com Maybe if I try shark sometime I'll be able to confirm it, but from what it looks like I'm most likely either sticking with this rubber, or going back to giant dragon top energy."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,What's your impression of the topsheet?
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Is it thin, soft and elastic or is it quite stiff?"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Me either.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The topsheet is elastic...Like a donic rubber with a little added tack....the sponge is not hard....I don't understand the marketing on this thing...If you've played tenergy 05 and coppa jo gold....the topsheet is kinda somewhere between the two in elasticity and feel with very very minor chinese like tack...It seriously hardly feels chinese.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,you know how donic rates the numbers on there rubber like s1 as hard s2 medium s3 as soft....I'd say its a s2 or s3 chinese rubber...a true hybrid...I wonder if I'll get the benefits that I've found from chinese rubber.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I feel like when I play with chinese rubber the rallys are shorter, but thats not a bad thing.When I play jap/euro rubber the rallys are longer and I have better control on my loop.I want both....but I guess I just gotta train cause no matter what rubber I use."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If I can't keep the ball on the table that day it doesn't really matter.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,How about we compare pictures of Shark II and this rubber to finally once and for remove the 1% doubt that they are the same thing
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Thanks tabesamis!Yes it still does sound like Shark II (or III) to me... this rubber also hardly feels like a Chinese rubber.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Ok. As promised here's my review of Shark III ....I mean Donic Traction MS PRO.As already said it's a slightly tacky factory tuned ""hard"" sponged rubber.As I previously told you It's not hard....In fact I'm not sure if its the top sheet or the tuning, but I find it slightly mushy."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'd put it at a 35.8 degree??
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"?....not as hard as tenergy but not really soft either.Here are my impressions by shot.serve: It has enough spin to load up on the serves, but not quite as much as a chinese rubber, or tenergy 05."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The fact that it didn't spin as much actually confused my opponents.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'm not sure why.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Maybe its my blade.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Either way it serves fine.THrow angle: I'd put it at just below medium.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"You can loop most things over the net, but all the heavy backspin shots I looped clipped the top of the net, probably because I normally use a tacky rubber, and when I used to use Tenergy 05 the thing had a really high throw angle, so that could be me, but it doesn't launch shots high.Loop vs block: This is where the rubber shines."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"You can loop, and loop, and loop , and loop."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Its rather easy, and when an opponent blocks it's a good thing for you.Counterlooping: This is also really the best part of the rubber."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's easier than with the chinese rubber I was using.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It really good though.pushing: It isn't too fast that you don't have any touch.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Does it shine in this area????
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,no.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"But it will get you to the point where you can either loop, or counter loop.Blocking: I really thought this would be an area that this rubber would be great, but I'd say it's only average."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's not horrible, but not great."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Disclaimer: blocking is the worst part of my game, but I've had better blocking results with several other sheets.chopping: Strange...you can chop with this rubber."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's not too bad.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Its not made for chopping I'm just saying you can.Overall: Donic Traction Ms pro is a very good rubber for looping.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The lower throw angle makes me think this would be a good backhand rubber for a two wing looper.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If I was still doing that I'd choose this for my backhand.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I'd give this rubber a 8 out of 10 primarily because even though it loops well, it doesn't produce as much spin as I'd want out of it."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,And there is nothing spectacular about his rubber other than it's looping ability.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If there's anything else you want to know.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Ask:)
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Thanks a lot tabesamis, great review!Was there any evidence that this rubber was tuned, like an oily residue on the sponge?When I used the Shark II, i found it to be quite bouncy for the short game... and this seemed to get worse over time (possible as the tuning effect wear off)."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Did you find this on the Traction as well?I assume the Traction Pro Soft will be even softer...
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I think the only indication of the tuning was the packaging.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It came vaccum sealed with the normal cover over the sponge.I did find the tack wore off quite quickly which could be a good or bad thing depending on your rubber preference.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It was quite bouncy in the short game but for your traditional two winged looper I don't think this would be a problem, because it would provide enough control to play a backhand control game that would consist or more flips than pushes.Also the sponge didn't really dome as much as the pics of shark in the forum....Maybe the effects wouldn't deteriorate as fast with use...I'm not really sure because though I may like it for looping it wasn't as effective against underspin (looping underspin) as I'd like when I came back to the table from chopping with my backhand."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'd say it was a waste of 45 bucks for me but I'll probably get a return from it by selling it on a newer blade.Overall great for looping topspin.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Ok for looping underspin...Good for hitting...other than that everything is just average.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Assuming Shark II on medium red sponge is the same as the pro rubber, it's not very bouncy, just a nice amount and about the same as Hexer except with less dwell since the sponge is harder."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Red top sheet visually is clear and the same colour as Hexer, it's non tacky and the pimples are larger than Hexer."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"One thing about the top sheet is that it's very thin, almost paper thin, about 1/3rd the thickness of hexers sheet."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It's also made from a very crumbly rubber, performance rather than long life was the goal when they designed this rubber.I'm quite excited about the rubber because it feels like it's going to be a total weapon, I'll play a few hours on it tomorrow and update then, hopefully it doesn't fall to bits"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Tried the Shark II red sponger, it works good."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"By hard rubber standards Shark is a very soft and dynamic rubber but it's still harder, faster and louder than Hexer."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I feel more confidant with it than the soft jello like feel of Hexer, Shark feels more stable.. yet it's a bit wild, it's very stinky too lol, my whole car smells like downtown Tianjin China."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I was tired today so couldn't play very well today no matter what I was using so it's a little hard to say just yet how good the rubber is but so far it's does everything you need a rubber to do.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It's much easier to loop with for me for than Hexer and Shark is lower throw and I much prefer that in the rubber than high throw.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,What I can't test out how well it blocks just because I don't have anyone good enough to practice with.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I have some more things to try tomorrow on the forehand and I'll use Shark on the BH to see how lazer like it is once I've had some sleep
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The stink is a bit of a worry... not sure if it's would pass the VOC test if it smells that strong...
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"It actually doesn't actually say anywhere on the packet that it's voc free or under any value, my eye hurts if I look in the packet lol"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Shark II red sponger is turning out to be the best forehand offensive rubber I've used, I'm not sure how many people will be able to lift it but it's deadly if you can."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,It doesn't chop so well but it's about perfect for everything else.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"More spin than hexer, more speed and more control, that's about all I can ask for, I haven't torn the top sheet which I'm quite surprised at given how thin it is."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I'm also not sure how long the tuning is going to last.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,If I could buy 3 sheets of it per season and have this performance all season I'd be happy enough
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I just cut a sheet of Traction MS soft.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The topsheet is certainly not as fragile as the sheets of Shark that I tried (a while ago now)...
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I could stretch it to about double the size before it snapped.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Sponge feels nice and soft.Instruction tell you to remove plastics sheets from both the topsheet and sponge, and leave for 10mins before gluing to the bat."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,They also said to apply glue only to the blade... so I guess the glue layer on the back is enough to make it stick.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Hopefully!I am considering ms soft and xiom omega iv elite (or a newer elite if they come out with one) on the fh side of the Ross Leidy blade that I will get in 6 months.Hope to hear how it plays, and whether or not the rubber will even stick!And just curious, how tacky is it?It sounds like it can be a massively spinny rubber!"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Hey Haggisv, did ms soft stick?If so, have you played with it and how has it played?"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Stick to the blade?
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Yes no problems sticking it down... it comes flat out of the packet.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,That's good!Hope that it plays well
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I bought a used sheet of Donic Traction MS Soft.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The sheet had no glue layer on the sponge anymore but apart fromthat it looks like new..Topsheet is red and the sponge yellow.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,As I had the rubber in my hands my first thought was : Its a Shark II (also a yellow sponge in the first version) My current shark is a training version and came without the glue layer on the sponge 35°Then I got my shark II out of the stash and compared it.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"All I can say is: the sponge is the same (color, texture and density-shark 35°) as my shark II ,but the topsheet is a bit different: The shark topsheets pimpels are just a fraction smaller in diameter and it is more translucent then the Donic Topsheet."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,They are both very thin and I can not say if one is thinner or not.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,The look the same thickness to me!The bounce on the blade is very good and you can feel the glue effect.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I will have a hit with it in the next few days and give you some more impressions.I will also give comparison with a Palio Blitz 47,5° as it is on the backside of the blade..."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"That will be great, thanks teplan!"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Sorry for the delay..I had a hit with it for a half an hour.. Then I removed it  If any of you had this training version of a shark without the glue layer, you`ll now why!IMO its a good rubber to loop but thats all."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"The sponge, even in 2,1mm bottoms out quite easily,Spin I found is a bit less than with shark and serves are no good..It might differ with a black topshet and of course the glue layer does a big difference too !!"
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,!It had nothing to do with my first sheet of shark II (black with glue layer) but is very simmilar to the Shark training version I have now sitting in my rubber box.So I am trying to get rid of it
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"I had a hit with it today, with a sheet of Calibra LT on the other side of a Donic Burn OFF- blade, so I can offer some comparisonsCalibra was a little faster and quite a bit softer, and although both have high glue feel, it's stronger and louder on the Calibra."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Of course the glue feel is always stronger on softer sponge, so that would explain it."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"Calibra's throw was a little higher, but both lifted backspin effortlessly and counterloop very nicely."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,I did not really experience the bottoming out for my loops.Blocking was very good with both too.
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,"In the short game the Donic clearly outperformed, as the Calibra is much more bouncy making it harder to keep the ball low.Serving was very good with both...both generate heavy spin easily, although with the Donic it's a little easier to serve slower balls and probably a little easier to generate the spin.If I had to chose, I'd personally choose the Calibra, but that depends on your own game."
104,5f6c2f937da9e46ccbe156ed,Donic Traction MS Pro/Soft rubbers,Maybe you need to do a review of the Donic Burn now Haggisv
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"For a beginner it doesn't really matter, any combo out of the blades/rubbers you recommended would work."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"I'd stick with something really cheap and versatile for a beginner, so he can find out what style he likes and when he gets better he can pick something that suits his game more."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,Allround Classic with some softer less tacky Chinese rubber like the Focus 3 Snipe.
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,He wants a very spinny and fun setup for $60?
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,It's right in my sig  LKT Ayous Hinoki FL $22Palio Thors $30LKT Pro XT $8Plus a few extra $$ for shipping.
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"The Thors and XT are at ttnpp, and the Ayous Hinoki is at zeropong."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"Now whether or not it would be appropriate for your friend, that's maybe a different question..."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"But if he has someone that can work with him and show him how to stroke correctly, it's a very fun racket.You can even go cheaper than that if you go for the custom racket combos at zeropong."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"For example, $42 plus shipping gets you the Ayous Hinoki and two sheets of H3 Neo (a $66 value), or Ayous Hinoki and Red Diamond / Black Power, or Ayous Hinoki and two sheets of Pro XT, etc."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,Don't forget to give your friend the proper sponge thickness for his optimum performance and learning
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"Don't worry, I was not going to!How about this:LKT Ayous HinokiFH: LKT Red DiamondBH: Gambler WraithZeropong didn't list hurricane 3 neo as an option in the combo."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"Oh I guess you're right, it must be only for the $14 rubbers and under."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"Otherwise it would be quite a steal!I bought the Ayous Hinoki with Red Diamond on the FH for my dad, and then again for two of his friends, everyone seems very happy with it, and it seemed to be very nice to play with when I had a short hit."
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,Never played with Gambler Wraith.
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,I was under the impression that the wraith was hard to control...
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,Probably not the best for a beginner.Edit: My mistake that is the gambler outlaw.
105,5f6c2fb47da9e46ccbe15700,A blade / rubber combo for my friend,"Alright, I'll tell him to either get cream transcend or cream magic red sponge as the rubbers."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Although not in your list Tibhar Nimbus Sound is very popular around here for exactly the game you describe.Of the 3 rubbers you list, I've no experience of Boost."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Calibra is probably quicker than Tenergy with a corresponding drop in control.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Thanks
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"I use Boost TS and it is very soft , it is very good for looping and it is fast, but not extremely fast, the control is good as I can block with it and can chop it with my forehand."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,I chose the 1.7mm thickness if that helps.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,This rubber is very spinny too.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Yes I know Boost TS,really soft and good for looping but the bad side is it is not long lasting rubber but not as expensive as tenergy.Thanks"
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"I've had boost TS since October, and it's still serving me very well, the edge of the rubber starts crumbling but it hasn't changed its performance, especially since I never clean my rubber."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Sorry for the misunderstanding when I say not long lasting I mean crumbling of the edges,not its performance.And especially because of the the careless usage of young players it easily crumb.Thanks"
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Hallmark Powerspin is a typical Chinese hard tacky rubber.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,I suggest to make a step up with something like LKT Red Diamond.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"I'm 16 so I fall into the careless category  but the crumbling around the edges are minimal and it really doesn't effect your game, especially if you put edgetape around the bat."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,I ordered LKT Rapid Speed rubber.Because Red Diamond was sold in Presport.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Rapid is still chinese, which doesn't really provide optimal speed."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,If your student is a Junior I don't think one can go wrong with Tenergy 05.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"I've played very few sheets of rubber that have the overall spin, speed, and control of Tenergy 05."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,It's very balanced.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,If I was rich I'd still be using it.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Since I am not Top energy soft is the one for me.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Thanks...
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,I disagree with Tenergy 05.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Tenergy is a rubber which forces you to play active, which is great for pros, not so great for people who are still learning."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"A better choice would be Hexer, Genius or Baracuda."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Those rubbers may not have the extreme spin of Tenergy, but still very good spin, and during passive situations they play pretty good."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Thanks ...
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,I hated Hexer for fast close to the table hitting style.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,The throw and dwell time is too high.I like LKT Rapid Speed for its low throw (= low spin sensitivity).
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"It is very durable, better then many others in wet and dirty conditions."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Red LKT Rapid Speed is my favorite inverted rubber so far.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Did you try Hexer+?
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,It is lower throw and would be a lot faster than Rapid Speed.
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,Hexer + ...ok
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Sorry, but is this for you or your student?Andro Hexed HD is a very nice rubber, from what I understand about the same speed as hexer+ (not sure though) with more spin."
106,5f6c2fc87da9e46ccbe1570c,Hallmark Powerspin or Butterfly Tenergy 05 orStiga CalibraLT,"Either way, + or HD would probably be good choices."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Didn't I answer this in your Ultimate Looping thread?XP is my preference as its a bit softer, a bit faster when hitting and not tacky, whereas XT is tacky.If you are brush looping a deriving speed from spin kick on table more than brute speed, XT may be better, but XP will service a Euro loop well still."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I have a red Pro XT, and it's the least tacky rubber out of all the tacky rubbers I've used."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,I can't really imagine the XP being less tacky than that unless it's completely non-tacky like say a Tenergy.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I haven't used the XP before as you can see, but based on reviews by people who've used both, there doesn't appear to be any significant difference."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"For some Chinese rubbers the black one is tackier, so maybe you need to watch out for that."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,I'm 95% sure that you'll be fine with either choice.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"the black xp is less tacky than the red xt,just about right imo"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,thats odd.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,usually the black version of all rubber is tackier.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,THe difference between the two gets less as the rubber wears in.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I've found that there is more difference between batches of the same rubber, than there is between XP or XT."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Thankyou for the responseRebornTTEvnglist: I made this thread so that I could get multiple opinions on the matter, sorry about that."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"And thanks for the reply.haggisv: I guess this wont be a problem then, thankyou for the help.Others: You all speak of the tackiness of these rubbers, however I was under the impression that XP was not meant to be tacky?"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Ian told my that non tacky rubbers were better for away table looping.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,From speed vs control point of view I could say that LKT Pro XT has more control due to increased spin but it has chinese rubber characteristics with Euro/Jap softness.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,LKT Pro XP is meant for speed and its very bouncy.I just love the control I get from my friend's LKT Pro XT slapped on his Donic Burn All+Both of them have great speed and but the sponge in XT is somehow a bit dead so it do absorb the pace on non active strokes whereas the LKT Pro XP will bounce the ball real fast.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"However, this means that the ball will dwell more in the XT's sponge (even tho it is a tad harder) and produces more spin."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"For topspin, the more the topspin, the faster the ball will drop."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Combined with its slowish characteristic, it is my next choice of controlled attack rubber.Would love to buy a sheet of LKT Pro XT black in 2.0mm thickness for my next rubber.Will give a review later on but for now if you want to emphasize more on control, XT would your best choice."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Oh my now im confused...
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I was told that they were both slow rubbers, and that the XP sponge was softer."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"They are not that fast, but with a fast blade you'll get good speed even at lower gears, since the sponge is fairly soft."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I have a galaxy 896, so its not very fast, I was hoping to get more spin and control then speed, because this blade is to improve my skills, not smash winners."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Yeah, it actually depends much on the blade."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Most rubber do, esp."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,the ones with softer sponge.Maybe I could get a good speed because of my friend's Donic Burn All+ blade.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"XT black is a great rubber, stays tacky if you look after it as you should with tacky rubbers, i use it on a slow, soft JTHWS blade and it is fast enough when i want it to be, but gives great control and is low throw - you will not be disappointed with this on your 896."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"The red was a slight bit less tacky, but not too much!"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"It is a very accurate rubber on my combo.The sponge is yellow and has gears, think it is the same as in the 729 lightning!"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"It has a spring like quality and absorbs a lot in passive mode but gives you a kick in active mode.It is a serve's dream and has gears for all round shots from chop, push to topspinWhen i put this on a balsa blade it is too fast and goes long with my normal stroke.XP is a totally different beast ( no tack ) higher throw and we did not like, ughhhhhh!"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,You dont like the xp?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I hope it works out fine for me, I recently had high throw rubbers so it will ease the transition, so it might be a good thing."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"probably shouldn`t say this but the xp reacts well to booster,too slow for me without"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,IMHO LKT Pro XP requires fast and hard blade like typical Chinese one.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Particularly I did not like it's pillow feel on LKT Instinct blade.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,I plan to use this with galaxy 896 which really is not hard at all...
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"If u use it on that blade, the feel will be very mushy"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Mushy?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,I am not sure if that will be a good thing or a bad thing.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Will it have good control and spin?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,That is all I am looking for.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Speed is unnecessary.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Mushy = bad!
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,= no control!
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I doubt it would feel mushy, but the feeling might not be very direct."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I haven't used an 896, but I have used an N9 briefly (and still have a brand new one in its box somewhere laying around  ), which I believe is a similar blade."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"To me, its a horrible feel, kind of spongy and yes control was poor."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I don't recall the rubbers I had on it, I think I sold it to someone wanting a cheapy setup, which is why I bought another, in case someone else wanted one."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,I think it would require thin sponge rubbers with fairly hard sponges to feel half decent.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Man you think those blades are bendy I can play this song on mine http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRyd6flQ ... re=related
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Not bendy, just soft!Which blade are you talking about?"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,The OSP?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Yeah!
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"it gets more bendy with each passing day :9, I wonder how it will be like a few years from now."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Like a worn out Stiga allround I guess, those things loop like a handful of spaghetti"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,So get a REAL blade   My suggestion would be a Gergely!
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"In short, usually the best playing setup one have is a combination of a med-hard blade with med-soft rubber or a med-soft blade with med-hard rubber.Is it true ?"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Or maybe playing style is a major factor?For me a hard blade with hard rubber (Tibhar Phantom X with Nianmor RED MAX) is very hard to loop with unless you play 1m~ away from the table.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"But for hitting, its boss"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,So I cannot put soft with soft now?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,What would be a better option to put my two XP rubbers on then?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"I want something not too expensive (over 35$), and I am looking for excellent control and spin."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Speed is not a factor at all.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Since I have to do this, what would be some great looping rubbers to put on my 896 then?"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Stop stressing about equipment, yours is fine."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"The feel of a setup is a very personal choice, decided by both the player's playing style and pure personal preference."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"A ""mushy"" blade can be very good at looping and the short game, but they're generally not good for blocking and hitting."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"If Robot Blocker, as his name suggests, is a blocker, then it would be natural for him to prefer a harder blade as they do block more precisely."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"A soft and flexible setup has very good control and spin for loops, but as you step up in level and need more speed, then your shots will need to have more hitting components to them(e.g."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"loop drives, counter hits, etc.)."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"THEN, harder setups will be more useful."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Unless you become a hitter/blocker, then hard and flexy setups will be the way to go once you reach that level."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,re blade vs rubber combos.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,for anyone still learning and discovering what kind of player they will be it's best to use a not very flexible soft allround 5 ply (mushy blade).
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Once you get enough skill to engage in long distance rallys you will want to or need to move to a thin flexible blade, if you decide you will play offensively near the table you might be better with a hard feel 7 ply like a clipper with softer rubbers."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"The thicker 7 plys don't need heavy rubbers since they don't rely so much on flex, the harder thin and flexible 5 plys do need heavier rubber to induce the flex which lets them play so far from the table."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,I bet the XT and XP would play great on a Clipper but it'll be too fast for a intermediate player unless they are offensive on every shot.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,There are plenty of blades somewhere in the middle of all this but that's the basics.The type of blade that seem to have no point in life are the soft 7 plys like Joola Viva or something like that
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Mid distance looping is the only thing I am good at (well for my level anyway), the combination overall only cost about 30$, so it wont hurt to try!"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"If it does not work, I can merely replace the rubbers"
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Of course it won't.

107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,What is important is getting something that reasonably suits you and practice with it.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Do I recall you saying you get about 2 hours of practice every day?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,You will grow in the game at a good rate if you keep this up.
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Who do you practice against, that is part of the key!"

107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,Do you suggest for me to designate a single person?
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"No, a range of people is good."
107,5f6c2fd37da9e46ccbe15712,LKT Pro Xt or XP?,"Although the better your opponent, the better you will be forced to be yourself."

109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Yes Pronte was my first thought too.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"All the 999 variants are right up there too, higher throw than the Tenergies."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Palio Thor's should probably be on the list.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,It's got what I consider a low/medium throw.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Baracuda Big Slam.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,T05FX has a long trajectory.Sent from my Android phone
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Thor's => okTenergy => sureGenius => !

109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Any DHS rubber that's tacky and has a softer sponge (35 degrees)
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"H3 #19 is a lot softer, but it seems to be discontinued as I was designed to be tuned."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"im pretty sure eacheng still stock the old #19 sponged hurricanes, my friend might have the #19 sponge rubbers( about 10 of em)also blitz seems like a relatively high throw, well maybe only med high but it seems to have the spin"
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Yes I know it's still available in quite a few places, but I personally would not want to change to a rubber that's discontinue, knowing that I might not be able to get it in future..."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,What about regular Barracuda?
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Still high but not quite as high...
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Dawg!
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,There was no mention of speed...BTY Tackiness Drive has a very high throw but only medium speed.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Dawei Super Power 2008 XP has a very high throw, with medium speed also, a bit faster than the Tackiness Drive."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"palio cj8000 but classic sponge series (not biotech or tension)...highest throw, very spinny, very slow!"
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,(sorry but it does go along with highest throw and spin )
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Thanks guys.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Slower rubbers are fine, just looking at high throw and spinny."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Does Tackiness drive play like tackiness chop at all?
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"I believe it has a harder sponge, not sure about anything else."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Hexer hasn't been mentioned here.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,It is said to be rather high throw in the regular version.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Tackiness Drive plays much different than Tackiness Chop.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Yes, it has a medium density sponge that is harder than Chop's soft sponge."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Chop is much better for chopping......Drive is much better for driving.........   Actually , my experience was that Drive had such a high throw angle that I was over hitting the table against topspin, but I was a less advanced player 5 years ago when Drive was my main rubber."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,The high throw angle of Drive was really noticeable when blocking.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,It probably is a good medium speed rubber for looping.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Thanks glennholder for the info on Tackiness Drive...
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Thanks to everyone for all info given  .I don't know if it would make the list of 5 highest, but I tested Xiom Vega Pro for a few weeks in 2.0 and it seemed pretty high throw to me."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Honestly probably the best rubber to me for away from the table looping (maybe 4 to 8 ft back).
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,I couldn't miss the table.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Nice arc when looping, would come slamming down hard onto the table."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,However at the table was a different story.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,It was to bouncy for me to control it well.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Even serve return was hard against good servers that served short, not forgiving at all."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,It's probably my skill level mostly.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Maybe in the (far) future I can revisit this one.
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Not sure how it compares to others listed, but pretty high throw for sure."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"I saw Globe 999 and 999t topsheets at Coles, is this what you mean?"
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,"Sorry, not very familiar with these..."
109,5f6c300c7da9e46ccbe15736,Top 5 highest throw/very spinny rubbers.,Thanks.

110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,perhaps 729- fx el?
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,or geospin or donic akkadi taichi?
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"If we knew what the rubber was like, we might be able to offer some alternatives."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,that sounds a tad harsh..
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Sorry, I did not mean it that way at all."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"All that I meant was that if you know what the rubbers plays like, let us know, so that we can suggest something similar."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,no worries.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"anyway after only every playing with my friends setup it boats lots of control , seems very insensitive to spin( its also quite worn, very smooth and not realy grippy nor tacky at this stage)."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,heavy chops or fast pushes seem easy to controll/deal with.from his point of view as said before he tends to chop or push agressively most of the time.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"and he send them very deep, while some of the time the ball doesnt seem to have much spin on it the ball still travels quite fast and low"
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,RITC 804?
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,$10 per.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Something like GD Submarine or Gambler reflectoid, with a thin sponge perhaps?"
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,I have briefly played with this rubber and I can DEFINITELY say it is nothing like 804!Most of the older defensive guys play with it (very well) on 50 year old bats.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,With the right placement it can still be attacked with.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,1.3 sponge is usually the sponge of choice I believe.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,I can't say there is much out there that would play very similar to it.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Reflectoid may, but I've not used it to compare."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"As you say decoy it is a slow, very controlled rubber."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,Not something that I take very much notice of  The closest I can think I have used to it in memory would possibly be 729 FX Blue Sponge 1.5.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,I think it may suffice.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,Donic akadi taichi is quite a bit faster than the Super Defense 40 soft and Geospin is much harder.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"I agree with haggisv, Giant Dragon Submarine or Gambler Reflectoid are decent replacements."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"But, they are both harder than Super Defense 40 soft.Stiga Chop & Drive is softer than the Reflectoid or the Submarine, The Chop & Drive is 60% the price of the Super Defense, the Submarine and Reflectoid are 40% the price."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,A close thing to Super Defense 40 soft in a Chinese rubber would be to get Cole Ely in the USA to put a 1.5mm Dawei Butter sponge (30 degrees) under a LKT Pro XT topsheet.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,Cole's price would be about $15 US but he is indeed far away.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,He probably mails around the world.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Heck, my shipments from Eacheng in China cost only $3 more to ship to me in Canada than I pay for shipping from the USA!"
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Spinlord Marder.VERY nice bh rubber, very insensitiveto spin, non-tacky, but quiet grippy.http://www.ttdd.de/Spinlord3.htmlCheersGeddk"
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Wanna buy Tibhar SD like 4 months ago but I choose LP instead haha.Anyway, I don't know much about this rubber and when I asked in another forum, they reccomend me Donic Quattro A'conda Soft."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,I am playing often against defensive players using Tibhar SD 40.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,Very difficult to play against especially when it is in skillful hands.
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Tons of control,backspin and often unpredictable behavior when used with tiny sponge like 0.5 or 0.9 ."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"I can't compare it to any chinese I know except Reflectoid, or Submarine, (which I've never tried or played against)  The closest I know is Donic Slice 40, also very popular among the defenders here."
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"i guess i might jsut buy an assortment of rubbers again, it should suit em"
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,"Or cheap-n-tacky chinese rubber.They are good for chopping, well if it suits you"
110,5f6c30107da9e46ccbe15738,Tibhar Super defence 40/soft,cheap n tacky may work but for these players they are used to their rubbers being insensitive to spin
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,XP and XT are both a bit slower that Red Diamond and Black Power and XP and XT both have a medium throw angle and Red Diamond and Black Power both have a low throw angle.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,XT is tackier than XP.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Red Diamond and Black Power don't have much tack but can generate good spin.All 4 of these rubbers have very nice quality topsheets.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"i was actualy surprized how well either the xp or xt played, when i had a quick go at it, it has a nice feel it it and response"
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"The Pro Xp, and Xt are both very spinny, and have a softer topsheet and sponge from what I remember."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,The Red Diamond I have only played with as used.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I actually really like the sponge on the Red Diamond.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I think they have something there.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"However I think they either need to put more tack that will stay with the rubber for a longer period of time, or give it about a 5 degree softer topsheet."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,It's just not able to do anything with the ball at low pace once the tack is all gone.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,It really performs with full strokes though.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Decoy said:I totally agree.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I played with the XP and felt the quality immediately.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"Two guys in my club were curious, they both use various versions of DHS H3."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"We bounced the ball side by side on the two H3's and the XP was a bit faster than the H3's and the XP and H3's all had a similar feel to the spin, all 3 rubbers create easy and effective spin."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,The topsheet on the XP is softer than Chinese sheets have historically been.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,The XP also proved to be durable.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I liked the XP so much that I experimented with it and XT by buying the topsheets and gluing thinner sponges under the topsheets to aid my chopping.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"I haven't used black power or red diamond, but I have used XP and XT (the gold and silver dragon versions)."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I thought the XP was a wonderful piece of rubber for a chinese rubber.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,It had awesome control and decent speed (until I found tensors  ).
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I still have an unopened sheet laying around somewhere.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I really should try it again and see how it compares with my Hexer+.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,how did the xt/xp special sponges fair??...
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"this rubber is quite something it almost felt like T05 but less catapult and lighter and slower, but had that solid feel when using TBH"
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Didn't like XT much.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,XP was special.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,But I never tried the normal sponges.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"The biggest difference is that XT/XP is a LOT softer than the Red Diamond.And I agree with Skippy, once the topsheet of the Red Diamond loses it tack, it becomes a whole lot harder to control."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"I had the XP topsheet glued onto a 1.2mm Dawei Butter sponge (super soft, 30 dehree sponge, done by Cole Ely) The topsheet is so soft and accurate, I wanted to see if I could create a Chinese version of Butterfly Tackiness Chop."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,It was a huge success.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,It felt like Tackiness Chop to me.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"(although I had only owned Tacki Chop in a 1.7, so the comparison was not exactly on par) I might go back to it, but for now I'm using an Air Zero super slow and hard sponge for my inverted sheet."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"had a good hit around with the Red Diamond on a Galaxy W6 blade.i take it the rubber needs a good break in unlike the xp/xt rubbers, as a simple bounce test showed that the ball clinged onto the rubber and died out very fast like it would with H3.so far counter hitting and blocking was very precise and easy with RD, rubber altogether felt quite hard, H3 hard if not harder, quite close to H2 then again if not more.. it felt quite tacky/sticky( fresh h3 or 729-05 have that feeling)but it didnt react to oncoming spin like H3 would the ball seemed to stay a lot lower kinda like H2 but not as viciousalso its quite heavy heavier than H3.it generated good spin, but it didnt come as naturally as it would have with xp/xt..will have to see what its like after it gets broken in proper, if it requires it that is."
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Red diamond is a good rubber.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Consistent with a med throw and a very linear response.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Good spin.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Not tenergy spin but more than an all rounder.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,it is really hard though as advertised.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,Only drawback is the sponge is of low quality and crumbles a little if you take the rubber off a thickly glued blade.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,I wouldn't say Red Diamond has a low quality sponge rather is made from a different kind of stuff that happens to break more easily than most sponge.
111,5f6c30267da9e46ccbe15746,LKT pro Xp/Xt/red diamond,"It's similar/same to the sponge on Mercury II if you have a Merc II in 38-40+ degree, neither sponge will break if you glue with rubber cement and don't pull the rubbers off like a crazy man with roid rage"
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,My whole setup doesn't cost $80.
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,The price of that rubber is insane.
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,"i am using 05 fx on stiga allround classic in 1.7 thickness and it does everything very well,but on a stiffer blade the sponge is too thin and the loop arc is not there,i would imagine that with 05 regular in 1.7 thickness this would follow also"
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,"i bought tenergy 64 2.1mm about 6 months ago, after 33-4 months of playing with it loops were impossible, all spin was lost, it is an incredibly non-durable rubber."
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,"But the speed was still there, but the rubber wasn't for me."
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,T05 on the other hand 2.1mm is a god save for looping but after 3-4 months you notice a definate lose in grip.
112,5f6c30577da9e46ccbe15765,Tenergy 1.7mm or 2.1mm,But hey you cant have everything!
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Welcome to the forum!
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"Interesting choice of rubber for chopping  First off, have you tried it with a thinner sponge?"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"Perhaps you shpuld look for a rubber that comes in 1,8 mm or thinner."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Do you prefer a hard or soft sponge?
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,A nice allround rubber (I'm not sure about throw angle or chopping ability) could be Yaska Mark V that comes in several different sponges and as thin as 1.0 mm.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Good luck!
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"mark v was my very first rubber,i will consider going back to it although i prefer something even slowerabout the sponge, well.. i have no idea what EXACTLY the effect of the thickness"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,-footwork-right angle of blade when cutting-1.5 mm yanus def
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Most of the time the thicker the rubber is the faster and harder to control it gets.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Also thinner rubber should generate a little bit more spin.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"I am mostly defender too and I play with 1,5 - 1,7 mm rubbers."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,For past few years I had butterfly tackiness chop.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"Now I am gonna try butterfly spin art (this one is fast, so I don't recommend to you)."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,yea i talked with alot of spin-art players and all of them told me that rubber is extremly hard to control..tackiness chop is what i was thinking too.. but i'm afraid that it will react too much to incoming spin like acuda s1 and similar rubbers
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"One thing for sure, tackiness chop will react to incoming spin, that rubber is very sensitive."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,But there is a good side too: your chops will have lots of spin too.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"And if you adjust your defence motion for that rubber, spin reversal will be insane.. That's a decision you will have to make"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"thx for your replaysi will tell you what =]there is alot of good players there, and i can chop their attacks (but the ball goes really high so they just smash it no matter how much spin i put on) so i did 2 months practicing with one of them trying to figure out how to chop that attack so the ball wont go so high, and i think that its almost impossible..BUTthere is one guy there.. which i cant even put the ball on the table no matter what i'm doing.. he got the ball spin faster then a motorcycle's engine!!!"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"(i assume..  )and i cant change my strokes now.. i need to find a quick solution, i have 3 weeks training before the league start and i must prove myself there..so i need extremly defensive rubber which i can attack once in a whilei even considered short pips (put a topic there already but no answers for now)"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"I understand your problem and I can say that defending with inverted is really tough job, that's why I play with long pips on one side and twiddle the racket whenever I need to  This way I almost don't care how much spin is on the ball if my footwork is good enough."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,ahha!!
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"now you are dragging me to another conversation here =]my twiddle skills are really good, i twiddle like 4-5 times per pointbut that spacific player doesnt care.. his changing direction skills really crazy and not me (or any other player i know) can read which direction he is going to attack.. other players got no problems against him cuz they just use double inverted =/"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,In that case everything looks quite simple to me.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"If you twiddle good then get LP on one side, this will help a lot against many players."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"Also it is natural that some players are very good against defense, so you have to take initiative and attack first, do spiny and slow or fast and powerful loops, flat hit more, disrupt his game-play."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,And if nothing works that just means that at the moment he is at a higher lvl than you are
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"at that moment he is much higher lvl then me XDthe only thing that worked is if i force him to push/chop.. that way i attack with LP and until now he never return it (he doesnt understand why his block goes to the net lol)anyway, i still must change my fh rubber so i will be able to just put the ball back on the table.. right now i cant even do that against him"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,I think Tackiness Chop would be good for this.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,It's not as tacki as Chinese rubber.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Loops are slow and very spinny but this rubber blocks well on my forehand.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,Also stays pretty low and chops well.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,If you don't like this then maybe Tibhar Super Defense 40.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"actually, i manage to put my hands on a brand new tackiness chop 1.7so i tried it out and i must say, that is the solution for all my problems!!!"
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,!i played with that against 2 players at my level and both of them got huge problems reciving my loops (extremly slow loops)and my chops never been so low =]2morrow i will play against our top players and see how it react
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"Tackiness Chop is a good rubber, very spinny."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"Hope it goes well tomorrow, let us know  ."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"globe 999 has a pretty medium throw and midium speed, i've defend with it before lps were banned in my country and i had to give up defence."
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,i didn't hav problems with incoming spin.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,another rubber i've defend with was tackifire special soft which was a bit spinnier and i still didnt hav problems dealing with incoming spin.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,if u r looking for a non tacky / spinny rubber then i think it will hardly suit defenders.
113,5f6c305e7da9e46ccbe1576a,def/allround rubber help plz,"dealing with incoming spin is yr job not the rubber's, it might help u a bit but there won't be huge diferences as long as its an inverted rubber."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I just started using H2 Neo after having used Tenergy 25 for 4-5 months and seeing a nice rating boost.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"H2 Neo is upping my rating again, due mainly to its greater consistency: My coaches and opponents tell me I'm simply getting more balls on the table."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"And H2 is clearly harder for opponents to deal with; a quality that's not often talked about when inverted rubber is being discussed (it has to do with H2's ball path and kick off the table, as well as its spin variations).H2 Neo's spin on serve is on par with T25, possibly even stronger."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,H2 Neo starts out tacky but it mostly wears off after 5-6 matches and the speed increases as the tackiness decreases.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,Another FH rubber to consider is DHS Skyline TG3 Neo which I'm currently testing.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Faster and harder than H2 Neo, TG3 Neo is even tackier and seems to have somewhat higher throw, and noticeably more spin on serve.My experience with Palio Thors is mixed."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"I test hit with a brand new sheet some months back and absolutely hated it, as did several other 1800+ players who tried it that day."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"It was very tacky and non-linear, where hard strokes were rockets, but any stroke with less power could unexpectedly land in the net."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Otoh, I tried another player's well broken in Thors -- so much so that it had a dull spot in the hitting zone -- and was astounded at how different it was than the brand new sheet I had tried previously."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"The broken in Thors was, hands down, the best blocking rubber I had ever used: Effortless high-speed blocks off of blistering incoming drives had me instantly grinning."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Linearity was fine, and speed and spin were great."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,But whether I want to endure a break-in period that may be dozens of matches long is something I haven't committed to.. yet.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"You can play well with H2 neo or Thors but they are fairly different rubbers and like nathanso said regarding Thors changing with age the difference between them grows with age, the H2 neo will get slower, Thors will get faster."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"A brand new Thors is still faster than H2 neo will ever be and more spinny but once it's got 30, 40 maybe 50 hours on it, then it's quite fast and also very lively."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I've got a sheet with around 200 hours on it and I still like it more than a new sheet.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"The thing about H2 is that is one of the least side spin reactive rubbers you can get and Thors is possibly the most sidespin reactive rubber you can get, they both make similar topspin but Thors does it more easily and also will curve the ball on sidespin a lot further than H2 can.H2 neo is much easier to control, and again like nathanso said H2 is very difficult for opponents to read the spin and be able to return the ball, because it flys flat with heavy spin it's a very unusual rubber and something almost no one is used to."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I'm not 100% happy with either H2 or Thors as a complete package and both have flaws which you have to play around.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,In the end I can use either H2 or Thors and play at the same level whatever but Thors is a much more powerful rubber and because you can bend the ball around the net at will and win points from full court length + do all kinds of trick stuff so easily it's much more fun to use so I'll choose it over H2 just for the fun factor since it doesn't cost me points although anywhere much below 2000 us level I think you would be better served with H2 just because it's so much easier to control.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Make no mistake Thors is harder to use at full pace than any other tensor and any tenergy, it's very demanding but that seems the price you have to pay for a very powerful tacky rubber.The third rubber nathanso mentioned TG3 is probably the best bet for most people since it more side spinny than H2, not quite as deceptive as H2 but is more easy to use than either Thors or H2, it's actually softer in the top sheet than H2 and has the same sponge so any feeling of it being harder is just go old DHS variation or a harder degree sponge."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"The tackiness varies wildly also, some TG3 are very tacky and some aren't hardly tacky at all, just depends on what day it was made, all the red DHS rubbers are more consistant in this way and I only buy red sheets of DHS rubbers now because of that reason, they tend to be ""just right"", they also last longer The end of the story I think is for you who naturally hits with sidespin.. Buy TG3 neo"
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Thanks for all the input there, especially about the TG3 Neo, I hadn't really considered it."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,It sounds like a happy median.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"I do use a lot of sidespin in my game, being left handed I play into people's crossover point with it."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I also like the price of the neo's over Thors.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"As a reward for another 13 hour work day, I think I'll go ahead and buy me some."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"My experience with Thor, is that it does bottom out and there is no huge power gain from neo."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I dont like it too much.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I don't think that can be a bottoming out feeling... the sponge is simply too hard to bottom out IMO.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"The only time you can ever slightly bottom Thors is counter hitting a very well hit ball as hard as you can, I doubt more than 1% of the table tennis population can achieve that kind of speed, it happens a long time after T05 or any of the other famous tensors, when it does happen you can see the ball fly straighter than usual, normally it ends in a long ball even from full court."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Imho the people that say it bottoms out easily are feeling the rubber and sponge going squirrly because it doesn't bottom out, when you get a rubber and blade combination just right for your power you want it to just kiss the blade on your biggest and best attacking shots, this gives the whole combo a nice stabilising effect and that's what you should always aim for."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,2.1mm T05 will do that just nicely on the FH of a strong looper and I think it's one of the major reasons it's so popular with good players.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,Thors not being able to do that for anyone near mortal is it's only downfall as far as I can tell.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,It needs to be a bit softer or less tension in the sponge .
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"You can still use it just fine as it is as since you only bottom out the really top rubbers on big loops or counter hitting anyway, but it would be just that much better if it was more stable on those mission critical high pressure shots"
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"I used Thors for 6 months plus and liked it, but now I have a coach and he has changed my playing style from driving hard/fast loops to a controlled spinning game on my FH."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I had to go away from THors because it was very inconsistent with that pattern.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"That said, my source of hard sponged kokataku has dried up and I am having bubble problems so I am in search of a new FH rubber."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I recently ordered H2 neo.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"NOt sure why, but I hope it is as this thread suggests."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,I have ordered H3 4 times in the past (last time with neo sponge) and been severely disappointed everytime.
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"DHS, this is your LAST chance."
114,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,TG2neo?
115,5f6c30a47da9e46ccbe1579e,Best Andro rubber for all/off play?,"impuls Speed , Plasma 380 and Roxon 330."
115,5f6c30a47da9e46ccbe1579e,Best Andro rubber for all/off play?,Revofire.
115,5f6c30a47da9e46ccbe1579e,Best Andro rubber for all/off play?,"Very high control, and not quite a bouncy as alot of other tensors."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,Haha.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"The answer to your question is ""it depends..."" There are good players who play with both types and one type isn't better than the other."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,It all comes down which surface favors your own personal style and strokes.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,Overall grippy rubbers are easier to take care of and less sensitive to spin so probably better if you're just getting your strokes grooved.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,what rubbers are you using for the bH.. ive been using Hurricane 3 prov for my FH for sometime now.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"but recently ive been using it for RPB and it seems to work.. as for the hurricane getting dirty, after a few serves breathe on it and wipe with either palm of shirt...as for using Tenergy with cpen.. it just feels weird sometimes, and pushing seem to suck with tennergy.heres a few vids to help youhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F_foPqglJ8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNvamhZp6qQhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFJUWfHG ... re=relatedhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbn3d_Ae ... re=relatedalso sweep and mop your garage get rid of the dust thats going to clog up your hurricane..."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"@mynamenotbob: LOL, taking care of a tacky rubber is like taking care of a baby."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,You have to clean it constantly and then put a diaper(protective sheet) on it.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I am so spoiled from japanese rubbers.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"I guess you're right that for just getting my strokes grooved, grippy rubbers might be best."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"I was just thinking of down the road it would be nice to be used to a tacky rubber, since it's kind of an acquired taste."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I read a post where Silver mentioned it's easier for a player to start on a jap/euro rubber and then switch to tacky rubber later once they've improved their game.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,@decoy: I use a focus 3 snipe for bh.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I agree pushing with tenergy isn't that great at my level.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,Once it's worn out I will have to figure out something else to put on it.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"LoL, I've watched almost all the penhold videos on youtube which is what inspired me on my EJ journey."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,People can make table tennis seem so easy and it's easy to get sucked in and try to emulate them by trying all kinds of rubbers.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,whats the focus like for rpb
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"It took me a while to find a FH rubber for my CPen (close to the table).Try 729-02 new sensors, non-tacky, easy to control, easy and good rubber for close to the table."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"Not expensive, so maybe try the 05 and 08 too and see which one you like."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,There must be one you like out of the 3 for close to the table CPen FH.Snipe III is great for RPB.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,729-05 can be used for BH too.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I like Friendship 729!
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"interesting.. ive been wondering about snipe for a while now...try H3 prov for rpb.. you might like it, especially if you movement is aggressive"
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"Thanks ShaolinTT, I'll look into that.I like Focus 3 Snipe for the value."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I wish they had a 1.8 or 2.0 and I'm not sure if it's the lightest rubber for rpb.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I'm looking into Stiga boost TC for bh.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"According to Silvers rubber mass index, it's one of the lightest rubbers which will help offset the hurricane 3."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"But what do I know, that's another $50."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,isnt there something like IQL-something something something very light rubber?
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,I started out playing very tacky rubbers but switched to grippy a few years ago and like it a lot more.
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"I feel like I have a lot more control, due to less sensitivity to my opponent's spin."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"Granted, I get less spin on serves than I normally would, but I think the benefit of better control, especially when looping against backspin, outweighs the benefits for me."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"My advice would be to ask around with the people that you play with, about what their experience has been and what they think might work the best for you, try one of each kind of rubber and see how you like it."
116,5f6c30c07da9e46ccbe157af,Continue learning technique with grippy or tacky?,"some find returning backspin easier with tacky rubbers( like me) with grippy rubbers i find it harder to return backspin, more effort involved.."
117,5f6c312d220a4650ffffd9b9,"yasaka mark v 1,8mm or 2,00mm",Unless you are predominantly a flat-hitter I would go with the 2mm.
117,5f6c312d220a4650ffffd9b9,"yasaka mark v 1,8mm or 2,00mm",I also recommend the 2.0mm for the 40mm ball of today.
117,5f6c312d220a4650ffffd9b9,"yasaka mark v 1,8mm or 2,00mm","thx for the advice.. honestly myself prefer 2,00mm..but i'm not really sure thx for convince me"
118,5f6c3165220a4650ffffd9de,Tenergy 05 FX / 25 FX and Nimbus Comparison,I would assume (without having tried them) that Nimbus would be quite a bit faster than both of those.
119,5f6c3191220a4650ffffd9fb,LKT Rapid Soft/Sound 1.8/2.0 on a fast balsa blade?,I that would work very well.
119,5f6c3191220a4650ffffd9fb,LKT Rapid Soft/Sound 1.8/2.0 on a fast balsa blade?,will it be fast enough if I mix in some looping?
119,5f6c3191220a4650ffffd9fb,LKT Rapid Soft/Sound 1.8/2.0 on a fast balsa blade?,"Because the balsa rebounds the ball much faster when you hit it harder, the dwell time will be lower on powerloops so you'll likely get less spin."
119,5f6c3191220a4650ffffd9fb,LKT Rapid Soft/Sound 1.8/2.0 on a fast balsa blade?,"So yes you can loop, but it will be more suitable for hitting and blocking."
119,5f6c3191220a4650ffffd9fb,LKT Rapid Soft/Sound 1.8/2.0 on a fast balsa blade?,"You should be able to do slow spinny loops though, as this relies mostly on the rubber."

120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"So Jupiter is the tackiest and fastest, is it best to get in 2.0mm or 2.2mm?"
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,mainly want it for brush looping and still want it to have good spin for serves and good control.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"No, Jupiter is not tacky... look at my post again."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"It's basically non-tacky but very grippy... still very spinny though.I would go for 2.0mm if you need good control, that's still thick enough for brush looping."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,I thought it was very tacky because other people had been comparing it to SP Transcend.Anyway i'll probably try it in 2.0mm as that's what i've got at the moment anyway

120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,So is Jupiter really tacky or just grippy?
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"Saw this on another site;""The tackiness lasted only a couple of hours on the black, then became discolored and lost it's ability to generate much spin."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"I tried putting Spinmax on the black and it didn't help...The red stayed tacky, and it played pretty decent."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,However I thought it was kind of slow.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,This rubber just did not work for me so I ended up by replacing it with something else.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"""HAs anyone played with black and red venus?I've bought a black venus, so I'm hoping this statement isn't true"
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"Lucky it's not a too expensive rubber, so it won't be too bad if anything like that happens."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,I had no trouble with my sheet.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"Yes it does lose most of it's tack in the first session, but this is normal for this rubber."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"It remains mildly tacky if you keep it clean and plastic sheet on when not in use, and even if you don't, the grip is very high and makes very spinny loops."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"I have had 4 sheets of Jupiter (2 red, 2 black) and it is hard to imagine how a rubber could be much tackier than the sheets I had."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"The tack eventually wore off later when I left the rubber uncovered in my bag for a few weeks, but it still plays very well as a grippy rubber even now."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,Maybe there are some variations between batches.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"I've purchased a red Jupiter, so hopefully that tacky for a while, but it's good to know that the Venus and Jupiter are grippy as well.Experimenting with 0.6mm 955 on BH at moment and undecided which rubber I'll put on FH, I've also got a couple of Sprungfeders, (and as our comp isn't associated with Victorian Table Tennis) I might put one of them on FH while I'm still adjusting to the LP and then unleash Jupiter or Venus once I'm confident that I can control the LP."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"I've played 2 weeks comp so far with my new setup Sprungfeder A4 on Fh & 955 0.6mm on BHUsing Lp for first time and still getting used to it, it seems to be making my opponents make more mistakes than I am, as I'm still popping the ball up a bit too much for my liking."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,So hopefully by the time everyone else gets used to the slower pace off my BH I will have mastered LP.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,How long does it usually take to feel realy comfortable playing with LP?
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"Keeping in mind I play 2 singles & Doubles each week, so roughly 1 and a half hours per week depending on length of game, bearing in mind our comp still plays to 21 which I like better anyway."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,very hard to say how long it takes...

120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,I don't think you'll get to a point when you feel you've mastered it.. you'll just get better and better and can control the points better.
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,"Had my first hit with Black 2.0mm Venus (BH) and Red 2.0mm Jupiter (FH) last night.Both felt a little slow - to be expected since the tackiness won't wear out for a while.Venus - I found Venus to be a very good all-round rubber, consistent for chopping and blocking which makes it perfect for my backhand.Jupiter - I had about 10 serves go into the edge of the table last night (all of them topspin serves) so will have to get used to serving."
120,5f6c319d220a4650ffffda01,Galaxy/Milkyway rubbers,I found Jupiter gave me great kick on my loops and all topspin smashes.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,I haven't tried these versions but I am using H2 with the Nittaku NT50 sponge and it plays much better than my DHS Skyline TG3 non-NEO.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,The Nittaku sponge feels a little softer but much livelier.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,I read that the NT50 Hurricane series was made by Nittaku combining many different sponges with the H2 and H3 topsheets to find the best combination.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,I'm sure the H2/H3 Pro went through a similar development path.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,"It's a nice collaboration as DHS makes better topsheets and Nittaku, better sponges."
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,"Unfortunately, the price..."
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,"I currently use H2 ProThey are significantly better than regular commercial, more inline with the provincial version."
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,Not sure how it compares to national.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,Also better than NT50.
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,Can you describe how the H2 Pro feels compared to the H2 NT50?
121,5f6c31b1220a4650ffffda0f,Nittaku H2/H3 Pro,"slightly less sticky, more dynamic, much better sponge"
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,calibra isn't sticky.
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,Not sure if this is factored into your thinking.
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,But yeah Calibra is faster than 999.
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,"Depending on which version of 999, quite a lot of rubbers are faster than 999..."
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,If you like the 999 but just want more speed then you should try Thor's.
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,"Thor's is sticky like 999 and plays similarly to a chinese rubber at the table, but has a ton more speed when you get pushed back."
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,If you're used to Chinese rubbers Thor's will play better for you and require less adjustment than something like Calibra LT.
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,Well... Thx for ur advices... im looking for a good rubber for looping/counterlooping with my FH away from the table (its the main purpose because i dont like to chop with my FH)...
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,I was thinking about using A calibra LT sound but im not sure :S... i think i cant find Thor's at my country :S
122,5f6c31cc220a4650ffffda24,Calibra LT sound/Matsushita Pro,"Thor's is what you want, it's 999 on a big dose of steroids, make sure you use it on a blade that is hard on it's surface, at least koto"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I will bet 10/1 it is your stroke.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"The higher the ball, the higher you start yor stroke."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Picture a straight line from ball to the table, stroke should go in line with that with the bat slightly closed."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I too don't think the sponge thickness has anything to do with you missing the smashes.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Try Hookshot's way and see if it work.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Otherwise, here is another way to deal with high pop up balls.Jim, I hope you play some tennis, that kind of high balls should be finished using the tennis slice serve stroke; start your paddle high and use your forearm, at contact, add the wrist factor."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,The ball will curve floating away to their right after hitting the table.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Even if and when they touch the ball, the ball will sail to out to the right side of your table or at the bottom of the net, due to the side spin/underspin impacted by the slice."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I think thinner sponge helps with smashing.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Some rubbers are better for smashing than others as well..
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Some really grip and some are less sensitive to spin.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"The outlaw is outstanding for smashing IMO, 2.0mm better than MAX.Bottoming-out makes it less sensitive to spin, which is a positive, but it also makes it harder to add a little spin to bringing it down."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"I think thinner will help, just don't go too thin."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"@ Hookshot, with the hunch that you were right, I just reviewed a few videos of some of my matches, and you were absolutely correct-my form was inconsistent on my smashes."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"I was actually swinging upward on some of them, to try to put some topspin on them."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I am going to make it a point to work on that this week at the club.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Thanks!
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"@ Tat, I actually DO hit high balls like that sometimes!"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"It was funny to read what you wrote, because I thought that I was the only one who hit such an unorthodox stroke."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,But I only do that on very high balls.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"On balls that are hit medium-high (remember, I use a Seemiller backhand), I actually sometimes push my racket straight out from my body with the blade at an angle, hitting the right side of the ball."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"It results in a ball that really curves away from a right-hander, but that shot is tough on the elbow when you try to hit it hard."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,My inability to smash well has led me to acquire a few funky sidespin strokes like this--but I'd rather smash it!
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Thanks for your input, Tat."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Having seen some of your videos, I wish I could smash like you!"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"@ Alex, thanks for the advice."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"I ordered some 1.8 Four Kings (I like rubbers that have some tackiness to them, for my serves, and to get some spin on short pushes; otherwise I would have gone with your Outlaw recommendation)."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"As my game also relies on blocking a lot and moving my opponent around with wide-angle control shots, I have also ordered some Gambler Reflectoid."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Now I know that that rubber is a different animal entirely, and that slow a rubber on my blade certainly won't make my smashes any more effective!"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"But I am also continuing to experiment with a few things besides smashing, hence the Reflectoid."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Thanks again for your advice!I am really grateful for the responses, guys!"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I'll put a good word in for you with Santa...
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,like the others said the sponge thickness doesn't really matter.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,My game is somehow similar to your game I also like to block a lot and to move the opponent around from side to side and then kill the loose return with a smash.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I have always used 2.1 or max sponge and I'm doing just fine.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,You can use a slower rubber(like Reflectoid) if you want more control but the problem is that your blocks become slower aswell which might help against people who play a looping game from mid distance but your blocks will be easier to handle for someone playing close to the table.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Thanks Jim, By doing coaching, I have built up a mental list of things to look for."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Start/finish position of a stroke is one of the main ones.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Each stroke has a ""proper"" one."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"For kills or smashes, I like to use the ""straight line"" anology to explain to students."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"It is not uncommon for students to miss high, over the table smashes, usually long."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Most of the time it is starting the stroke too low and trying to loop kill it.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"I tell them you do not need the topspin for that ball, use speed."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Picture a straight line from ball to target.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Use a ""slightly"" closed bat."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Do NOT lose yor form.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Do not just swat at it.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"get in position, keep the line in mind, stroke on the line."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,A hard kill shot like this will overcome most incomming spin.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Max sponge works just fine.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"A very good thread guys, thanks for the great ideas on approach to hitting high balls!"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"I'm going to copy and paste the advice into my ""TT methods"" file!"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Then I will re-read it to commit the methods to memory.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"I totally agree with hookshot, work on ur technique."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I also teach kids.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I feel the best way to teach them is by example.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Show them how to move in and put the ball away.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"So try to see if u have someone good hitter around u to watch his technique.I havent played Four Kings, but it sounds good, prolly better for looping then hitting?"
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I think u will loose perfomance both on smashes and especially on loops if u switch to a thinner sponge.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Id rather try another rubber instead.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"As Haggisv said, Outlaw is a good hitting rubber."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,But my guess is Four Kings is ok.Lets say u have worked on ur stroke and its good.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,If u are still having problems controlling the placement of the smashes try to close the bat even more.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Sometimes on forehand, the harder I hit, or rather the higher the ball, the more I close the bat angle to better control placement, sometimes to an extreme, but it works."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,"Hope it helps.Edit: Actually what I said about closing the angle is somewhat misleading, as I tend to grip the bat differently in those situations."
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Dont be afraid to twiddle a little to get off a really good shot.Good luck m8
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,I am always searching for a rubber that loops and flat hits equally good.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,Palio THORS is best I have tried so far for a nice mix of both.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,It has lots of gears as well which I need being a defender.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,It is more expensive than gambler but worth a try.
123,5f6c31e1220a4650ffffda33,Thin or thick sponge better fro smashing?,If you have played with tacky and grippy before you might like the fact that you get a good mix of both with this rubber.

124,5f6c31ed220a4650ffffda3d,What is the lightest Tensor or glue effect rubber?,"Yes, in general the ones with the softest sponge are the lightest."
124,5f6c31ed220a4650ffffda3d,What is the lightest Tensor or glue effect rubber?,"I guess the ones with a soft sponge also have a thin topsheet, as they may not work very well with a thick (and this heavier) topsheet."

125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,Have you guys hit the Grip-S stuff?
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,What was it like?
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,Pretty strange.
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,"Recently in the men's semi final against Ryu Seung Min in the Polish open, iTV had a close-up of Vladimir Samsonov's racket and he had some kind of rubber with a purple sponge on his forehand and backhand."
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,I think Tibhar is currently marketing the Grip-S as being used by Samsonov as well.
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,"Pretty weird then, that there is such little product control among the Grip-S product."

125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,Tibhar is supposed to launch the Grip-S Europe.
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,Maybe that's the rubber Samsonov was using; or it's a different one.

125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,I always wonder why people get all excited about sponge color.
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,I am sure they can color the sponge any way they want with a dye and it should not materially affect how the same sponge plays.
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,"I do know that often different colors denote different sponges, but they COULD be the same sponge (density, elasticity, formation, preparation, etc).While I do see how color affects the rubber, I just don't see that color (as long as its ITTF ok based on the topsheet) matters."
125,5f6c3201220a4650ffffda4c,black Grip-S: black and or purple sponge?,What am I missing?

127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Transcend SP.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"Very tacky, good control, fair speed as far as Chinese rubbers go."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Not that fast IMO.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Many thanks for your help on this.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Speed is not a driver for me as the pace is created more in my stroke rather than the rubber.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,I'm looking for maximum dwell time for spin..... which as a result should also provide the control I need as well.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"Tihbar Dang was one of my ""best of best"" ideas but the sponge is too hard so not so great for looping but fantastic for backspin."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"Its difficult to trust the catalogue ratings these days as I've tried rubbers with a ""high"" spin rating which I thought were just average."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"The rubbers from the Friedship warehouse are a good source, but I know there are others, such as Globe which are smaller brands, but have the potential to provide what I am looking for."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Take a look at DHS G666.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"Medium-hard, very tacky, tons of control, and inexpensive."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"Also, I've had 4 or 5 sheets in black and they all seem of nice quality and consistency."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"LKT Red Diamond is only slightly tacky, but offers some of the best combination of spin/speed/control for a controlled looping game."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"Plus, it's only 14 US dollars a sheet."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"It's the best chinese rubber I've ever tried so far (others were Cream Transcend, SP Transcend, Hurricane 2, Neo Hurricane 3, Black Power)."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"I never really used it for chopping, so I can't really say if it will work well in that aspect."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Butterfly Tackiness Chop is great.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,Globe 999/ 999T would be ideal I'd have thought-and cheap so not much lost if you don't like it.What about Hurricane 3/ Neo 3?-I know quite a few defenders who use it.I don't chop in matches but often play as a defender in practice (to give team mates practice)-I enjoy chopping with my Hurricane Neo 3.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,To me Hurricane Neo 3 is a controlled spin rubber.
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"definitely, this rubber i have actually tried and it is tacky, tackier than cream but cream isnt known for being tacky."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"if you clean it regularly, it will last you a long time, and its tack will sort of drop but will still be tacky."
127,5f6c3215220a4650ffffda58,High Spin / Control Rubber,"its slow, and 2.0 thickness will still bottom out due too being really soft, but that softness gives amazing control for a spinny rubber.hope this helps"
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,No reactions yet.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,so perhaps I just rephrase.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Can someone compare boost tc with hexer/baracuda?
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"TC is softer, better glue feel, less grip, less spin on slow strokes (serve/push/brush loop)."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Maybe similiar or a bit slower speedwise.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Hexer and Baracuda are Tenergy wannabes.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,So the Boost rubbers are easier to play with than Hexer?
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Perhaps I should go indeed with TC on FH and TP on BH, although I understand that TP has a very low throw, and I'm not sure if I would like that."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,I use a Stiga Boost TX on my backhand and Tenergy 64 on my forehand.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,I am VERY happy with the boost TX.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It feels firmer than the Tenergy 64.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It is almost as fast and as spinny as the 64.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It definitely has more control and more gears.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Plays very well with short pushes over the table and flat drives.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It has a softer sponge which allows u to loop well with excellent spin.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,The throw angle is a high medium.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"For me it is the perfect backhand rubber, no problems with it whatsoever."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"To be honest with you, on a scale of 1 to 10, Tenergy 64 is 9, the Boost is 8.5."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I would definitely recomment this rubber but overall tenergy seems better, but not by much."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Thanks, that's useful to know."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I don't have the time (or opportunity) to play more than twice per week, so I think I'll order some sheets of Boost once the current season is finished (only another 4 matches or so)."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Humza, your description of TX sounds interesting, I am tempted now to use this one."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Decisions, decisions...."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Bear in mind that Hexer and Baracuda are not identical.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Hexer is harder and faster and pretty much better in every way.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Not a whole lot better, but noticeably."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,(Obviously this means that some other players might prefer Baracuda.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,What this mainly means is they should not be considered exactly the samething).
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"From what I read I thought that they are virtually identical, with Baracuda only a little bit slower."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Perhaps that would make baracuda also a bit easier to play with?
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,And how does Tibhar Genius fit in this?
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,So Hexer is not very forgiving with poorly executed shots.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,How is Roxon 450 in that respect?
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I'm playing local league level, and very few people are indeed really good at the short game."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Leaning towards Roxon 450 now (but I might change my mind again....).
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,Very useful advise - many thanks.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,In the end I went with baracuda.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Nice rubber, very spinny, durability could be better."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,I decided against the boost after reading elsewhere that it is very sensitive to humidity.
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I had a hit with Baracuda today, and I really liked it."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"I think many people dismissed this rubber as some players reviewed it as being too slow, but I found it plenty fast enough, and it was very spinny."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"The sheet I tried certainly wasn't new, but I still got huge kick on my loops, so I suspect durability is not too bad either."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"Coming from mainly Chinese rubbers, I've used to having to generate my own pace instead of getting a lot from the rubber, and the speed was quite good, easily faster than many Chinese rubbers, and probably only a little slower than t05."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,"It's actually quite a bit slower than T05, but one could probably get used to it."
128,5f6c3223220a4650ffffda62,Boost tc vs Hexer/baracuda,It is quite spinny.

129,5f6c3245220a4650ffffda7a,tacky or grippy,"I usually look at tabletennisdb.com, they have numbers from players reviewing it."
129,5f6c3245220a4650ffffda7a,tacky or grippy,"I wouldnt only look at the numbers though, the written reviews seems to be more valuable then the numbers."
129,5f6c3245220a4650ffffda7a,tacky or grippy,"I think the numbers in most cases are pretty meaningless.. you simply cannot define the spin of a rubber by a single number, as it depends very much on the stroke you play."
129,5f6c3245220a4650ffffda7a,tacky or grippy,"Reviews help, but they are still nowhere near as valuable as discussions on the forum, as you get a range of opinion and consensus.In most cases, Chinese brand rubbers are tacky, and other are grippy."
129,5f6c3245220a4650ffffda7a,tacky or grippy,"There are some exceptions to it, and in recent times more Chinese rubbers are non-tacky and a few non-Chinese are tacky (but no doubt coz they Chinese made  ), but the great majoirty of Chinese rubbers are still tacky."

131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,I'm currently using juic drive smash ultima without speedgluing it.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,And I'm very satisfied.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"Grippy topsheet (easily lifts the ball), low throw, lightweight, and definitely not mushy at all!"
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"I prefer this rubber over sriver, sigma, rossa soft, jo waldner, mark V on a stiff all wood blade."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"Yes, Inspirit Quattro Ultra Light is very good, and durable, regular Insprit is good too.Didnt like regular Quattro version though."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,What is it you don't like about Sriver?
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,I think that would help us all out alot.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"I mean, how can I recommend a rubber to you if we don't get any like/dislikes?"
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"I haven't played Magna before, but I have hated every single Stiga rubber that I have hit with."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,The Magna always sounded like one of the only ones I could probably stand to play.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"what I didn't like with sriver was looping (too hard for me), harder feel, and its low throw, also I didn't like chopping with sriver either."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,this is the matter of technique.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,sriver can do it all but it is not easy to play with apart from playing against topspin balls (for which sriver is very good for)
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,Classic Mark V. Still good.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,Hi Friendship.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,I would suggest Mark V as well.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,It is probably the cheapest and highest quality Classic Rubber on the market right now.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,Great rubber.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"I have tried quite a few other rubber but none match the versatility and durability of Mark V. From my experience it is lighter, more spin than regular sriver with a slightly softer sponge (medium firm) and higher throw."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"I get mine from ilpp.tw, $22 a sheet."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,I think ttnpp also has it (max only) for $22.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"hi  it's interesting, but I never tried mark V. and certainly it is not expensive rubber."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,how is it compared with sriver fx?
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"(spin, speed, throw angle, hardness)?"
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"Mark V sponge is faster and firmer than FX, throw angle slightly higher."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,"Sriver L, EL, FX has the same topsheet."
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,FX may be a bit lighter.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,I find Mark V to have more spin and a better allround rubber.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,You cant go wrong with it.
131,5f6c3255220a4650ffffda85,Good classic rubber w/o speedglue?,Plenty of reviews over at at http://www.tabletennis.gr
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,"I used to play Stiga Synchro both wings, but that's a long time ago.It was a spinny, fast rubber."
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,Softish topsheet on a mediumhard sponge.
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,"Sponges were different on the red and black sheet to compensate for the difference in hardness of the red and black topsheet, hence the name Synchro.A good replacement for Mark V at the time."
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,If your friend wants something alike i'd suggest the Donic JOW or Mark V XS.
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,Thanks XenoNL!
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,"He's ordered a sheet of Mark V XS, hope it brings him back to his old level."
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,"One more question, does the Mark V XS have a high throw?"
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,I've always considered Mark V to be medium throw.
132,5f6c325b220a4650ffffda8a,Synchro / syngro?,"As I remember it, the XS version has a slighly higher throw than the regular Mark V but not alot, and bit more catapult."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,I find Speedplay's color-coded review always an interesting read.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Well done!
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Wow great review speedplay!
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Comparing 2 rubbers like that is very useful.I'm still a little surprised how quickly you learned to love the T05.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,comsidering your initial thoughts...
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,This is probably also the first rubber that you and I BOTH liked
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Really good job Speedplay.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Very comprehensive and well thought out review.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,You analyse the two rubbers and then explain them so nicely that it makes if easy for us to figure out the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two rubbers.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,It really seems as if T05 is the rubber of choice for a player who wants to be in control of the point and has full faith in his abilities.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,What I mean to say is Tenergy 05 is not for the faint of heart.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Many would bs asking the question.

133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"Speedplay, I am very happy with the way you explained how controllable the T05 is."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"I tried to tell a lot of people that though it is one of those 'fast' and 'powerful' rubber, it has very good control and people would look at me as if I am nut."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"Of course, I do not have the ability to explain like you did so I don't blame them for thinking I am talking nonsense."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"So much so that I actually thought I am nut   Thanks for giving me back my sanity  And yes, a very good comprehensive review"
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Pretty accurate description of T05
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Really good point...
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,I'm sure you right... and this is also a good reason to test any peice of equipment over multiple sessions...
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,I'm sure I'm guilty of jumping to conclusions after a single session as well.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Sounds like a good topic for another thread actually

133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,You see them the first hour and grow to like them more the first week.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Nice review.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,It seems like I've come back just at the right time.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,I remember your Roxon 450 review quite clearly and one thing that really made me wonder was your comment on the Roxon's spin.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"As far as I experienced Tensors, they never produced so much spin to make me jump for joy (which T05 actually did  )."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"But now that I've got a reference to the Tenergy, this question should be solved."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,the whole is discussing about tenergy being the spinniest or not should stop really.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"I don't see a difference in the spin of my loop when I use Tenergy 25 or Sriver FX, that's because my technique is not good enough."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"If you have a good technique you will probably get the best out of tenergy but even then,when you're technique is good you can create heavy spin loops with every rubber."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,You can't expect to let the rubber to do the job for you it's about technique.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"@Speedplay: Well, opening loops seemed pretty spinny to me."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"In my opinion T05 excels in looping against backspin due to the high throw, its density (pretty soft, yes, kill me for that  ) and high grip."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"But that's up to personal preferences, nothing to argue about."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"@sunflex: Tenergy is definitely not the spinniest rubber there is, I can get (or at least ist feels like this) more spin with my tacky chinese rubbers."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,But this is again up to personal preference.And letting the rubber do the player's job is something that only works for basement players (who shouldn't run around with a Tenergy imo).
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Exactly my point.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,That's why I still prefer a classic rubber like Sriver.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,The bounciness just makes it impossible to have a good control over a shot.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"Ofcourse it can be done, but it's easier with Sriver, and that's not just because it isn't glued!"
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"I agree with Speedplay, for me T05 is not much more durable than some tensors."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"It doesn't crumble around the edges (much) but the topsheet loses grip after some time that for me is not that much more than I used to get with tensors when I used them.But I have had many sheets of T05 and they have all been very good, don't know what happened to speedplay."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"Correct me if I'm wrong here Speedplay, but you have at least one more sheet of T05 waiting in the wings correct?"
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"If so, have you tried opening it to see what it is like?"
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"If its like your first sheet, seal up the one you don't like and use it for now."
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Leave the sealed up sheet alone until you are in desperate need of it.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,Maybe between now and then you will find a cheaper alternative.
133,5f6c3262220a4650ffffda8d,Tenergy 05 review/compared to Roxon 450.,"If the last sheet is the same as the second one, well you know the first one was just good luck (or bad luck depending on how you see it)."
134,5f6c32a0220a4650ffffdab3,Best rubbers for counter hitter/blocker?,"i think many short pips rubbers do that job very well, if you like inverted then in my opinion it would be outlaw, very good rubber."
135,5f6c32b8220a4650ffffdac2,"TC Boost, Magna TS 11 or roxon 450","Personally, i wouldn't change, i used r450 and found that it was very nice.I think when stiga was making the boost series, they over exaggerated the speed, and i actually found that TC had terrible spin compared to the newer andro rubbers.As for the magna, i've never used it b4."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,I'm currently using the Donic Coppa Jo Silver with a Kong Linghui Special Blade.Usually I play with a Xu Shaofa 999 and a Bryce Speed... so this is softer option for me.The Donic Coppa is very nice to play and give strong feedback in the hand.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,The arylate carbon blade is a very good combination.The power is present mostly on mid-distance and the rubber is very soft and better for looping play vs hitting stroke.The throw is medium and the overall feeling is European.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"My serve are less spinny, but I need less physical involvement to give dead shot."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,It's more easy for me on FH cause the rubber is more insensitive to the opponent spin.The curve on my FH is less disturbing compare with the 999 but the speed is higher with a lovely nice sound.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"You can do everything you want with this rubber, I think to keep it on my BH and I will give a try with the Gold version (harder sponge and feel I think)."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"My dream should be to have the 999 with such play-feel.Last but not l the least the new incoming Donic formula series (S1, Acuda...) make the price decrease for this very good tensor rubber => around 25€ (in Paris).A drawback can be durability around 1.5 month with 6 hours per week.The Bryce speed fx is more durable on this matter.Hope it's help.Brahms"
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,Thank you very much.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,That was very helpful.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,I think I will order some now!
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"I used to use JO Silver.I think it's claimed 40 deg, but it probably feels softer as the topsheet is softer compared to other similar tensors."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,Very grippy topsheet - however does not last that long.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,More fragile than newer ones too.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"It's a very corky/springy rubber and quite fast, given how soft it is and relative to other tensors in this hardness category.."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,I finally tried the JO Coppa Gold on my FH.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,(Butterfly KLS blade)The rubber is harder and give more speed on flat strokes... but beware... very less forgiving.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"The topsheet is the same than the silver, sponge is harder.If you are really regular this rubber may be nice for you.My coach thinks this rubber is slow... but don't worry this my coach."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,I prefer the Silver overall but this my thought...
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,I keep you in touchBrahms
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"Thanks, keep me posted with any updates."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,The JO Coppa Gold is very difficult to master.More speed but less spin compare with the Silver.I use it on my BH now cause to hard for me to play with on FH.The sound is also less loudy compare with the Silver.Platin soft should be another option for my FH I guess !!!!!!!!!

136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,"From the three, I prefer Coppa Gold."
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,I think it is less bouncy compared to Silver and Platin.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,Donic have brought out a new one called Coppa X3 Silver.
136,5f6c32bf220a4650ffffdac7,Anyone use or try Donic Coppa Jo Silver?,It also has a soft sponge and they claim it will last 50% longer.

137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"T64 is supposed to be softest and fastest of the bunch, but less spinny than T05."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,I've only used T05 and T25.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"I'm guessing if you like fast blocking/countering close to table mixed with long distance loops, T64 might be for you.I personally found that pairing T05 with flexible looping blades does not work well for pushes."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Too bouncy for my taste.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Much better paired with stiffer blades.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Or try one of the tensors other people rave about.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Dawei IQUL seems to have a loyal following.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Same for Palio Macro ERA/Blitz.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,One of these days I'll probably buy a sheet of both just out of curiosity.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,i'm using T05 and bryce speedwhen i put the T05 on my BH - the block and loops are awsome!!!
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,pushes not so goodbut when i put the bryce speen on the BH (MUCH lower throw angle then T05) - the pushes and slicks are great but if i go one step back - the low-throw angle rubbers are nightmare.. also really hard to lift backspin with the bryce speed (or any other low throw angle rubber)i found the T05 to be the best BH rubber i ever tried (i tried only 9 rubbers but still...)
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,thanks pushchop.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,You guessed right.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,That is actually what my game consists of.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,I was actually between T25 or T64.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Recently though i found out that T64 feels like a supercharged Sriver EL.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Ive read enough reviews about SriverEL to probably give it a try.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,I would like to try the T64 for my BH but the price is a little much.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,For now i purchased IQUL SV and give that a try.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Thanks for the replies guys.BTW T05 seems too high of a throw for the BH
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Tell us how you like it.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"IQUL 40 deg was too soft for me, so is Vega Pro, so I like harder rubber."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"IQUL40 should be more controllable than tenergy.I thought T64 would be harder than IQUL 40 deg, though."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"There's a few versions floating around of the QUL 40 deg, some much harder than others..."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,i was actually contemplating whether i should have gotten the SV(35) or the Regular(40).
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,I hope it is at least faster and quicker than the regular inspirit SV.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Tenergy does have a firmer sponge but according to many it is the softest of the tenergy line (before FX) and that it plays quite soft but feels firm (lol)
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"PRO HAMMOND BETA, PRO HAMMOND BETA, PRO HAMMOND BETA D Or you could go for Palio Macro Era, Blit'z or Donic Barracuda."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Blit'z and Barracuda are both pretty insensitive to spin in my opinion.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Andro Plasma 430.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Would you guys recommend the DHS Neo Line-up as a bh rubber?
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Specifically the H3 or the H2 Neo?I am actually considering to try the DHS Memo 2 but still unsure.The IQUL SV has alot of control but i dont have the confidence to attack due to the rubber bottoming out most of the time.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Planning to upgrade to a harder sponge instead of the usual 35 degrees for me.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"no, not really, but some people like Chinese rubbers on the backhand."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"""if i go one step back - the low-throw angle rubbers are nightmare""  i'm sure many would disagree.."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,My game is mainly close to the table.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,I am a FH dominant player and use my BH for placement for my FH.Recently i want to attack more thus my search for a new BH rubber.The thin topsheet of the iqul also made my loops less successful since i have to really dig in to get it pass the net.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,THanks guys!
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Hi mon22I think we have similiar playing styles.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Im also searching for a good backhand rubber with good control for push and speed for smash.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"I personally would not recommend tacky rubbers for backhand, but I know others like it.Quattro UL 40 has very good control, and sponge is not terribly hard."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Its also very good for looping.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"Speedwise though, its not a monster, smashes are far from perfect."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Im trying the Gambler Outlaw at the moment and I seem to really like it.
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"Better speed than Quattro, but less control."
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,"U could also try the Joola Tango extreme (tensor) for a really offensive bh rubber, but I doubt u would like the control of that one, works very well close to the table though, but not good for pushes.Or as pushchop recommended, why not try the Palio Blitz?"
137,5f6c32c8220a4650ffffdacd,Help w/ BH rubber,Ive heard much good things about it.Good luck m8
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,Everybody has different reasons.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"Some people even like tacky rubber on the BH.For me, tacky is not suited to BH."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,BH is not as powerful as FH and is a shorter stroke.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,A tacky rubber would be too slow.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,They require longer strokes to access their power and overcome tack.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"Yes, blocking is also more sensitive to spin and much slower."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"People would just play into my backhand, unafraid of their own power being returned to them."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"Whereas with FH, I'm always ready to execute a powerful stroke."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,i agree w/ 82's.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,it all depends on your strokes.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"Take the chinese for example, the top players seem to favor a european/japanese based rubber on their bhs as it is convenient at their level of play."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"But the dhs rubber you mentioned may be a good bh, but it all depends on preference."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"Besides, majority of the times the Bh is used to control the game and set shots up for your fh, which is difficult (to some people) w/ tacky rubbers.as for myself, i prefer the tacky rubber (dhs g888) on my bh when attacking and slamming on my bh, but i am more consistent by controlling the game using the dawei inspirit (nontacky) for my bh."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,hoped i helped
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,There are some pros that do use tacky on both sides... their is a female player from Singapore who's name is not coming to mind who does.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,Most Chinese players do not however.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,I think it has to do with the fact that there is more wrist in the backhand movement that can generate more spin but not as much speed.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,Euro style rubbers can make up for this.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,Of course if you are powerful enough it may not matter.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,Actually I'm of the opinion that most bhs are a driving action with more solid contact than what a sticky rubber really requires.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"So most use a bh rubber that suits this action, which are non-sticky rubbers (ie, better normal force perpendicular to the rubber, whereas most sticky rubbers have better tangential)"
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,tnt is a decent rubber.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,not tacky but still spinny.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,it's sriver-esque.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,might be a bit slow ( but not SLOW) without tuning.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,should be good for backhand.
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,"I tried it on forehand with speedglue a long time ago, and thought it wasn't tacky enough."
138,5f6c32e3220a4650ffffdadd,why not tacky on BH/ DHS TNT,It had power though!

139,5f6c32e5220a4650ffffdade,How do you clean a Chinese / tacky inverted rubber properly?,Spinmax is brilliant
139,5f6c32e5220a4650ffffdade,How do you clean a Chinese / tacky inverted rubber properly?,+1 spinmax
139,5f6c32e5220a4650ffffdade,How do you clean a Chinese / tacky inverted rubber properly?,"Second this, with the slight difference of making sure the rubbers are still damp (not wet) when you put the protectors on."
139,5f6c32e5220a4650ffffdade,How do you clean a Chinese / tacky inverted rubber properly?,"Also found that sticky protectors work better than non-sticky, they seem to rejuvenate the rubber.I've used spinmax once or twice but am not really happy to use chemicals."

140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,And the throw angle.
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"Sorry, haven't had time to write the review yet.Sponge hardness (with reference to my table):JUIC Air Condle 36JUIC Air Condle Speed 39JUIC Air Condle Sound 33Platin (38deg) and Platin Soft (34) are in the tabl;e as well, although I have not had a sheet of Vega to measure as yet.Throw of the Sound is around medium, speed a little lower, but both increase in throw when you powerloop."
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"Both rubbers are fast, but the 'Speed' has a very high topspeed."
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"Wow, Platin is 38.Anyway, that's good news about the hardness."
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,I might give it a try.
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Any news about these rubbers?
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"I'm curious about their performance compared to Cornilleau rubbers (same hardness, 33° and 39°).Thanks"
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"Sorry I keep meaning to update, but other things I need to test always seem to get into the way.I glued both the Speed and Sound MAX onto a Cornilleau hinotec blade (fairly fast carbon but has some flex) and had a brief hit;The Sound version I liked better than the Regular Air Condle... the softer sponge made it easier to dig the ball in, so loops were spinnier and with more feel... a very nice looping rubber.The Speed version was REALLY fast..."
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,I had major trouble keeping the ball on the table...the speed of the sponge seemed to just carry it miles too far with not really that much spin either.
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"I can't help but wonder if it happened to be a really bad combination with the blade I used, but I have not yet got around to trying it another blade."
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,A blade with a real low throw might be required to compensate for the appearant very high throw on fast loops.... or else I simply could not adjust my strokes to this rubber...The topsheets feels really grippy (almost tacky) but a little firm.
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"This is why I think the spin on serves/pushes is pretty decent, but on faster loops it just flies off."

140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,I want to try Air Condle Speed.
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,I'm wondering if I should pair it with Acuda S1 or 999 Turbo.
140,5f6c3304220a4650ffffdaef,Review: JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Or perhaps give ACS a miss altogether.

141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,I play CPen.I would probably play the same if both sides are the same (right) rubber.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"1) If you are talking competition, most have a carbon blade, (Yinhe, $15), H-3 forhand or pen and a euro on the backhand for shake players."

141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,And the reason I say it is because I play traditional penhold.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"I always choose the best rubber for my forehand, and then use it on my backhand as well, by making certain adjustments, and by moving to make sure I use my forehand as much as possible."

141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,I actually really like flextra.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,It's quite grippy and lasts a bloody long time.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,A 6 month old flextra is grippier than a 6 month old sriver.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,I am judging from the only tourney I played in.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,It was an inter-provincial tourney.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,Our best coach won and was a shakehands player.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"Our third best coach, uses C-Pen and RPB."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,Even over the table he can flip short balls using RPB that most people would have pushed and make super spinny shots.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,He uses tons of wrist on these shots.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"They are like a short, super spinny loop."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,Might even double bounce.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,Very hard to keep the return low.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"He uses this a lot on short, chop serves to his backhand.I think shakehands is going to take over C-Pen."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"They tell me not long ago, there were very few shake players, although, RPB may change that in favor of C-Pen again."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,Thanks for all the info.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"hookshot.I will be in China in 10 days, but probably not enough time to do much TT things there, except for watching some TT on TV and look at some TT stuffs in the shops.First time I watched MLin or WLQ played was a match between them on TV when I visited China."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,My reaction was: Wow!
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"(Again, sorry for going off topic.)"
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,When I played a city tournament in my wife's hometown in China it was about 25% shakehand at most.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,This tournament included amateur and former professional players.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,Level ranged from about 2000 to 2500.
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"The lower end of that range included some really strange penhold styles, many of the shakehand players were at the higher end."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"Later, I spent some time at a provincial training center in Wuhan."
141,5f6c330f220a4650ffffdaf5,Same inverted rubbers on both sides or not,"Much better players, professionals at a young age, definitely more than half shakehand."
142,5f6c3316220a4650ffffdafa,which rubber? T25 or bryce speed?,Bryce Speed is a very good bh rubber.This is a low throw rubber... so nice for close-play.Brahms
142,5f6c3316220a4650ffffdafa,which rubber? T25 or bryce speed?,"yes, but T25 is also a low-throw rubberthey are the same in that aspect"
142,5f6c3316220a4650ffffdafa,which rubber? T25 or bryce speed?,"Bryce Speed is relatively less reactive to spin, so it's rather great for close-table, where the spin on the ball is still very strong."
142,5f6c3316220a4650ffffdafa,which rubber? T25 or bryce speed?,"A fat balsa blade can give you huge speed close to the table, even with a cheap Chinese rubber... if you insist on one of those 2 rubbers, I'd go for the Bryce as well, due to much less sensitivity to spin."
142,5f6c3316220a4650ffffdafa,which rubber? T25 or bryce speed?,bryce speed it is =]thx everyone!
143,5f6c3322220a4650ffffdb02,Yasaka Pryde 30/40 vs Yasaka Mark V,welcome to the forum!i cannot tel u about the yasaka rubbers but can say that most modern defeners like harder sponges as these give a bit more speed which is needed from far back from the table.
143,5f6c3322220a4650ffffdb02,Yasaka Pryde 30/40 vs Yasaka Mark V,also harder sponges generally have more gears.
143,5f6c3322220a4650ffffdb02,Yasaka Pryde 30/40 vs Yasaka Mark V,having said that i prefer soft sponges(30-35)
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,i ordered 'em.
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,Will post impressions in a few days.
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,BBC Table Tennis just ordered CCT National Pride / National Strike / Pogo OX LP so I'll likely get a chance to try them once Charlie gets them on a batch of demo blades he's currently assembling.
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,Also has Red Diamond / Black Power en route in the same order.
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,Anyone?
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,Charlie and I tested a big batch of rubber from Zeropong that weekend including the ones mentioned above.
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,"Overall, none of the inverteds were all that impressive, and none came close to Gambler Outlaw."
144,5f6c3327220a4650ffffdb04,CCT National Pride / National Strike,The surprise of the evening was CTT Pogo LP as described in the Pogo thread now underway here on OOAK.
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,I found the Bryce line of rubber to be excellent in this particular usage.
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"I haven't personally tried the Express 1 or 2, so I can't vouch for them."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"I used Joola Express 1 last season, and it was the fastest rubber around at the time."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Very flat throw, with a low spin level make it the opposite of Tenergy."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Great for hitting at the table, excellent for pushing (seems to grip well on slow shots), consistent smashes."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"The downside is the low spin, which makes it hard work for loopers, but for blockers (you have to be good to control it though) and hitters it's excellent."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,Pretty hard sponge lacks feel (on an Andro Super Core Off+) but gives a positive air to the rubber - it's getting the ball back rather than sinking in.
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"If you're comparing it to Bryce Speed FX then Express 2 is the similar rubber (softer sponge), which will add some spin and feel at the expense of pace."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"I'm probably changing to Bryce Speed in the close season (May) unless the new toys they bring out look more fun.Also worth considering Andro Hexer - a loss of speed to the 2 above, but very accurate and quite spinny (can lift pushes easily) and plentry of gears."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Plays well attacing over the table with all-out top-spin hits, but durability can be an issue if you play more than 10 hours a week."
145,5f6c3329220a4650ffffdb06,Joola Express 1/2 VS Bryce Speed FX,"Great post, welcome to the forum ScousePaul!"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,That is a beautiful sheet of rubber!
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Is it a euro style topsheet?
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It would be made in the Haifu Factory, but you're right the topsheet looks very good... obviously a high quality mold!"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"ditto, nice art design, and the calligraphy strokes for ""海夫"" are just brilliant compared to ""狂飆"" on the DHS Neo Hurricane series.There is much room for improvement on the QC side of things."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Guess they have yet to find a way to get the tuned sponge dry enough before attaching the topsheet, which is very likely the root of all these undesired ""pregnancies""."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,WOW looks like a very high quality rubber.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The bubble is a bad sign though, I hope durability it's better than Outlaw's.BTW I have seen this rubber at european retailers but it's very rare among non european retailers."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I'm glad somebody will finally review this rubber.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,so where stays the review?
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I'm kinda curious about this rubber.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Good question, I'll ask him  Last time I spoke to him he loved it, the clostest to a real glued up rubber he said... and he's tried a LOT!"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Finally my review is here sorry for the delay but my initial excitment waned.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"As a new season is about to start, I decided to change my old Tenergy 05 both sides which I had been using to coach my students to a softer and faster BH rubber."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I am a two wing looper who loves massive spin and speed produced from physical power and a grippy but not tacky top sheet.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,As many would agree there are few faults with Tenergy but as I use an all wood 4-ply blade I was wanting a softer sponge to allow more feeling on my BH loop.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,This is very important when having fun while playing against people like Haggisv who with his evil pimples I need all the feeling I can get LOL.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I have tried many of the latest glue effect rubbers from different companies and always felt none came close to the feeling of how I use to play with a glued up rubber.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Then Haggisv lent me a new carbon blade and rubber from this French company whom I have never heard of and I really didn't like their rubber.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It was all speed, little spin or control, but on the BH side was Haifu's Shark 2 tuned and I really liked it!"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It was so light and soft but had amazing power with a grippy Japanese type top sheet.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I went online shopping and came across Shark 3 and thought hmmm why not go for the top of the line it must be better than 2 because it had a 3 on the packaging LOL.Ok, enough background, lets get to the review."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Physical properties:Shark 3 is written on the package but on the rubber is Shark Speed, strange to have 2 names for one rubber but it comes in a vacuum packaging the same as Haifu's other tuned rubber like Blue Whale 2 and Shark 2."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I really was not expecting Shark 3 to be so DIFFERENT from Shark 2.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,When I tested the Shark 2 from Haggisv it used a light super soft yellow sponge but on Shark 3 it has a heavy dense pink sponge.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I included the pictures of the weights of my uncut Tenergy to compare the uncut Shark 3.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,There is a layer of glue on the back of the pink sponge but it is a lot thinner than the thick layer on my old Blue Whale 2.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Some people remove this layer to save weight but I think this layer adds to the bounce and feel of the rubber.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The rubber has quite a good dome straight from the package, while the sponge being an unusual dark pink colour is quite dense and heavy, but is actually quite soft, nothing like any other Chinese rubber I have used."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Haifu mark this sponge as 34 degrees with their laser type etching on the bottom.This is the first rubber I have ever bought or heard of that has the degrees and thickness hand written on the sponge!
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The factory workers in China must have hand cramps if they mark every sponge personally.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The sponge has a strong chemical smell but in a nice way, almost fruity."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The top sheet is where this rubber stands out for me.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is so beautiful to look at almost translucent with the Chinese characters looking amazing.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,This sheet is similar to a Japanese Bryce in its looks but feels very Chinese in its texture.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is not tacky at all and can not pick up a ball from the table.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The sheet is extremely grippy just like Tenergy but in a more synthetic way.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Speed :For the grip this rubber has it has amazing speed Compared to my Tenergy on the same stroke and power it is about 20% faster.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I would not class it as a speed demon but 20% faster than Tenergy is still quite fast.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"For this amount of speed you get massive spin as well, unlike other speed only rubbers."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is more springy than Tenergy but in a wonderful glue feel way.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I can feel the ball bite into the rubber and it feels like it stays there for a split moment then catapults out like my old speed glue rubbers.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"This feeling I have found missing in all my other glue effect rubbers, so I am thrilled that this Shark3 has this feeling as well as a HUGE click sound."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is louder than any rubber I have tried without speed glue and even louder than my Donic F3 Big Slam which only gets its super loud click from a ridiculously super soft sponge.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Unlike the Big Slam and other soft sponge rubbers which bottom out so easily this Shark3 keeps on spinning and keeping control even with very strong power loops.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,However it does have its limits for a soft sponge so I agree with the recommendation from Haifu that this rubber suits a BH and not a FH if you loop really hard.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Spin: I see and feel very little difference in the spin generated from Shark 3 compared to my Tenergy.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Tenergy still has more but the effect on your oponent during the game is very similer.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,On serves it can do all the serves I can do with Tenergy but with far more control.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Short backspin serves can be done where the ball rolls back to the net after 3 or 4 bounces so plenty of spin.On my BH I can loop backspin more easily than I could with the Tenergy as the ball sinks into the sponge more and gives me more feeling.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Even though this rubber does have a lower throw than Tenergy it is not a big difference so I did not have to make too many changes to my technique.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Control :Here again this rubber so surprised me on my punch blocks.The ball just catapults off with a loud crack and goes wherever I wanted it to go.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I am not fighting with this rubber for control like other speed rubbers but feel it is working with me to put the ball in the right place.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The same goes for loops.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I would say it has 70% of the control I get from Tenergy which is really good as I find Tenergy to be one of the best control rubbers out there.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,On pushes this rubber is more springy but still retains it's control.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I will need to practice more to get my short pushes as short as I could with Tenergy but I think with a few more weeks of practice I will.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Other playing properties and comments :Put simply this rubber is a BEAST, period."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,If this rubber was put on a hard and fast 5-ply carbon blade then it would be a very formidable combination with huge possibilities of getting quite close to reliving the feeling of playing with a speed glued rubber.Besides the positives I have mentioned above there are a few negatives as well.The first negative is the price.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,For me it cost $15AUD less than my Tenergy!
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Granted it is not as expensive as the crazy priced $90+USD Whale 3 but asking close to a Tenergy price for a Chinese rubber is a pretty tough ask.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,My last Blue Whale 2 tuned lasted me about 2 days of training before a huge bubble appeared in the center.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Now I don't mind paying the premium price asked for Tenergy or any other Japanese rubber I have used as every single sheet I have ever bought has been flawless, never split or bubbled and lasted me far longer than the cheaper priced but soo short grip life of the bouncy ESN rubbers."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"So I gave the Chinese a second chance, thinking if they are charging close to a Japanese price for their top of the line rubber then they must be very proud and stand by their quality product."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Alas this brings me to my second negative, the durability."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,My flawless new sheet lasted 15 minutes before a bubble appeared.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Then after almost 30 minutes of hitting, small splits started to appear around the bubble."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The top sheet is as fragile as glass.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Even when cutting the rubber around my blade pieces just chipped off.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"When I stretched the off cut piece just a little, the top sheet splits instantly."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I could even peel the top sheet off easily from the sponge with little effort which is never a good sign, but with the Tenergy I can stretch an off cut and the sponge will tear long before the top sheet."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,This means either Haifu have tuned this rubber to an inch of its life and my loops are to much for the glue bonds to hold or they still have very poor quality control and are just trying to rip off Western buyers by charging massivly above the genuine and accurate price they charge within their own country.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It becomes a gamble if you get a good one or a bubbler like mine.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Now come on Haifu, this is no way to build brand loyality."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,If I wanted to waste $40USD I could think of much more fun ways to do it.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"If a customer buys their top premium rubber and it lasts 15mins, will they be so impressed and go and order another one."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I don't think so.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"To sum up, I really loved this new Haifu Shark 3."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It's the best BH rubber of the new glue effect generation of rubbers I have ever tried.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The top sheet looks beautiful, plays 80% like a speed glued sheet with an amazing and very loud click sound."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It has the spin and control very close to Tenergy and smells great but alas my love affair with the Shark 3 lasted 15 minutes as did my rubber.Besides being dissapointed wasting my money I am also angry with this rubber as it had so much potential to show Japan and Germany that China can make a quality rubber that can feel like a speed glue sheet instead of just claiming that it does on the packet like other companies do.When this sheet falls apart would I buy another, the answer is no."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I do not want to spend my money and after ever loop have an anxiety attack as I look on my sheet to see if it has bubbled or torn.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I always tried to give the benefit of the doubt to Chinese companies.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I would try one of their improved and ""latest"" rubbers from time to time hoping I would be happy with my purchase."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,So far I have not had much success.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"For my latest costly failure of a purchase, I believe until the Chinese realise quantity over quality is the wrong way to produce products, they will have no loyalty from customers who will simply spend their money with companies who make quality products and take pride in what they sell."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Fantastic review, thanks SubarashiOnizuka!SubarashiOnizuka showed me his rubber and the off-cut tonight, and it is indeed quite fragile and does not stretch far before it rips."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"We measured the sponge, and it came out at 38deg on my scale, which is very nice and not likely to bottom out too quickly.I also hope this was a bad sheet and that most are a lot better, but Haifu do have to get their act together and sort out these issues as they are not restricted to just this rubber, but some of their earlier ones as well."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,What is the ITTF number on the sheet you reviewed?
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,SubarashiOnizuka:- Can you please let me know where you bought it from?
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It does not look like the ITTF approved Shark 3.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It is probably the Shark 2 topsheet with the sponge meant for Shark 3.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The new one has Made in China written on it.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,You can check the logo on ITTF website.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I guess the only place selling it right now is www.timtts.be/shop.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,So i guess yours must have come from there itself.Shark 2 was really a very very impressive rubber for its price.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"my guess is that this rubber has been super tuned by the factory same as gambler outlaw maybe similar to haggisv super priming but with boosters without vocs, which brings the topsheet under extreme tension making it with very brittle and easy to bubble."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"The topsheet has the word 'speed' on there, which i don't think the Shark 2 had.Yes i think he did get it from that shop...he can confirm..."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I think the word ""speed"" was there on Shark 2 as well."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,All I am saying here is that the Shark 3 logo is a bit different from that shown in the pics here!Check out the Shark 3 logo here:-http://www.ittf.com/ittf_equipment/Rack ... &textile=&Can someone please confirm the ITTF number on the pics?
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I cannot see it clearly!
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I have Shark II (tuned) 2.2 purchased from a reliable supplier and it is marked ""Speed"" with ITTF #90-002."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,My current sheet (red) has a cream/yellowish colored sponge marked as 35 degrees.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I have an unopened red sheet marked as 36deg.http://www.ittf.com/ittf_equipment/Rack ... &textile=&So far no problems.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It didn't seem particularly fragile, though because it is tuned I did take care to not trim too close to the blade edge to allow for eventual shrinkage."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"It seems to me that when I try to trim any rubber too close to the edge or try to ""clean up"" ragged spots is when I get pieces chipping out."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,yes I also found the Shark II to be quite durable...
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Shark II: Made in China is under Haifu nameShark III: Made in China is under Shark name
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,And the ITTF numbers are different.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Sure, but as I couldn't see the number clearly at reviwer's pics I didn't mention it."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Gotcha...so based on the photos seems the reviewer has Shark II.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,At least the topsheet seems to be from Shark II.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Thanks guys for your interest in my review of my shark 3.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,My dissapointment and anger with Haifu just increased a million times from the information some helpful members on this forum provided.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,It now seems I actually have a shark 2 topsheet on a shark 3 sponge in a new shark 3 vacuum package!
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,The ITTF code on my sheet is 90-002 which matches the ITTF code for an approved shark 2 topsheet.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Yes, I bought my ""shark 3"" from timtts.be as OOAK did not have them in stock yet."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Besides some shipping and communication problems with timtt.be I believed his stock to be genuine from the favourable reviews he has on some forums......does the evidence now indicate I was sold a fake?
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Is this why he is the only one selling the ""new"" shark 3 online."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I hope some members from this forum could help me to determine what rubber i actually bought and if it is genuine why would Haifu deceive its customers by selling the ""new shark 3 best of the best blah blah"" with a standard shark 2 topsheet."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Before we jump to conclusions, does anyone remember what the numbers are actually meant to indicate?"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"There is only one Shark topsheet on the ITTF LARC, so it's quite possible that Shark II and III have identical topsheets (apart from the numbers), and that only the sponge differs..."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I've just checked the latest ITTF LARC list (31), and the Shark II is listed as 002, and the Shark III and 006, so as correctly pointed out earlier, this rubber is not Shark III, it is Shark II with Shark III packaging.Very weird really... the packaging does look exactly like Haifu's and clearly stated Shark III."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Can't image this being a fake... but I suppose it's possible...I had a hit with the rubber today, and it does indeed play beautifully, the closest to a glued up rubber so far, and not just for looping but in the short game too (although still a little bouncy)... and this is about 5 weeks old now..."
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"Haggisv, Where did you buy the Shark III?"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,I am really interested in testing this rubber that seems to be better than the BWII which I loved except for the too-short durability of the tunning.
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"I didn't buy it, I played with SubarashiOnizuka's at our club  I'm not sure if you'd want to buy it from the same place he bought it for though, now that is seems the topsheet is NOT shark III"
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,Yeah I would not....
146,5f6c3335220a4650ffffdb0b,Haifu Shark III / Shark Speed Review,"In any case, it is not available at the shop he got it from."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Actually this was the first thing i noticed in your photos.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"Maybe i'm really out of touch, but i think having a dome is very unusual."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Is the dome still there if the protective sheets are removed?
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"It's possible that it's the plastic holding the rubber in that shape, but if it's like that without the protective sheets then that's new to me.Most rubber sold today is assembled either flat or with a reverse dome, giving a slight tension on the sponge and a corresponding compression on the topsheet."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"I did not remove the plastic sheets until after I glued it onto the blade, but I'd say that the plastic was probably holding it... the sheets felt quite supple."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"JUIC and TSP sheets often look like this too, so it did not seem unusual to me..."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,I'll confirm on the sheet sheet I cut...
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,where do the manufacture these rubbers?...
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"In Japan, AFAIK, despite Cornilleau being French."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"Thanks Alex.Excellent review.Those rubbers have been around here for quite some time, but people seem to be reluctant to try them, including my self, eventhough when they came the price was way lower(in Decathlon)"
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"I've tried the Advance ( on the Taipan ) in 2,0mm and felt not very comfortable with the low throw angle.I've cancelled the test in early stage as I think that this rubber really need to have a hard wood underneath.... and for the moment I'm not willing to change the wood."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"After a month with Ma Wenge Carbon + Pilot Power both sides, I'm pretty satisfied with these rubbers.Among all soft rubbers I tried before, Pilot Power is the fastest one."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"They still look like new and spinny.I'm still waiting for some Pilot Advance to test, as I said before on my review (other thread) but I think I'm gonna stay with this combo for next season.Ps: I'm not EJ."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Played for 3 yrs with P700 and after glue ban with T05.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,My old blade broke and I was trying to find some blade to use with softer rubbers.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,I glued a Power Red Max to my Korbel today.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"Reading the comments here, I hoped for a grippier Boost TC, which would be amazing for me."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"But no, Power is significantly less grippy than both 2 TCs I have."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"I didn't play with it yet, just bounced the ball on it."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Lower throw.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Sponge is softer.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Less bouncy.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Hope my opinion changes after I play.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,"This rubber is just like a bit lower throw Boost TS, faster though."
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,I'm suprised that they are as similiar as this.
147,5f6c3363220a4650ffffdb2c,Review: Cornilleau Pilot Advance / Pilot Power,Probably coming from the same factory.Again back to waiting for the new Magna TC and TS II.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Your current setup is fast blade + slow but firm rubber.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),This isn't a good combination for looping.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"The rubbers lack power and the blade + firm sponges require perfect timing, causing the crashes into the net."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Firm sponges need to go with slower, softer blades."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Avoid Tenergy and Tensors.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Setup 1: Avalox BT550 (or similar soft, flexible allround blade, like Dawei Genote A+) + Gambler Wraith or IQUL 42 Deg."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Max sponge.Setup 2: Your current blade + IQUL 40 deg.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You will need to develop your technique to produce your own power.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You will find IQUL / Wraith more powerful than Geospin.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),The extra dwell of the softer sponge or slow blade should stop the crashing into the net most of the time and give you enough dwell time to put in your own power.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Either of those setups should get you over 2000 USATT.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"I could beat the majority of A Reserve players with either of those setups.I suggest investing money into coaching, at least once a week for a month."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),That will make the biggest difference.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I would reccomend that you keep the blade you have and move up to a faster rubber.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),The best kind of speed is the speed we generate ourselves because that gives us more control over the game.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),IQUL in 40 degrees is a good looping rubber and not crazy fast.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),It starts off tacky but then the tackiness wears off and it plays like a Euro rubber.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),The 42 degree version is decidedly faster but it may not pair as well with your stiffer blade.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"The harder version is however better for the short game, pushing, blocking and is better at handling incoming serves."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),The rubber is cheap enough to experiment with which is an advantage.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I think you will not be disappointed.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"I say to just save your money and too stick with chinese rubbers.The friendship 729 lightening, higher or the 729-05 are some great rubbers, in order slow to fast with a more jap feel than a traditional one but still with tack like you mentioned."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),The outlaw and hurricane neo are much faster maybe 20% more but have less grip or hardly any.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I think i might throw in another side of the story  In order to switch from defensive to offensive gamestyle you need to go too a slower (5 layers without carbon) in order to inprove your skills.The problem with carbon blades is the they are very stiff and hard and therefore they offer very short dwell tim eand thereby control - when you have to change style it is too difficult to learn the strokes if the blade is too slow.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),In my opinion it is allways better to have fast rubbers and slower blade than fast blades and slow rubbers.I would think that a all+/off- blade would be a good choice.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I play Butterfly Jonyer Hinoki Special it is about off- it has very nice control and ok ok speed when you need it.I myself have gone from defensive style to offensive and Tenergy 05 opened a new world for me.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),If you choose the Tenergy 05 you just have to adapt to the hifgher throw angle and close the angle a little.On the back hand i would try out the Butterfly Roundell which is easy to handle and when you are ready you could then move on to faster bh rubbers.Good luck with the TT journey.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Thanks a lot to all of you for your help.I have taken some classes for a month and it was useful for correcting some of my strokes.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Infact my coach found some problems in my stroke itself.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Have gave me basic coaching.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),He told me that Firendship rubbers have one of the hardest sponge which is good for hitting.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"I'm still working on three C's Concentration, Control and Confidence."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Moreover reading opponent's spin and weakness is also important in the game.But I still feel I'm lacking some speed on my forehand.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"On my carbon blade, I presently have Geospin Tacky 1.9/2 mm."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I'm thinking of buying Geospin Tacky 2.2mm which would give me same rubber with higher speed.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Other options are IQUL 40Deg 2.2mm.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"I'm not sure as which one would be the right choice for my forehand.About my backhand, I don't do much looping."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Would IQUL 40Deg 2.2 mm also help me here ?Can Gambler outlaw/Wraith (2.2) FH, IQUL (2.2) would work OK ?I had one more setup which I stopped using after I bought Hinoki carbon.Blade: Aero 896 (medium allrounder)FH:729 CreamBH:RITC 2000 Tack Speed.But again this was more defensive setup that I felt during that time."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Also the overall weight was more and I wanted to move to lighter blade to gain reactive time.Do you think putting fast rubber on this paddle would help ??
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),How about Gambler outlaw/IQUL 2.2.Thanks.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),It takes months and months to improve your strokes.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Lots of hard work.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),That's what will make the difference.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Honestly, even the Aero setup should be fast enough to get you over 2000."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You just need the technique to produce the power.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Once again, it's hard work."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"It will also test your consistency, short game and tactics, because you won't be able to 'blast' a ball past your opponent in one shot."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Going to a much faster setup is a bit of a short cut.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"As for reactive time, develop anticipation and good footwork and the weight won't matter as much."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You seem to want to keep your current carbon blade.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"If you want to learn to loop more and be more allround-offensive, use IQUL 40 deg max on both sides."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"You could try 42 deg on the forehand of the carbon blade for more power, but I think at your level it will encourage blocking / hitting more than looping."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Avoid outlaw completely and avoid wraith unless you go with a slower, softer blade, like the Aero.IQUL will be noticeably faster than Geospin."

148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You should learn it all.

148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Thanks 8282**.I'll try IQUL 40 on both sides of carbon blade.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),What do you think of thickness.Should I go for 2.0 or 2.2mm ?
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),What's the difference ?Another choice would 729 Transcend (soft sponge) compare to geospin.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),But I think I should try IQUL first.If possible could you please let me know secure online shop to purchase it cheaply.Thanks.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Speedy you really should give IQUL a try.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Guys,Which Glue is better?Elmer's website has so many choices?"
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Is rubber cement OK ?
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I think it's available in local store here in US.I could buy some online but it's heavy and would spend a lot on shipping itself.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You say you live in us?

148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Thanks.I talk to Colestt about IQUL thickness.His personal opinion was to use IQUL 40 Deg 2.0 first.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),2.2/max would be very fast to handle.Also he suggested me to use Galaxy/Aero 896 blade (medium/off-) with these rubbers first.He wants me keep away the Hinoki Carbon away for some time.Today I played with Galaxy Instinct blade (slower than 896) with 2.2 LKT Torrent FH and 2.2 729 higher.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),My play was very fast and satisfying.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I believe these rubbers are slower than IQUL.Probably it would give me easy transition to IQUL.Personally I feel I can handle 2.2 but confused about 2.0/2.2.--ppwizard
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Good idea to get advice from Cole.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),He set me up over a year ago and my game went up by leaps and bounds.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Of course it took a lot of work but experienced and sincere advice never hurts.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),well with 2.0s you have greater control compared to 2.2s and thicker sponges.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),many prefer 2.2s to generate more power and spin.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),As for myself i try to generate more speed and spin through proper technique and 2.0s suit me better.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),You also get more feeling with 2.0s
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"  Same, I am of the school of thought that tends to think that you actually lose control if you bottom out and the wood comes into play."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"I find that if you develop proper technique, you will find that you are in control of the shot if the sponge does not bottom out."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Once it does, on a harde drive, then the blade is in control of your stroke."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"Just my feeling so I tend to go with max, 2.2 or 2.1 if that is available in some cases."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Point to be noted.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),Let me try 2.0 first.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),"If I feel confidence in control, I'll upgrade to 2.2 mm.Last night I played in my club and all the opponent's I faced was having Tenergy."
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),What is so special about Tenergy ?
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I'm tempted to buy these rubbers too since I can get it at almost half the price.
148,5f6c336f220a4650ffffdb34,Please suggest rubbers for me (chinese/Euro-Jap),I think I should probably try somebody else's paddle before investing though.But do you guys really think Tenergy is better in efficiency than IQUL/other rubbers if price is not in consideration ?
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"""On the other hand, it is also easier to create spin with tacky rubbers which might make some people lazy, as it is so easy to create spin with them."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"""So would you say you would become a better player with Euro/Jap rubbers because it makes you work harder?"
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"You could use the same argument by saying 'tacky rubbers are more sensitive to spin, so it makes you watch the spin more carefully."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Non-tacky rubbers make you lazy as they are less sensitive to spin'Both styles of rubbers have advantages and disadvantages, so neither is better than the other, they are just different and suit different styles."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,This is why you still find both types of rubbers even at the Elite levels.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,I think this isn't an issue to argue about.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Some people like a bouncy rubber, others like a linear rubber."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I think people buy the stuff they like, whether Japanese/European or Chinese rubber, because it conforms to what they expect the ball to do when they hit it."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Mostly a matter of ball feeling.I would say that you became a better player as a result of forgetting about the equipment and focusing on the other game elements.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"If Euro/Jap makes you play like this, then so be it."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Both have their strengths.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Tacky rubbers are great offensive weapons for the short game, serves and massively spinny loops.... however they are not as dynamic as euro type rubbers in that euro rubbers can have a lot of control, I find them easier to loop underspin with, and then with the right blade and sponge hardness they can still produce good mid distance loops."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,It depends on where the gears that you need most are at that makes for a good decision to go with one or the other.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"True about the top players in the world being chinese, but those players are lucky being able to just play TT in their lives."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,I do agree that the subject wasnt something to argue about.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,My friend just kept insisting that his chinese equipment was better than my Euro/Jap set up and kept insulting it.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,i told him i preferred it but being a good stubborn friend ignored what ive said.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Even though ive finally beaten him w/ my new set up, he still insists the chinese stuff was better.Thanks guys"
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Fantastic!
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Beat him up some more.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,But fortunate for me not to have such a friend who seems to be as stubborn as a mule.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Good fortune for you.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,i agree speedplay.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,My placement has improved greatly after i upgraded FROM chinese rubbers.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Playing w/ euro/jap made me understand what people talked about the ""GEARS"" of a rubber."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"i improved so much, i think i am ready for my first tournament which is going to be in Lakeland,Fl."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,A funny thing is that a lot of really good Chinese players use a tacky chinese rubber on their forehand and a Euro/Jap rubber on their backhand.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,And many of the professional chinese players who have come to Houston to coach use Butterfly rubbers.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"As everyone say, it really depends on your preference."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I have used both Jap rubbers (Sriver, Sriver EL, Tackifire), Euro (Tibhar Intra) and Chinese (729 Fx, 2000-Tack speeds), chinese rubbers are still the ones for me.In terms of quality."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I think Japanese & Euro rubbers are way ahead of chinese rubbers (in terms of rubber life, durability etc."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,").However, for a person who's just picking up the sport, I recommend the person to use chinese rubbers because its cheap."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"After the person have discovered his playing style, he can then decide to move on to better and more expensive rubbers."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,I am totally sold out on the IQUL 2.2 rubbers in 42 degree sponge.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,They cost just 16 dollars and at least for me are much better than the more expensive Srivers and Mark Vs.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I also find them to be fast, spinny and great for the short game."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"On the other hand this does not mean that Chinese is better than Euro/Jap, just that this particular product is a very good one, as are many other Chinese products."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"They are all good, or bad, players have their preferences and for a player who loves Euro equipment, that is the best, etc.I have just tried two Chinese products for the first time, a 5 dollar 729 FX rubber, and from the way it played, I think its an incredible steal at this price."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,The other rubber I tried out on a very hard Chinese Real blade is the Blutenkirsche Tokyo rubber.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"It seemed very tacky out of the box, but that wore off fast, and now it plays pretty much like a grippy rubber."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Again a decent Chinese product.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"The Euro/Jap rubbers usually last longer, usually are uniform with few if any quality control issues."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"But if the only factor was playablity, I am sure many Chinese rubbers are as good or better than Euro/Jap rubbers."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Better in fact if the factor was playablity to cost ratio.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I have a new club mate, in St. Joseph's Winter Haven Table Tennis Club, telling me that chinese rubbers are ideal for the younger players because it makes them work more."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I do agree with him, may it be looping underspin, emphasis on spin, or having to rely more on your technique to create speed."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,He mentioned that he prefers european rubbers because he is an older gentleman and doesnt have the bone and joints for the dynamics of creating his own speed.
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"Although chinese equipment do have quality issues, it comes with it with the cheap price tag."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,"I came up with the conclusion that chinese rubbers tend to make you focus on technique more than euro/jap style rubbers, although we all SHOULD focus on our techniques rather than equipment."
149,5f6c337c220a4650ffffdb3b,Chinese VS Japanese/European,Would you agree w/ my conclusion?Of course a player's preference is a major factor too since it is only my opinion

150,5f6c337d220a4650ffffdb3c,Tenergy 05 Speed comarison beetween 1.9 and 2.1 / max,"So nathan, would you also say that the the thinner Tenergy would actually be a better option unless somebody wanted the heavier blade, by virtue of the max rubber."
150,5f6c337d220a4650ffffdb3c,Tenergy 05 Speed comarison beetween 1.9 and 2.1 / max,"Cpens tend to become a little head heavy anyway since we leave that finger space, and the shorter handles."
150,5f6c337d220a4650ffffdb3c,Tenergy 05 Speed comarison beetween 1.9 and 2.1 / max,The 1.9 Tenergy might lessen that head-heaviness bit and still play just as well?
150,5f6c337d220a4650ffffdb3c,Tenergy 05 Speed comarison beetween 1.9 and 2.1 / max,Much depends on the target weight of the paddle and the hitting style of the player.

150,5f6c337d220a4650ffffdb3c,Tenergy 05 Speed comarison beetween 1.9 and 2.1 / max,I have only had one 1.9 rubber and it was the same weight as my 2.1 or maybe 1-2 grams lighter if my scale lied.Speed I believe comes from how you loop or drive the ball.
150,5f6c337d220a4650ffffdb3c,Tenergy 05 Speed comarison beetween 1.9 and 2.1 / max,more blade means faster.But to me I use the thickest rubber because I loop mostly and the more rubber or sponge I have I seem to feel the ball more gradually.On a lighter softer slower blade I think 1.7 even would be great.

151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"Some people find that change quite acceptable and therefore can make a sheet last for much longer... others need to change it as soon as they notice it, and therefore only get 4-6 weeks out of it."

151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"And I found the Roxon improved a little in feel as it ""wore in"" last time which compensated this."
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"The new sheet gives a little more spin on serve and is a little easier to slow loop with, but its only just noticeable to me."

151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Isn´t that thread about the Juic Air Condle Sound/Speed
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"It sure is, thanks for getting us back on track!"
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,No Prob
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"I just got a sheet of both Air Condle Sound and Speed.Topsheet looks the same as the regular Air Condle as expected..it's very grippy, the plastic sleeve actually sticks to the surface."
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"It won't be a tacky rubber though but obviously very grippy.I've measured the sponge hardness:Air Condle Sound: 33degThis put it in the same catagory as Donic F2, Almana Sound, Cornilleau Pilot Power in terms of sponge hardness.Air Condle: 36deg just for referenceAir Condle Speed: 39degThis put it in the same catagory as Sriver EL, Donic Platin, Cornilleau Pilot Advance in terms of sponge hardness.I will put them both on a blade and will do a comparison."
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"Hello,For those lucky of you who tried the Air Condle, could you tell me if the throw is low/medium and if the speed is higher compare to the Juic 999 Nano."
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"I think the rubber is less tacky as well.Cheers,Brahms"
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"The throw feels medium to me, considerwbly less than something like Tenergy or 999."
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"The rubber is quite a bit faster than the 999 nano, and it is non-tacky (compared to the 999 nano which is mildly tacky)"
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Thanks Haggisv for these precision.What about the spin ?
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Is the Nano better than Condle in this department ?
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Thanks Brahms
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,yes the spin on the nano is better.
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,"In all fairness, the Air Condle is a much faster rubber, so that's not really surprising."
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,Thanks Haggisv !
151,5f6c3397220a4650ffffdb4c,JUIC Air Condle Sound / Speed,I keep my Juic 999 ENCheers.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,ask yourself: is it playing any different?
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,Does it grip the ball as it did on the first weeks/months?You can also ask a regular playing partner who knows quite well of how you play.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,Ask him if it was any different compare to before.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,That's what we do when trying to decide to get new rubbers/equipment or not.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,The physical appearance of the rubber can also be a good indicator of how used up it is.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"You can often see a significant difference on the rubber surface, if you compare the area where you usually hit the ball to the edges of the rubber or the part nearer the handle which stays relatively new."
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"If there is a huge difference there it might be time to change the rubber.But more often then not, the best judge is playability."
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"Are your serves less spinny, loops have less kick in them, then I guess the rubber is dying, but not dead.At the end of the day it is a personal decision, some players change rubbers when they start to change characteristics, since they want to play with the rubber at its peak performance."
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"And some extract every last bit of juice from their rubbers, something I would not encourage."
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"As soon as another rubber takes your fancy.....oops, sorry, that's the EJ answer!!"
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"Seriously though, pay attention to how your rubber feels throughout its life in terms of its grippiness (on your serve, loop, chop, etc), its liveliness, how sweet your shots feel, stuff like that."
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,"When you feel dissatisfied with the rubber's performance, its time to change."
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,Some people find they don't mind playing with a dead-ish rubber and are happy to continue on with it.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,Others find that they are surprised how good a new rubber feels against what their previous rubber had slowly degraded to.
152,5f6c33aa220a4650ffffdb55,Rubber is dead/not playable - needs a change,I don't think you can put any hard and fast rules on it though.

153,5f6c33b9220a4650ffffdb5e,what new rubbers plays like glued sriver/vario,pretty much nothing plays close to a glued up rubber.
153,5f6c33b9220a4650ffffdb5e,what new rubbers plays like glued sriver/vario,Choose something new.
153,5f6c33b9220a4650ffffdb5e,what new rubbers plays like glued sriver/vario,take it from someone that knows and is still glueing.
153,5f6c33b9220a4650ffffdb5e,what new rubbers plays like glued sriver/vario,Nothing compares to a glued Sriver or any other rubber for that matter.
153,5f6c33b9220a4650ffffdb5e,what new rubbers plays like glued sriver/vario,"ok thanks for reply ,,that's pretty dissapointing to hear ""nothing plays like glued rubber"" , well can anyone give me a couple of rubber recomendations that might play close to something like a glued rubber or next best thing , what about hexer , boost or tenergy ?"
153,5f6c33b9220a4650ffffdb5e,what new rubbers plays like glued sriver/vario,?i would be gratefull for any advisewhy do they have to change these things ?
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,Tackiness C is quite slow.
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,A big disadvantage IMO would be returning serves with this rubber on your BH.
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,It's extremely tacky and it reacts to spin more than most rubbers.
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,"In this way short pips would be an advantage, as you would still be able to block/hit and return serves."
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,"maybe Tackiness-DI play a blocking, chop blocking, punching, driving and pushing game on my BH using Tackiness D (recently switched from short pips)."
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,Thing is -despite the name-it's not particularly tacky.
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,I like the firm sponge as I feel in complete control of my shots-but hardly ideal for looping-but might be ok with thicker sponge (?
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,)-I only have 1.5mm.Actually is there anyone here who uses Tackiness-D with a thicker sponge?-as I'm looking to develop more of a topspin game on my BH.
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,yeah my old coach used to use Tackiness 1.9 I believe he could still spin with it pretty well.
154,5f6c33cd220a4650ffffdb6a,Tackiness C/D for a consistent counter hitting game?,"I would definitely take Tackiness D. Everything seems so easy with this one -blocks are punchy, pushes deadly, counters easy......it really seems so"
156,5f6c33dd220a4650ffffdb76,Donic Waldner Tagora or Tenero replacement rubber?,"From the looks of it, Sriver EL or MK V ad would be the same, but much cheaper if you look overseas."
156,5f6c33dd220a4650ffffdb76,Donic Waldner Tagora or Tenero replacement rubber?,I would be interested in this as well.Sriver won't be much cheaper.
156,5f6c33dd220a4650ffffdb76,Donic Waldner Tagora or Tenero replacement rubber?,"So can anybody recommend something from the gigantic list of Friendship rubbers that has nice alround playing qualities like Sriver or Coppa Tagora rubbers, which I can offer my youth players as a cheaper alternative?"

157,5f6c33e6220a4650ffffdb7b,"Another new guy, rubber/blade question","Welcome to the forum ScfishrWell, IMO the best thing you can do is to get a blade and rubbers that everybody knows and that allow you to compare with all other kind of rubber/blades (I call this a ""Standard""), that allow to ""build"" your own game, style, and finally blade.OK, One typical Standard would be for example:Blade: Stiga OFFENSIVE or ALLROUNDRubbers: Yasaka Mark V 2.0 mm Red/black or Butterfly SriverIf you say that this combo is too fast, everybody in the world will understand what you mean, even if they have not watched you playing.Another (cheaper, chinese, slower) combo:Blade: LKT InstinctRubber: Friendship 729 (This combo is really easy and cheap to get in e-bay, for example)I'm sure that anyone can suggest you something to begin with."

157,5f6c33e6220a4650ffffdb7b,"Another new guy, rubber/blade question",In my opinion you can't go wrong if you choose the Yasaka Mark V or the Butterfly Sriver.

158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),He is mainly a blocker but his active play improved very rapidly already.
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),He is attacking in positions where he used to block passively and that suprises cost me a few more points!

158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),As always the packaging the rubber is in was basic yet amazing just like notmal Andro packaging.
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),my one problem is how cluttered the rubber stamp is.
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"I understand these new rubbers have to have their code on to prove they're legal, but because of that all the tensor bios logos were forced onto one side and the stamp just looks cluttered."
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I took a photo on my iPhone and when I get a chance to upload I will show you what I mean.
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"gona try and have a knock tonight before I play my match tomorrow night as I want to get a feel of the rubberone thing I will say, it feels a little bit heavier then R450, and the sponge is a very odd looking sponge, I dont mean the fact its red, I mean the look of it, it almost has that washing sponge look to it if you know what i mean lol"
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"yeah I got a black sheet, always dealt with black because I believe it lasts longer and provides more grip."
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"But as for the sponge, red, orange, its the same thing, I just called it red lol."
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),Like I said earlier when i can find out how to upload photos from the iPhone to the net (I might just ahve to plug it into the PC....) I'll show.
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),I would use my normal camera but its not good for closeups lolI expect I might get the same duribility problems but being i have a black sheet it might be diferent
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"Maybe a bit of Olive oil would ""moisturise"" the Hexer's grip?"
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"well if thats the case, I hope Spinmax will see me through the end of the season"
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),happens!
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),spinmax aqua cures it ... better than original.
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"looks like I need to get that edging tape on mine and do that tonightwell I had a hit with it, just a hit, knocking up against guys who dont want you to work on your new rubber is hard to play."
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"But I did notice the spring diference, took no time to adjust to but was funny at first, the rubber felt slower, but then again it is slower then 450."
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"But spin (when I had a chance to use it) was very nice, hard to compare with R450 but the counter topspins felt effortless, I think that lack of spring helps get a nice smooth counter topspin."
158,5f6c33fd220a4650ffffdb86,Review: Andro Hexer according to me. (vs Roxon 450/500),"A small note, when I connected perfectly when going for the loop fir time I thought the ball was cracked, it made that much of a nice noise lol"
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?","I feel that the Proton I am using now is about same speed to the Roxon, however with a much firmer sponge I feel the Proton is a little harder to control."
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?","Both still require a good stroke, but I feel the Roxon was just that touch more forgiving."
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?","So its control is not always just about the speed, the rubber characteristics can influence the control available at the same speed."
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?","Of course, there are other subtle differences too in the way different rubbers can play with respect to this."
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?","It's all about the short game for me, and as Yuzuki pointed out best tested in tense conditions."
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?","Am I comfortable touching short, can I dig a little extra on an occasional push, can I push an odd ball right off the bounce to get more spin, can I misdirect a push when I see an opponent move, can I receive serve well?"
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?",Can I do these things without constantly worrying about going too long.If I can do these things I will certainly be OK in the offensive and blocking games (and strangely also chopping away from the table).If I cannot the better players will destroy me with a superior short game- the foundation of a good player's skills.
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?",For me it's all about the short game.
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?",If I have trouble pushing or blocking then it is too fast.
159,5f6c33ff220a4650ffffdb87,"Too fast, or just fast enough?",Service spin and how tight I can get the serve.
160,5f6c341d220a4650ffffdb9a,Speed glue/tuned rubber with tacky topsheet & soft sponge,This might be up your alley:http://eacheng.net/index.php?act=detail&ID=2688I've got a sheet on the way...
160,5f6c341d220a4650ffffdb9a,Speed glue/tuned rubber with tacky topsheet & soft sponge,"The sponge is hard on that one, although i quite like the rubber.Haifu Shark II probably fits the bill closer, but it's only mildly tacky."
161,5f6c3436220a4650ffffdba6,"Fh-rubber, going from Roxon 450/500 to ?","I think T05 would be very good for you, considering it feels very good on my KLHS."

163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Maybe try a faster Chinese Rubber, like Faster 3 or Focus 2 or if you're really out there Outlaw."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,I heard those all have relativley low throw angles spinmeister.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,That would make them harder to loop underspin if I'm correct.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,I may give one a try tho.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Thanks.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap, Is that a hard blade or a soft flexible blade.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,I think cream plays much better on a hard blade.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,It sounds like you play close to the table.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"I think in friendship stuff 729-05 or -02 (tensor) may give you a little more power from the FH side, but still allow good serving."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Going to a euro/jap rubber will change how you serve.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,In friendship focus 3 or outlaw are much less chinese and loop well.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Outlaw will block and smash better than focus 3.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,I think the problems you are describing have little to do with equipment.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"If anything, I would switch to a slower blade with better feel and get some coaching."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Whatever money you are planning to put into equipment is probably better spent taking lessons.I play with a super low throw chinese rubber on the FH (H2), slapped onto a blade much slower than yours (Darker 5P-2A) and I am not having any of those problems."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"I am having all sorts of other problems, but they can also be clearly traced to insufficient training.ILya"
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Seems like you would just have to adjust to the rubber at this point, no need to buy a new one."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Try making the high-spinny ball into a mid-low spinny ball, it'll do wonders to annoy your opponent.Either that or start making them more around for that backhand attack that you mentioned."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Make it difficult for them by placing it rather deep or into their body.I am of this opinion because you mentioned that you liked it for serving and you play a third-ball attack style of play.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Chinese rubbers excel at that, I believe."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Thanks for the replys.I believe ILya is correct in saying that my blade may be too fast.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,I bought it thinking lighter = better and not knowing exactly how the different types of blades would really affect my play.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"What would be a good, relatively cheap, blade that would work well for me?"
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,I do also know that I need more time training.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Time seems to be my greatest enemy though...Alternatively, I would like to not replace my blade."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,So the question is to continue with what I am using and just train more or try another FH rubber.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Let me know what my best course of action would be.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Either choose a classic all-wood blade or train more.
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Time is precious, but if you set goals for each session, you'll probably see concrete results faster."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,"Hi esc123, yes the first thing is just slow the shot down a bit untill your strokeplay is better, and bats and rubbers can be expensive so chosing one that works is a great relief."
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,On the other hand whenever you get an oppertunity try some of your mates blades and rubbers as this a quick way of trailing products and you will gain info on your mates likes and dislikes of thier gear Also keep an eye out for any German /Jap rubbers 1.8mm and over on special as there is nothing wrong with trying new stuff either:P
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap," Hi just remember to break your forehand shots down Firstly if thier ball is high (even with spin) adjust for the spin and then just hit the ball hard (try not to loop high balls ) Secondly Keep trying the 729 Cream Transcend but give it a clean as it may have lost its tack which helps you loop the longer ballsThirdly Sometimes when your opposition get your loops back it may be because you hit the the same place ,so vary your placement and this will help with your stroke play and statagy as well"
163,5f6c346f220a4650ffffdbc4,Switching from Chinese FH Rubber to Euro/Jap,Thank you for all the constructive criticism.

164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,I am a chop attacker and I chop with my forehand about 70% of the time and as of right now I am using LKT Silver dragon on my forehand and I find that it can chop and bring down balls very well and give you big arcing loops but I also use 2.2 thickness and the sponge is relatively soft I am not sure if you would like it but I find that it is pretty easy to use... hope this helps
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Dr N Domination Tuned is the one of the softest rubber I used and it's good for chopping as well as attack.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Even Evgueni Chtchetinine uses the 1.0mm hard sponged (by comparison) Tripple Spin Chop, and chose it way back before he attacked as much as he does these days.There must be something about harder sponged rubbers for chopping that I've missed?"
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Do you like tacky (sticky) rubbers?
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"If so, you should be able to try a few Chinese options pretty cheaply."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,I believe the standard place to start is pf4-1.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,If you find that you want to stick with softer rubbers you might give gambler reflectoid a try which would also be a nice and cheap option.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"A good topic, it's something I've wondered about too.A soft sponged rubber, expecially a thin one, is going to bottom out if your opponent hits it hard enough."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"The higher level you go, the harder they hit the ball."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Brushing it really hard can reduce this effect, but I think this get really hard against fast balls."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I suspect at the higher levels, they MUST be able to generate heavy backspin on their chops, and if a rubber bottoms out this will be harder to do.If you want to counter loop, then a really soft and thin sponge is hopeless as well, as it bottoms out even on medium pace loops."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"A 1.2mm sponge is very thin... we do have a few player that play with 1.8mm soft sponge, and are still able to loop quite effectively unless it's hit really hard...I think with a non-tacly rubber, it would be much easier to generate heavy backspin in the short game."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"For a hard sponged rubbers you'd need a tacky surface to do this so that you can brush it finely, where the hard sponge does not reduce the dwell time as well...These are the main contribting factors I can think off... Hopefully some of our inverted choppers can add some more comments?"
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,It could probably well be the idea of being able to chop a hard-hit ball with good backspin.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Remember kagin's thread regarding Preventing Dead Balls in the Anti section?

164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"With harder sponge is easier to control where you want to put the ball, and it allows you to have more time for the ball to stick on tacky rubber so you can change the spin easily."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I still remember my coach back then keep saying, chopping is not about putting the heaviest backspin on the ball, where you place it is the most important ones (Placement, speed, and control)."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"No matter how much backspin it has, if you place it not deep enough, or doesn't have enough speed, your opponent still can smash the ball."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"From my experience, it is easier to chop with hard sponge coz its more consistent, and you dont have to deal with bouncy sponge, so less variable to deal with."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"With hard sponge, you can chop the ball with shorter stokes (like ding song) which will give you plenty of time to react, plus it is easier to change the spin by varying short and long strokes."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"And, a BIG plus is you dont have to chop far far away from the table, so less running around."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Im classically trained as traditional defender back in my high school days and my coach gave me my first blade which is matshusita pro with PF4-1 and 802.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Its hard to get PF4-1 these days.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,I heard they stop producing it anymore?Now i use Nittaku Hurricane 2 NT50 which have very firm sponge (a tad harder than TSP real).
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,I find that rubber has a nice balance for chopping and counter attacking capabilities.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"That is a great post, thank you KenT!Welcome to the forum!"
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Yes, thanks from me also Ken.I don't understand more dwell time to put spin on the ball (my short experience with hard rubbers is they give you less time as the ball doesn't sink into the sponge in the same way), but the rest of what you said is very interesting."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"The high level choppers wouldn't using such hard sponge without some reason, I just didn't understand it."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Now to try it myself.BTW, I always admire short pip choppers - it takes lots of skill to handle the big loops."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"@Haggisv: You're very welcome@Shoebox9: Harder sponge doesn't mean its faster than softer sponge, it has slower (deadish) feel, so basically you create the spin with the tacky top sheet of your rubber."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Its true that softer sponge has more dwell time, but it works like catapult too."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"You have to calculate the momentum of the ball from you're opponent coz the more momentum it have, more trouble you gonna get."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,You cannot absorb it well because of the catapult characteristic from softer rubber.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"You can neutralized and change the spin, but it will be hard for soft sponge to change the pace becoz you're dependent on your opponent momentum."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"But, modern defender now days are using softer rubber coz they dont chop much, they attack more."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Hope this ancient traditional point of view helps.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Well, it is the same principal with long pips too."

164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I'm finding the Tackifire very slow, even compared to Tango Def 1.2, which will probably force me to learn a better chopping stroke, and ultimately allow me to chop more of those fast loops."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"At the moment I rarely return the second fast loop, if I get the first- so I'm finally willing to trade off some of the amazing spin you can add to slow balls with ultra soft rubbers, and get serious about trying to tackle the better players by returning their big loops instead."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Thanks.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I only play briefly with tackifire D, so i cant compare much.As i can recall, tackifire D has medium sponge right?"
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I find tackifire has a nice speed for chopping and attacking, but i cant generate enough underspin on short strokes."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"Hurricane 2 nt50 is slower than tackifire becoz of the tacky topsheet, the speed that you can get really dependent on your body movement and strokes ( chinese play ), but with other japanese or euro rubber, you can get speed with their sponge."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"The thing i like about NT50 is, the speed glue effect come only when needed."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"The rubber is dead when im chopping, but come alive when i start punishing the ball."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,You should see how Koji handle those big loops.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"He chop with tackifire D, and he's running around and chopping the ball like crazy."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I think you need really good footwork if you want to chop with that rubber.In my opinion, if you chop 80% with your forehand, stick with slow rubber, and learn how to chop those fast loop."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,You can always add speed with your own body powers later on.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"And one more thing, all of those attackers hate slow but very spinny balls."

164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Do hard rubbers suit my game??

164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I started playing further back, like 2m, and taking the ball around thigh/kneee height and I find it easier to return."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,Hard sponge is much easier to chop with for me.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,The problem is I can't attack well with it.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,I really like chopping with Tackifire C 1.7mm.

164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,I'm also using the Defense Tango.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,It's a bit harder to control due to the glued-up effect.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,It has incredible speed for a 1.2 sponge.
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"If you want to play a classical defensive game, which I do too, and you can only return one speedy loop, it seems you need a non-tensor rubber with a sponge around 1.0 - 1.3mm."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"BTW, tackifire is not a slow rubber, but compared to the tensor-like Tango, it probably seems slow."
164,5f6c3476220a4650ffffdbc8,Hard or soft inverted for chopping?,"I chopped with Tackifire D a lot, and it's okay, but I prefer a harder sponge.Good luck!"

165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,Perhaps boost TP might be a cheaper alternative.
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,Bryce Speed is actually an excellent rubber.
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,Bryce is the one I have a problem with.
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"Bryce Speed has a much grippier topsheet, and better speed, whilst maintaining similar control properties.The thing with BS that I found to be really unique is that it was horrible to kill backspin with, the margin of error was so low, and the shot produced was less than exceptional."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"However, I could counter loop off the bounce with it very easily and the ball is much, much, much faster than even tuned Chinese stuff.To the point now: because of this uniqueness, I've never found anything that could truly mimic BS."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,The ones that come close are all in the Butterfly range.
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"I'll see if there's any windfall of cash in the near future then, as I really liked the properties of tuned/glued Bryce, and can't really control Tenergy 25 on the backhand well enough for it to be game-worthy."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"It has a lot of potential, however.As for Almana, I just hope this incoming Sterco (two sheets) would be enough to tide me over while waiting for Bryce Speed.Thanks for the rather quick replies, you two."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,The Almana is quite similar to Sterco in many ways...
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"Yeah, that's why I asked for a couple from you."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"I'm hoping that Sterco is merely a spinnier, slower version of Bryce Speed (a spinnier Almana if you will) with a sponge which doesn't require tuning."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"I've tried it before on the forehand, a long time ago, so I'm not sure about it's properties now with my current skill set.Interesting that views change as people change."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"I'm amazed at the ability of Tenergy 25 for the backhand, but with my current self, I can't work it out well enough."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"Try Dawei Saviga, it's cheap so trying one won't kill you"
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"Yes, I've seen the Saviga too.It's meant to be a Butterfly Bryce clone, and all of the reviews about it are positive as well.Worth a try, because it's fairly cheap."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"IMO it only comes close to bryce in the hard sponged version, and when it's glued up..."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"Ive tried Saviga,Inspirit and Inspirit Quattro and they are not in the same league as Bryce."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,I would Suggest Platin on the bh side.I have tried many bh rubbers but this one i brilliant in serve return hitting looping.I have Tenergy 05 on the fh and this is a perfect combo..
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"I agree actually, from my experience of talking to sponsored players, apparently the combo shown on the Donic site: some blade + JO Gold (FH) + Platin (BH) is the best thing since the glue ban (for Donic users), so +1 for the Platin idea."
165,5f6c34c4220a4650ffffdbf9,Bryce/Bryce Speed Substitutes?,"Thanks to both, as Platin is as expensive as Silver here locally, I'll give it a shot if I decide to buy Donic.But my first and lasting impression of Platin is it's like a Sriver EL Tensor, so I'm not particularly inclined in that route.I find JO Gold a bit too low throw and a bit too hard for my backhand, needing much armspeed, but certainly has a faster ball."

166,5f6c34f4220a4650ffffdc19,Rubbers:F/H-Nittaku Reforma Max B/H-Butterfly Sriver EL Max?,I used Refoma and I think it is pretty good.
166,5f6c34f4220a4650ffffdc19,Rubbers:F/H-Nittaku Reforma Max B/H-Butterfly Sriver EL Max?,It lasts fairly long.
166,5f6c34f4220a4650ffffdc19,Rubbers:F/H-Nittaku Reforma Max B/H-Butterfly Sriver EL Max?,The best I have seen it was on a Juic Air Carbon (super thick balsa carbon)http://www.juic.co.jp/product/racket/pi ... bon_01.jpghttp://www.juic.co.jp/product/racket/pi ... bon_04.jpgTons of spin and lasted forever on that blade.

167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","Regarding thick rubbers on the backhand, I find this true for me:Now, this possibly will not be similar to your observations."
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","To try it out, you can flip your current bat over and try the 2.1mm rubber on your forehand for a short drill or two."
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.",The ball feel and confidence to play all kinds of balls should be there.
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.",all right does everyone see it this way ?Or is it just yuzuki  I would really want to know everybody`s oppinion regarding this..
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","If you are an intermediate player or better, I advocate using the maximum thickness on both sides."
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","If this is impossible to control, use a slower blade or slower sponge."
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.",Platin is very fast.
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","I find the 1,8 Platin easy to control.I just wonder how different the max rubber will be.I was told that the max thickness needs firm/hard strokes and by now I hit the ball pretty hard."

167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","It will take you a couple of weeks to get used to it, probably, and then you will like it better."
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","Here's the rub: Some rubbers have maximum thicknesses of more than 2.1-2,2mm like some European rubbers."
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.","Others, like Tenergy and Bryce, have it maxed out at 2.1mm.It's a little iffy for me to say this, but I 'play drill OK' with 2.1mm Tenergy 25 on the backhand, which is the maximum thickness of the particular rubber.So, I guess I am playing max on the backhand?"
167,5f6c34fb220a4650ffffdc1d,"Platin 1,8 / max for the backhand.",I will test the Platin max one of the coming days And will then see how big the difference will be.I will let you know how it feels.

169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I found it great for serves also.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,As a result i found out that i prefer harder rubbers.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I have played with bryce and i liked it.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,The hardness allowed me to get more power into my loops aswell as the spin.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,This is IMO.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Hence without knowing how your game is i would not like to suggest a rubber for you to purchase - just in case it comes out to become a terrible set up and you hate me for it   Ps: Once edited i will give more info...
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"It looks like I'm getting mixed responses, which isn't a good thing for me  .To Ilovetabletennis and others, I knew I should of given more info, but due to laziness to type I left it out."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Anyway, my FH loop is pretty good."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I have been coached by a Chinese Provincial Team player and she has taught be the Chinese looping game, which consequently means looping with legs + waist + extended arm."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I can put loop close and away from table.I have used Six Shooters and Outlaw for my FH before, and I quite liked Six Shooters on my FH for looping even though Six Shooters is supposedly a better rubber for a backhand-blocking style of game (I love from both wings anyhow)."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I have not bought tried many rubbers (only tried around four).
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"So, is hard for me to say what hardness of rubber I would like frpm this small sample."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"However, I would like a rubber that has almost the same feel as Six Shooters, which I think might be medium-soft?"
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I have used the Outlaw for a month now and even though I can loop with it with no problem, I don't like its feel, which could be medium-hard or hard?Furthermore, if this helps according to my coach I could be easily rated 1800+ but because tournaments are held on Sundays at my club, I can't play them (I have to work  )."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I have beaten players that are 1800+ too.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?, Have you tried G2FX?
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Yes it's soft, but I don't find it grippier or spinnier than Bryce."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Bryce is a respectable rubber without glue.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"If speedglue had never been invented, G2FX wouldn't have either (IMO Sriver L is better for pretty much anything)."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I dare anyone to say something good about G2FX that doesn't involve speedglue/tuners:)
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Ok so here is my little comparison, I hope it helps."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Thanks again for giving me a bit more info it will help me with my advice.G2fx - A low throw, soft, light rubber that's not super fast, nor powerful compared to bryce and other tensor rubbers."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I must admit even if i dislike this rubber it is very good in every catorgory.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Very well balanced, It most proberly plays better on a faster blade, as it will allow you to gear up more easily."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Also the durablity of this rubber is long lasting.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Hence a good rubber for intermidiate players who cannot handle upgraded rubbers such as Tenergy.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,This rubber performs MUCH better with speed glued or if it is tuned.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,When serving with this rubber i can really get some nice spinny serves which kick off the table or kick off peoples bat.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Bryce- This is an excellent rubber, low throw rubber for pure offense, It's one of the best blocking rubbers I used and its also great for driving and smashing."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"In the short game is a little bit more difficult to control, but this is when practice comes in handy!"
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Very good for power looping.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Comparing it to G2FX it has LESS spin.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"But has MUCH more speed (if that makes sense ) When i served with this rubber i also found it spinny, it also gave me nice control over the shot.On the other hand...If you like six shooters why do you want to change rubbers?"
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Wouldn't it be easier and more effiecent to buy a rubber you played with an enjoy playing with?
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Is it becasue you feel like you are gettign a really good offer on the two rubbers?
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"( I smell a ongoing EJ  )If you really want to buy the rubber why dont you purchase them if they are cheap, and then sell them on with a bit more $$$ on top (make a profit)?"
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Then you could buy a few more Six Shooters!
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I cannot say much about Outlaw as i have not used it (i would have but i got Tenergy).
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Thanks.For some reason, I have the impression that the G2-FX is more of a smashing-kind-of-rubber than a looping rubber.And, I'm not buying another Six Shooter rubber even though I like it because the quality is bad."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,After a month of playing with the rubber the edges had fallen apart to the point that I have to change rubbers.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Then, I bought the Outlaw and in less than a week there are already cracks at the edges of the rubber."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I mean Gambler might make good-playing rubbers, but gosh the quality is horrible."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"By the way, I don't hit the edges of the table.Furthermore, I'm changing rubbers because my coach and other players better than me say that I need to upgrade rubbers since I have gotten better."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I feel the same way too.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,They all recommended me Tenergy 25 and they say it suits my style.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"However the rubber cost $60, and I don't feel like paying that much yet."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I'm getting the Bryce and G2FX for only $20 each, so I decided to give them a try."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Fair Enough.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I think if you will be speed gluing/ tuning buy the G2fx OR if your going to play standardly buy the bryce.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Unless you seek to play with a slower rubber.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"So, I decided to buy both rubbers today since they were cheap  ."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Tried the Bryce first and I didn't like it.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,The rubber was too hard for my taste.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,No feeling at all.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"Then tried the G2-FX, and I liked this one."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,Same feeling as my Six Shooters but a little bit faster.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"No need for speed gluing (never done it before) to get speed, since I use my full arm/stroke and get enough speed with it."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I'm quite happy with the G2-FX, a soft rubber which is what I like."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"I am glad you took both of them, One of the first questions i asked was, do you like soft or hard rubbers, you wasn't able to answer it since you didnt know."
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,I asked this first because this was one of the key differences.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,If you was able to give me a accurate response i could have told you which one you prefer.
169,5f6c350b220a4650ffffdc29,Bryce or Sriver G2-FX?,"But atleast now you know what your style is like, sell on the bryce  if i was near you i would have purchased it.I hope the rubber plays well for you."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,Sounds like a built in feature.... you get a really tricky rubber that starts out spinning lots and then fools the opponent by turning into anti (without twiddling)!
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Just better have something grippy on the other side lol.Its our winter here, so I won't experience this for at least 6 months I'd say."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,I have heard of this happening before with other rubbers but have not experienced it myself.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,It is starting to get hot here so I will be watching for it.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,China should be a good test for this.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,IIRC Bryce has the same problem.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"But to solve it on the day of a tournament is just to hit with a thicker contact (drive more than loop).Another problem, I'd imagine is when it gets cold."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Last weekend, during a tourney my Solcion didn't bite the ball and had a sponge of Sriver hardness."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,All good things finds flaws from somewhere right?
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,(Corollary to Murphy's Law) ahhaha
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"It happens plenty of times in a close hall and no air con, and like you said, during hot summer days."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Ive experienced it with chinese rubber, same with others in the same room."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,You gotta keep it dry and wipe of the moisture (notice when you wipe it off with your hand it takes ages to dry)
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,LKT Rapid Sound is just like this.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,I suspect a number of other rubbers do that to some degree.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,No fresh air circulation + sweaty bodies + some time = bad conditions for everyone's rubbers.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Usually, I experience a different problem first."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"I sweat so much that when I loop, 20 droplets of tiny sweat fly everywhere and land on my rubber and the table near the endline."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,It takes me maybe 1 match to get this sweaty and only stops when I go to the artic circle for ice fishing.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"One way to deal with cold rubbers is to make a microwaveable pouch, heat it up and store it with your rubbers during transport."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"beans, corn, or rice are nice material to use."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"You simply get some spare cloth, place some of the material on it, fold it over, and sew it to the shape/size you want times and repeat."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Sounds like a corky idea, but it is real useful to keep half frozen rubbers the right temperature."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,Another use is to heat the stuff up and use it for body/joint aches that require heat treatment or to simply warm the feet up.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"That one would require a little planning and minimal skill to sew it so it looks like an oversized sock, but would do you great service in the winter nights."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"I think this phenomenon occurs in some other rubbers, not only Outlaw.Did you ask around if there were other people who were experiencing the same problem during that day?"
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Yes I've had it quite a few rubbers too, in hot and humid conditions... pips or anti on both sides should do the trick"
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"No, I didn't think to ask around, but I didn't notice anyone else going on a rubber cleaning binge, either."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,It may be that Outlaw is particularly susceptible to this problem and is among the first to fall when things get clammy.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,OMG!
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,It's melting!!!!
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,Sounds like its the humidity.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"Instead of using a cleaner which just adds moisture, have you tried wiping/dabbing at it with a dry cloth, or tissue paper maybe?"
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,Tonight I cleaned it with a slightly damp cotton towel and it worked well for de-slicking Outlaw.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"The last time I played with the Outlaw it was about 80 F outside and around 65% RH, and due to ""economic"" conditions we could not get the money for air-conditioning in our club."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,So it does get pretty warm here.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,Before playing though I used 1 pump/spray of Kinetix Rubber Revitalizer (Good Stuff) and rubbed it off with a regular sponge.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,I use it mainly to keep dust and grime off and the fresh new rubber tack is a pleasant by-product.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,"I had good grip throughout, absolutely no issues."
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,My serves are not as spinney but the Outlaw is not all that tacky anyway.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,I think I had been previously just spoiled by Chinese Tacky stuff.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,I agree with gekorark that I do loop drive and counterloop more than brush loop which relies more on Topsheet tack and elasticity than the sponge.
170,5f6c355b220a4650ffffdc5c,Gambler Outlaw becomes slick in hot/humid weather,But look at it this way hitting will be amazing as your rubber is almost anti-spin  .
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Most of the rubbers you mentioned are quite fast and harder to control.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Obviously this is all relative but the best chopping rubber hands down is the Geo Spin Tacky.If you have a faster blade then go with the 1.5mm thick otherwise stick with the 2.0mm.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"The 1.5 is really a lot slower than the 2.0, but would be more controlled.GST gives you the impression you are totally in control when chopping, and the amount of spin you can produce is quite amazing."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Tenergy 05 does provide insane spin, but it is a fast rubber and even 1.7 can be too bouncy.The soft rubbers like Reforma are going to feel great for chopping but then on power drives and kill balls, they loose so much energy."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"This applies to tacky rubbers as well, but they tend to have hard sponges which helps to speed smashes up.Geospin Tacky or Transcend SP are good choices.Again, Macro Era is a tensor made for offensive play so it doesn't really fit in with chopping.If you're mainly chopping, I would go for something which suits chopping."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Thanks.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"The Geospin Tacky does sound appealing in a lot of respects, but I'm a bit concerned about its sensitivity to incoming spin, though I also think it's probably in my own interest, long-term, to learn to do a better job of dealing with such spin."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,802-40
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Maybe try an antispin.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Great for close in chopping and flat hitting high balls as you described.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Joola Tango Defense in 1.2mm.Or if you want something cheaper a double happiness PF4, or the geospin tacky between 1.5-1.8mm thickness."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I would not go any thicker as it might be too fast
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Butterfly Tackiness Chop with a thin sponge (say 1.3) would give you great chopping ability and still hit if you can apply enough force of your own.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I think it is probably at least on a par with GST, but is probably a little softer which can feel nicer for touch purposes."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Ironically its not tacky, but very grippy."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,So there's no concerns about the tack wearing off or it attracting so much dust.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Interesting suggestions; what about G666?
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I'd say its more of a looping rubber, but again with a thin sponge it would probably be ok. Not sure if you know this or not, but I will say it just in case you don't."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,The issue with a rubber for chopping is that it doesn't want to be too fast or bouncy otherwise the ball is gone before you get much chance to inflict any great degree of spin on it.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,This means that a thicker sponge will eject the ball out quicker and be worse for chopping.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Obviously the more grip you get from the topsheet the better, whereas with a looping rubber it can come from the sponge or the topsheet because you can apply more force to the ball as you are giving the ball downward force."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"It is more delicate chopping because you give upward force generally, so you can't rely much on the sponge to provide this, it has to come from the topsheet."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"A chopped ball will float in the air and go further, whereas a topspin ball will be dragged down by the spin force."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,So in seeking a chopping rubber you need to look for a very grippy or tacky topsheet with a thinner or deader sponge.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Alternatively you can join us on the darkside and use long pimples which vary in the amount of chop spin they create themselves, but take the topspin of the opponent and send it back as underspin when using a chopping action."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Anti-spin rubbers will do something similar, though I don't use it, so can't be very detailed on its effects."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Hope this was useful.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Thanks, Count Darkula."

171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"and have been playing with the Phoenix since the ban, and while I like its predictability and control (which made it a great first rubber for learning the friction game), it's also pretty predictable for many of my adversaries, so this summer I'm going to be trying some less predictable (for myself and opponents) replacement candidates others have liked, such as the Bomb Talent and D.Techs."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"But, returning to the issue at hand -- which is my forehand -- the explanation you gave is very clear and helpful; I do sort of understand what I need but don't necessarily know the characteristics of some of the rubbers (since I tend to settle on one rubber for awhile and stick with it), which is why I'm relying on all the great advice I've gotten in this forum."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Based on what I've read thus far and my own independent research, my thinking, so far, is between the Geospin Tacky and Tackiness Chop."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"In favor of the former (Geospin) is that I'm more used to the tacky Chinese-style rubber (having played with the H3 for awhile), but, on the other hand, if I want to avoid sensitivity to incoming spin, the Tackiness Chop is probably a better alternative if I learn how to use its grippiness to my advantage."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Correct?
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Another consideration is that I'd want, ideally, as much variation between my FH and BH as possible, and I read in an old post in some other forum that the Tackiness Chop would actually provide more differentiation from my BH (assuming long pips on the BH side) than a tacky rubber like the Geospin."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Is this right?
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Does anyone have any insight into why or why not.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I'm pretty clueless about this.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,(Sorry about the long post.)
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I have the GST in 1.5mm and have no problem dealing with incoming spin.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,You might need a bit of practice to get used to it but it won't take long.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I think the key is not being passive.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"If you need to return a heavy backspin ball over the table then chop it back, the spin you generate will be insane."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"If the ball is long, I have no problems waiting for the ball to clear the table and looping it back."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,(Brush looping that is.)
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"If you alternate between a heavy chop and a heavy brush loop, 90% of the time your opponent will overshoot.I have never tried the tackiness chop so I can't really comment."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,From what I gather it is also a good rubber.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I don't think you would go wrong either way.Variation between the FH and the BH is an interesting issue.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"If you can twiddle, the bigger the difference will really cause 2 winged loopers a LOT of trouble, HOWEVER you will not be as effective against combination players that can read spin.I found that out since I used to play with the Meteor 8512 on my BH.I am now using the yaska 007 which is probably one of the grippiest LPs out there, but the key again is to be very active."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"The grippiness allows me to be very agressive over the table, but for some strange reason it is not too sensitive to incoming spin."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Choping away from the table is a dream.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,The 007 is naturally disruptive so it provides enough variation from the GST.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,What I like with the 007 is that you are more in control of the spin you generate.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,You can send back a float or a very heavy backspin depending on what you want.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,The action is just slightly different.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Yes, I haven't seen that issue addressed much, i.e., what kind of rubber - tacky or grippy - results in more spin variation and opponent mistakes when paired with long pips on the BH."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,TT I would try the GST first.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Its not going to be as expensive as the Tackiness Chop, so you will get a cheaper solution if it works for you."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"If not, well its was about $20 down."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,If you did it the other way around you'll outlay about $40 first up.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I'm just not sure how long the GST's tackiness lasts, whereas the Tackiness will give long service."

171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,sorry I didn't notice before you were already a full-fledged dark member.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Trouble with Geospin is that it needs priming/boosting to break it in.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,The other way to break it in is to play alot with it prior to really using it.

171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,The debate really is whether really tacky rubber or grippy rubber are preferred.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,This has generated quite a bit of disagreement.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Another good point there Mathias.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Chinese rubbers can be a pain to break in.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"With priming technically illegal, it makes it hard."

171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Good suggestions there Matias, agreed Chinese rubber needs some breaking in, it really depends whether the user likes to use a hard or a soft sponge, and yes tacky or grippy rubber."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I tend to use the grippier rubber myself, as the chinese rubber with out speedglue feels to slow.I feel that if I can not attack a ball than I am losing half of my points."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"If I had a choice bewteen GST and Tackiness Chop, I would choose Tackiness Chop any day.I find it easier to control on chops (soft sponge) and that it also can create more spin than tacky rubbers (on chops)."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"It is also less sensitive to spin compared with GST because of the soft sponge.Anyway, as long as the sponge is thin, you can flat hit fast!"
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,PS.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Tackiness chop isn't too expensive.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Yeah, the $32 or so that it seems to be selling for on most sites isn't that bad compared to Tenergy or some of the other new stuff, although, of course, it's more than Chinese rubbers."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Agreed.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,It took my GST about a good week to break in.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Just clean it with water though.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,When I first took it out of the package it was hardly tacky.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,But the more you use it and clean it with just water the more tacky it becomes...
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I hate to throw something else into the mix.

171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,That handle is way too small for me.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Ben I find your comment about GST getting tackier with use very interesting.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,It goes against every other tacky rubber I've known.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I've held off trying that rubber because its slow rep doesn't suit my game, but that's one more point in its favour that now tempts me lol."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I used to use a Juic 999 Defense (not Elite Defense), and I wasn't that crazy about its chopping ability (the H3 has worked much better for me, though I'm looking to try something else now)."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I've always been under the impression that the Elite Defense was not as spinny as the regular 999 Defense.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Is that wrong?
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Yes it is a bit strange.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I remember when I first got the rubber and pealed off the plastic protection sheet, I thought the rubber was going to be really tacky but was really disappointed."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Especially since it was a black rubber.I played with it for about an hour on my Instinct blade and then put it away.It is only just recently that I dug it out because it was one of the few black inverted rubbers I had to match my red 007.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,When I stuck it on again I but my finger on the rubber to see how tacky it was and again there was nothing.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,So I cleaned it just with water and started training with it.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Cleaned it a few more time and slowly I was noticing it was getting tackier and tackier.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Obviously it won't continue like that but now the sheet is nice and tacky, the way I imagined it to be like from the beginning."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,I would recommend the geospin tacky.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"(haha its the only inverted i actually use frequently)actually, to tell you the truth, im quite surprised when i saw on the review site and the threads about the geospin tacky which said that the sponge is quite hard."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"well to me, nothing can be further from the truth."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,i feel its soft.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,quite soft.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"actually, the softest inverted (out of 3  ) i have used.I think its a fairly slow rubber with very good control and spin (i use 2.2!!"
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,well i had no choice cuz the shop ran out of stock)even with such a thick sponge.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,smashing flat shots are easy and surprisingly accurate as well as fast.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"it pushes well close to the table and its easy to brush loop with.But the thing is, i use a very slow blade."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,so perhaps the blade compensated for the thick sponge.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,so i guess i would recommend that you use a thinner sponge for a normal blade.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"but even though my blade is very slow, the fact that a beginner like me can control it (at least i think i can  ) with such a thick sponge really says something about the control.well now i would like to chip in to the gains-tackiness-after-some-time-topic."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,i rubber cleaner to clean my bat after i use it and then i cover it with the sticky protection film.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"like another user here, i was very very very dissapointed when i just stuck it to my blade because i thought that it would be super tacky."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,like the types of rubber which can pick up balls and hold one upside down for five seconds type.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"but when i just opened it, the rubber barely lifted the ball up to 6 inches."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"but now, it hold the ball up for some time."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,perhaps this is because i use a rubber protection sheet?
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"All right, it looks like I'll be deciding between the Tackiness Chop and the Geospin."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Thanks all for your very helpful comments.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,One thing I'm still not sure about is which of the two provides a better contrast with OX long pips on the backhand.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Any insight into that question would be much appreciated.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,That's a tricky question TT.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Normally contrast is between a faster hitting/looping rubber on FH and pips on BH.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Contrasting chop on FH and BH with inverted and pips is going to be a lot less contrast I think as they will both produce underspin, just in different ways and reactions to the ball received."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"My gut feel stays with the Tackiness Chop, only because its a softer rubber and so with pips generally being harder the effect is likely to be different."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,Its going to ome down to your personal pref though really.
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"I'm garbage at chopping with inverted, but when I do, I get the best results with old style 729."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"That's not unexpected actually Rob, but it does get overlooked easily as an option."
171,5f6c3563220a4650ffffdc61,FH rubber for close/mid-distance chopping and attack?,"Straight 729 is fairly slow and very tacky in its own right, so in a thinner sponge it would make a very cheap inverted chopping option."

172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,But the loops and drives I was hitting were just as effective and just a tad slower.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,My hitting partner said he felt the pace pick up a little with the Tenergy which you'd hope for given the price diff lol.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"cheers for that reb, just got your PM about it aswell lol."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I might try transcend, but right away I have my doubts as im not sure how i'll play with tacky (yes, ive had spinsonic before but im not sure with SH) plus its a hard rubber, and im used to a med sponge"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Hi,mate,"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,If I would be you Tranced wouldnt be an option.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,I played with magna and is superb ruber with speed glue and to my ccompersation Roxon450 should be wery good optoon for you.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Why 1.8?
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Simpley beacuse in 1.8 you dont lose speed an power you just get more control and consistancy.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Regards wat ruber is spinier R450 or Tenergy05 I belive R450 is the one even do I play at the moment with T05 on f/h and R450 on B\H but tend to twidle and do opening loop with R450.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Hope this helps.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Btw stay away from traditional chinese rubers as without speed glue they just dont work.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Another option is new 729-08 rubber even is slower then glued Magna it could work for you.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Having played with Roxon 450 for a while until recently, I echo the remarks made both Speedplay & Purger, a very good rubber for doing just about everything well."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,I play a up to the table style similar to what you described but hit more than looping but IT suited this style.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,I only changed because I found something better with more firepower.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Go with 2mm if you are going to try it especially on the FH, don't compromise your ability to maximize your looping."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,cheers
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"cheers for the help guys, Ive actully made an order for a sheet of 2.0mm, now the wait for it to arive here begins"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"btw, thanks for the other advise, sadly, my max thickness is 2.0, ive always goes with 2 and anything thicker will cause me to adjust more then I would have to when getting a new rubber with 2, if that makes sence to you (ie: I turned down the chance to buy 007 someone was selling because it was 2.2, if it was 2, you'd bet i would of bought ti lol)"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,So is one color spinnier than the other in this?
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Purger as you have it on your BH I assume it is black?
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Mars did you have 2 or 2.2 on your hybrid when I tried it?
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"reb I think it comes down to the old saying of black is more tackier, even though I dont get many tacky rubbers, ive always stuck to that concept"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Reb I pretty much only ever use max thickness now, I have never really felt I have lost any control with the tensor rubbers but I like to push everything to the max with respect to speed."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,My thoughts on Roxon 450 are well documented but I'll reiterate here.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,I absolutely LOVE this rubber.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"My game is close / mid table looping, lots of spin on serve and also blocking with my pips."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I've tried a number of other rubbers, but the Roxon is always one I come back to."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I've had a lot of comments this season from players saying to me ""wow, I found that very difficult to play against"" and I say ""yeah, well that's the pips for you"" and they say ""no, not the red side, that black side was causing me more problems, you just get so much spin from it""."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I've also had a lot of very good players in my division struggle to get my spin serves and loops when I connect well, just because R450 gives me so much more spin than anything else that I've used."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,The biggest plus point though is that the sponge is fairly soft and I just get great control on the short game as well.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"So to sum up - It's great on spin, great for looping and has great touch and feel."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"OK if you're an out and out hitter, then it's probably not the rubber for you."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"However if you like to loop, play big spin serves and want great touch and feeling, then I cannot recommend it enough."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I've just put a sheet onto my slightly faster ALL+ blade and have dropped from 2.0mm to 1.8mm, so I'll let you know how they compare, but by all accounts, the 1.8mm version is the most popular"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Ok I had a match last night and it was the first time that I'd played with Roxon 450 with a 1.8mm sponge (I used to play with 2.0mm).
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,I have to say that I really like this rubber in 1.8mm.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"In terms of touch and feel, it was better and I felt much more comfortable moving the ball around."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,However the biggest difference I found came from blocking back my opponents shots.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,On a few occasions my opponent hit some very good shots which came down on my forehand side and I instinctively put the bat in the way and it cushioned back onto the table without any drama at all.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"In fact, I had to be careful as it felt so comfortable on the control that in some rallies, I became a little bit too relaxed and didn't try and kill the point with a big hit."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Hitting?
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Well I definitely managed to get more pace from the 2.0mm version as it had more of a natural spring to it, but the 1.8mm version is superb and suits my game better."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I'm more of a natural looper than a hitter and with the added control, I felt a lot more comfortable with getting my loops on."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Overall I like Roxon 450 in 1.8mm.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"It has a great natural feel to it, the control is superb, I love the way I can block with it and it still generates great levels of spin for looping and serving."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Does it have enough power for a straight kill though Chris?
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"hey chris, nice little review of the 1.8mm, but I think I made the right choice in buying 2.0, hopefully I get the rubber before next thursday"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Hmmm, well it's not as quick as the 2.0mm version so you really need to be over the ball and very positive to kill it, but yes, you can still get a straight kill, however it's not as easy and requires a good technique."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"As I tend to loop and side loop the ball more than flat hitting (I've never been a great flat hitter), this doesn't worry me."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,What I'd say though is this.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"The where the 1.8mm is better for the short game, close control, blocking and personally speaking, looping, the 2.0mm version is easier and better to produce straight kills and pace, but you do lose some of the control."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"From my personal point of view, I want to be able to produce good spin on serves and loops, but above all, I want to keep myself in the rally by being able to place the ball where I want it and also keep it going with good touch and control."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"For my game, I feel the 1.8mm version suits me better because it gives me this."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"However some might want more pace and for them, I'd recommend the 2.0mm version"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Having used the 1.8 Omega II I think I know where you are coming from.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,I do want more spin that the OII though.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,The R450 in 1.8 or 2 sounds good.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"well, the rubber came in the post today, which is great news, apart from the fact its monday and I dont play TT untill thursday"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,guess i'll have to try and get a session in on wednesday
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"well I got a knock up tonight, only played 2 people, but from what I was told, they both played vets for the county, one was #2 in the team, the other was #3. my luck I played the #2 first"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"so I start to knock up, and first hit with the R450 WOOOSH, went 2 metres over the guys head..... ok, this could take a bit."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"adjusting was hard, my timing was off with the rubber, but when i got it on, getting his one back was hard for me, then ofc it threw my timing off on the BH"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"so I played 6 games with him, and it was quite fun, he got me early, and then i managed to get a game against me, duno how."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"later on I managed to get some loops going which he did strugle with, last game we played I should of won but lost it 12-10, I just couldnt get my BH working, which is odd"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"so not flustered by my performance, I took on the #2, and the warmup was fun, he was a lefty but that didnt matter, playing the rallies were so much fun, and i could hear that ""ping"" you get with speed glue and SGE, I wouldnt say the fact he also had a SGE helped, or the speed helped, but I started to get the timing right, and when i was blocking, man, it can block."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"my worst part was a couple times I lost points which after I lost them i said to myself ""hey, dont loop it, with you cant do that shot with this rubber, block it""."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I didnt win any games, we must of played 5-6 games, i lost them and got between 6-8 points each game, im not used to playing chops that heavy that short, if tried to lift them over with the pips and struggled getting a good possition, and i got them over with the roxom but was bad placements"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"im looking foward to tomorrow and friday night, see if i can keep it up."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"real plus for me was the other county vet player (who oruginaly got me on megna and half-long) was there, we had a chat and he said he was interested to see how long the rubber and its effect will last, he might go back to magna because he cant find anything like it (he calls manga the spinniest rubber stiga made)."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Real boost for me was he asked if I played leage this season, when I said no, he was kinda shocked, guess I have to be in the league next season"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Skull,"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,You will find that the Roxon feels a bit...what's the word....springy to start with.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"When I put a new sheet on, I normally end up putting the ball of the table."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Give it a few games to bed in and settle down and you'll find that it gets even better!
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"yea I agree with that, all i was doing at first was looking at the rubber and saying ""this has a higher throw to magna?""."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I found it odd how although it felt like I was hitting the ball on the sides of the rubber, I wasnt."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"Because i had to clean it before I started it ment after the first game I had a nice look of the spots the ball hit and 95% (gestmate) were hit from the centre, about 5 were left of the centre (sugesting that when I went for chop serves I stroked them too early), and a couple odds around the sides aswell, so I was quite impressed"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"I found after having that knock up and getting into some rallies with the 2nd guy that I was starting to understand the rubber, I must admit sometimes I did step back a little, something I didnt do with manga, so it defently has a nice spring, but it just has made me worry what if it dies early, i'll be playing back a little now but later it wont have that spring and I wont expect it lol"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"all i worry about no is tonight, my mentor told me to stick with magna, so I wonder what he will say when he finds out I have roxon lol"
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,Skull even the most controlling mentor should understand someone wanting to discover things for themselves.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,If he has a problem with it just tell him you are broadening your horizons.
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"You can always go back to Magna as you know how you play with it, but if you never try anything else, you'll never know if you can even play with other stuff, letalone whether anything is better for you."
172,5f6c359d220a4650ffffdc82,Is Andro Roxon 450 for me??//first impressions,"dont worry reb, im more worried about him when I beat him tonight with it lmao"
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Nice comparative review Saltebor, but which Nimbus were you using?"
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,There are about 5 varieties I think.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Sound, Soft, Hard, Medium, Normal/Std."
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Normal
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,you should tune the hammond X it's not a speedglue replacement rubber.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,When tuned it's much better than nimbus and express one
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,...and which Joola Express were you using?
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,One or Two?
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,They are so different...
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I tried both.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Express one on fh and express two on bh.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Express two suits to bh perfectly.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Good control, speed and spin."
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Express One is a nasty weapon.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,You have to adjust your technical skills to perfect to control this rubber.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"If you technically correct, then it will fit your play."
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Excellent spin and speed.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Your opponents will have hard time to block your tops spin.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I have a problem to control this rubber.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Once I switched to Nimbus immediately I got huge relief in terms of control.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Nimbus has different characteristic for speed and spin and has tremendous short play and catapult effect.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I would try Express Two for BH and Nimbus VIP on FH next month.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Will see hot it goes.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,Please tell which blade you are using.
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Nimbus is easy to control, but only on stiff blades!"
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,"Tried it once on an OC and it was a desaster, no control at all!"
173,5f6c35ab220a4650ffffdc8a,Nimbus vs Joola Express One/Two vs HammondX,I use American Hinoki WRC - which has medium hardness.
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,Quelis will be crushed!
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,He will have to start thinking of a new rubber once he finishes the sheets he still has.
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,I didn't think Mars was a bad rubber either.
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"I may have got a dud sheet of Venus perhaps, but I thought Mars was a bit faster than Venus and a better feel."
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,Or maybe I just got too used to tesors by the time I tried Venus.
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"They may come up with better version and better quality,"
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,I hope it doesnt not effect other rubbers...
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,I will be detestated if they decide on stopping the neptune rubbers.
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"If so, i will be more than happy to buy all the stock"
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"wow, im quite suprised they have stoped the rubber, yin-he has started to become a bit more well known over here now that bribar stock their rubbers (on a side note, they call the brand ""milky way""......)"
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,I hope yin-he dont stop production of other rubbers of their because they are perfect rubbers (price wise) for people getting back into TT or starting TT
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"Well, life can be tough sometimes  ..."
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"OK seriously speaking, I have a good stock of Mars to keep on going when I return to TT again."
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,"And besides, I guess that the new Jupiter (released just a few months ago) is the substitute of Mars but without the oxidation problems that Haggisv mentioned above."
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,I'm sure that many people didn't like it because it didn't shine enough...
174,5f6c35af220a4650ffffdc8d,Galaxy/Yin-He Mars rubber discontinued,Q.-
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"ARWC believe me mate, you are not making a lot of posts!"
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,And that's what the forum is here for anyway.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"The Boost TC has just been given a review by Geko, and there was also a video review of it, which I have just reminded myself of as I haven't put that into the review index."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,I must dig it up.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Look in the index for them both soon.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"As for the Pryde, I don't know much about it."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Can't recall a review on it.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"I think Purger may have used it and not thought much of it, but I could be mistaken."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Thanks for that!
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,I have heard the usual mixed about both.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"It's so difficult as i spent so long decided on my comination recently (as you may remember) but i think i'm just improving a lot faster, and regaining my speed and the rubber isn't quite there."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"Having rooted around a bit and read several threads on the main tt forums, i think that maybe Tenergy would do."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"I can't seem to find any positive Pryde users, which is a shame as i've always liked yasaka."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Now for the choice between tenergys!
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Thanks Speedplay that's great.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Yeah i've just been reading that post before I made the initial one about tenergy.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"From reading it, it seems like tenergy 05 would suit me more but i'm not sure."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"There's a guy who plays at my club who tested the bryce, bryce fx and tenergy 05 recently but he plays Korean penhold so the rubber is tiny compared to my blade and his bat is so different it's not much use."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,He loves it though.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,The only thing i'm concerned about is it's durability.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"I mean i don't play a lot, but then again, having only been back into the sport since last october i'm already developing EJing habit, so the longer it lasts the better!"
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Any thoughts on that?
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"Tenergy is quite durable more than most tensors, so this might be a nice pick."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"By the way my game has improved 25% since i switched to Tenergy 05 a few months ago, when you get used to the high throw angle you will love it like most pro`s does."
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Ok thanks gentlemen.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,I think that i will go for it.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"I expect at least 3 months out of it, because i can't afford to buy another one!"
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Not after only recently buying the tackifire and before that buying mark v xs...i'm not earning enough to spend it on table tennis!
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Thanks again.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,3 months?
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,"If I only get 3 months from a rubber I'll get a balloon and stick it to the sponge and blow in some air and say ""now play with the wind up ya!"""
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,The amount of money spent on rubbers for every 3-4 months is a drop in the ocean compared to the money spent EJìng.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,Take it from me I was one of the worst infected just ask Slippery.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,i would have saved a few thousand the last 6 months if I only had replaced the rubbers which was worn out
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,what was the topic???
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,?
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,You know that's a very good point Speedy.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,I was very close to stopping (oops I mean slowing down ) EJing and just buying a second Cayman to try other rubbers on.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,The purger showed me this Enforce blade
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,At least I'm not EJing comp-wise now.
175,5f6c35b5220a4650ffffdc91,Boost TC or Pryde,I'm sticking with the Cayman for comp matches.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,It depends on what you are going to do with it.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Chop off the table?
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Block close?
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Loop?
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,I have used the 1.7 only.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,"I did like it but, if you are going to chop off the table don't think you will be able to get into a loop counter loop with someone."
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,You can't.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Not nearly fast enough.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Don't get me wrong.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,It will put away a loose ball but you won't be hitting it past someone with a powerloop.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,So figure out what you want and go from there.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Good luck.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,Chop chop and chop.
176,5f6c35d7220a4650ffffdca8,Tackiness Chop 1.1 or 1.3?,I've got some advice and I think I'm going for 1.1mm
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Great comparions purger!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Looks like Santa's been good to you this Christmas?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Yes, good comparative reviews among those rubbers  Some guys got all the luck being able to get whatever rubbers they feel like trying"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Cheers.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Well Im working so much overtime in past few months so little early presents from santa has come
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Thanks Purger...
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Looks like I'm sticking with Zeta... Like you said, I also find it pretty good for FH, excellent for BH."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I'm not forking out the difference in price for the 10% increase in speed.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,LOL  Rok look maybe 15-25% but as you said its fast inaf for B/H
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I try O3 E on B/H was great to but Zeta gives an litle extra control for spini serve return
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Thx mate,"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"@ purger how's zeta for hitting, smashing and blocking?"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,For hiting Omega3 asian is better but its ok with zeta to.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Smashing and blocking is great as well.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,how is the speed of zeta asian and o3 asian compared to mambo gp max?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E, Sunflex both Xiom are spinier O3 asian is around 30% faster and Zeta asian about 5% faster but control of Xiom rubbers is 30-40% greater than Mambo GP.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"thanks purger, I got my sheet of zeta max black today."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I hope to try it out soon.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E, Great looking forward to your opinion on Zeta
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E," From all Xiom rubbers,Roxon,Platin,Pride the Omega 3 Asian version has the closest speed glue feeling after is Omega 3 euro that is wat I feel others may have diferent opinion."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I would recomend Zeta asian version to you.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,sponge hardness 47.5 degree
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Bost TC is faster then Zeta heard from few players I played against.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Purger you haven't played with a Max Omega rubber have you?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Do you think it would still be as controllable, as Slippery won't use a thinner sponge IIRC."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I myself opted to go for the 1.8 sponge on O II to try it, as from what I understand it will be fast enough."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Of course if its not, I might be caught stepping up to O III, and then I'd perhaps go 2.0 sponge."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,The max sponges do tend to be a bit faster overall than the 2.0s.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,It's more noticeable in softer sponges.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I haven't tried O3E in 2.0, but max was fine, easy to control."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Ditto with O2A.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I've tried this in 2.0 and max.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I had trouble bottoming out either; I could have played happily with a 2.0.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,1.8?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I'm not so sure.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I would have suggested you go for the O3 (A or E?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"), as I feel it's slightly better overall (though there's really not much difference)."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,You'll adjust anyway.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Omega 3 Asian I have is MAX thickness
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,So how much faster is that than O3E?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,And what control is lost?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,A didnt loose any control just get more power for away looping actualy O3 asian is even less bouncy on pushes and short game.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Wat I did lose with max thicknes is litle bit of blade feel thats why i like 2mm.Asian version was only available in max.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Yes they are all build in speed glue efect offensive and defensive rubbers.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Max laverige is wery nice allaround offensive rubber and produces huge spin specialy on slow strokes,serves and pushes."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I have used O3E.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Sounds like I should like the O3A better.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"It's faster without losing control, and may gain control on short game."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Hard to believe that Boost TC is faster.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I tried Boost TP, which is supposed to be harder and faster than TC and I found it dead compared to JO Coppa Gold, a tensor that is probably similar to the Xiom ones reviewed here."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I was thinking the same but i have to try first to realy se if it is or not.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Zeta is pretty fast fels faster then Omega2 to me as well touch faster then roxon 450.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,That's the most minor thread hi-jack I've seen you do I think Slip!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,So you have finally given in to going for the T-8 huh?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Good to see!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,So did you get the S.Matiz?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,How was it?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Now this is a major thread hi-jack I know, but we could bring it back by asking how you think an Xiom rubber would go on it?"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,You two now wat happends to hi- jackers
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,@ Purger what qill be a suitable blade for Zeta?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,My current blade is gergely but it's a little too stiff my taste.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,What do you recommend?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I recomend DHS Hurricane King or DHS Hurricane Hao
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,As recommended for me to him!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I didnt try T-8
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Max Lavarage I have is 1 year old and here and there I stil play with for fun and has same spin and speed .Topsheet is not as shiny as new one but that doesnt afect performance.Here are some pics,"

177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"That was interesting,thanks Haggisv."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,One thing is that they compare rubbers on different blades so
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I try Omega 3 asian max on Hurrican King and Hurricane Hao and on HK is great on Hao felt terible.On Hurricane Hao Omega 3 Euro feels fantastic so I think it all comes to personal preference of individual player.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,In case of Boost TC and Zeta A if TC is more durable then TC is the real winer as guys said that was an a only slight difference bettwen the two rubbers.

177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Each blade should therefore suit rather than hinder the rubbers performance which wouldn't have been the case say, if in an extreme example, we'd tested both rubbers on the same really defensive blade."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I agree entirely when you say that it comes down to personal preference of a player.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,The Zeta and Andro is my match combination and I really like the Zeta (Asian sponge) for my style of play which is up to the table counter hitting and smashing.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"the funny thing is, the review says boost tc is better for hitting and blocking."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Yep it does.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,And both players doing the testing are better and far more experienced players than me so can get more out of the rubbers which is why I asked them to do the testing.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I only commented above on how I find the Zeta plays (not as a comparison to the Boost TC).
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Sorry if this came across differently.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Maybe if Santa had been kind and left me a sheet of Boost TC I would give it a try myself but he hasn't .
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"As it says at the start of the video, ability, style and blade will all affect how a rubber performs."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,We also say where ever possible you should try a rubber yourself too before you decide what to do.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"But that's not always possible, so the intention of the video was to at least give people the chance to see what the rubbers looked like and how the they played before they made their own mind up."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I think it's a great effort... People in forums generally understand that something that works for one, may not work for another..."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"But a even single review is a lot better than no review, so I'm real pleased with this review and it's quite comprehensive, and the opinion of experienced and seemingly unbiased players."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Hope to see more reviews like this!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"You make it sound like, i'm a counterhitter so I prefer Zeta."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,And you talk about personal preference while the review says boost tc is better for hitting and blocking.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,That doesn't make much sense to me.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,That's why I said it was funny SPEEDPLAY!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Debater is NOT either one of the people in the video doing the review, he's simply expressing his personal view as well... that's where the confusion came in I think"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,No but I think Debater is the narrator of the video.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Is that correct debater?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"He is involved in some way Haggisv, because he asked the two guys in the vid to do the testing, as he states above."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"The video was interesting, although it seemed to favour heavily toward boost tc, when it seemed marginal actually."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,(Could it be bias because of the Stiga shirts?)
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,LOL.

177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I filmed, edited and narrated the video."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I checked with the two players that they were happy with it before I posted it on Youtube.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,The original intention was to use playing footage interspersed with the players views when I interviewed them at the end of the night.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Unfortunately the sound from the other players using the hall drowned out the interviews to the extent I could only salvage their summaries at the end when everything had quietened down.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,A learning curve for me.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"My narration was based on what the players had said in the interview footage I couldn't use.RebornTTEvnglistYes, again you are right."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,There was very little difference between the rubbers and both performed well but I asked the players to chose one in each category.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"At the end we do say there was very little between them and Tony does talk briefly about the blades and how that could have affected the performance of the rubber.Just to clarify one last thing, speedplay said:"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"My next reply started ""Yep it does""."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Unfortunately speedplay had replied quicker to sunflex than I had and I didn't realise it.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"The ""Yep it does"" refers to sunflex's comment about what I had put sounding strange."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I now appreciate the need for using ""quotes"" and greater care in posts"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I'm sorry, it was not my intention to confuse people and I am very aware this is purgers thread about Xiom rubbers not the review."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Xiom has different generations as well.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"I think the latest one is the Tensor Bios, which includes the Omega 1-3 (redone) & Zeta."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Also soon to come out.... Omega 4....
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"OK, I didn't know about O4."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Now the EJ monster is stirring heavily again!
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Slip, Xiom 3, pre Aug 2008 was a non-glue effect rubber that was made specifically for SG until the ban."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"As Rok says, they re-did it with SG effect sponge after the ban."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"And from what Purger says, its a beast!"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,So what the heck is O4 gonna be like?
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"And more importantly, will its price be more then Tenergy"
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,I tried my sheet of Zeta Asian Max on a Clipper WRB for the first time today.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,It's and excellent looping rubber with very good feel and extreme spin.
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,"Counters and blocks are fine, a little bouncy though."
177,5f6c35dc220a4650ffffdcaa,Comparison of Xiom Rubbers O3 E&A/Zeta A/O2 E,Shortgame and serves are fine.
178,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,Thats not a hard-and-fast rule.
178,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,"I personally have 729 God Favored SST, and it works wonder on my Septear."
178,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,I'd give LKT rapid power or speed a shot.
178,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,"Well, last time I tried both of them, I felt T05 was slightly harder, faster and spinnier but with less dwell."
178,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,It also threw a lot higher than Bryce Speed did.
178,5f6c35de220a4650ffffdcac,Bryce Speed VS Tenergy 05 ? Or other comparisons with T05?,I didn't try it on a hinoki blade though...

179,5f6c35ff220a4650ffffdcbb,Donic Sonex Formula X / XF,"Thanx, other opinions ?"
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I've used Hammond and Optimum MP (it was a while ago so forgive me if I'm a bit vague) and Hammond definitely has a softer feel and is slightly faster.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"I found Hammond a much more controllable and predictable looping rubber, although both are capable of generating a lot of spin on loops."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,OMP has a much grippier topsheet and is better for serving but neither is great.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Hammond is less susceptible to incoming spin and easier to return serve with.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Both are fairly good for blocking and poor for pushing.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Which Hammond is it that you're using?
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I used to use the Pro Alpha and thought it was pretty good.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I tried all the Hammond rubbers and I thought the Pro A was the best.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"I got more spin and with the right blade, it is as fast as anybody needs."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"This was for an attacking, countering type game."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I could still switch back to it today with no problem.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I also found it to be a very durable rubber.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"Hmmm, maybe as I look to upgrade the speed on my forehand I should consider returning to the Hammond Pro Alpha."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"Now, I'll have to dig through my cache of equipment to see if I have a spare sitting around from a few years ago..."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I had the Hammond X on a killerspin blade and loved it.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"I was a little fast for me, and not spinny enough to setup a proper kill shot."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Thanks for all the great info.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I keep hearing that OMP has a hard sponge and that producing spin can sometimes be a problem.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Can the same be said for Mendo MP?
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I would sacrifice some speed to get a little more spin with reg MP.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Also does Yasaka V Stage have the same hard sponge and lesser grip tendencies as well?
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Also that HPA is as good or better than reg Hammond.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,I think it may produce a little more spin but is somewhat slower than reg Hammond.
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Hammond X may be somehwere in between?
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,Thanks again!
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"If it was just a comparision between the three, Hammond is the angry older brother, Hammond pro A is the sensitive type, and Hammond X is the career orientated sucessful sun."
180,5f6c360f220a4650ffffdcc6,Optimum MP or Hammond?,"Hammond X is neither the fastest or spinniest, but is faster then the A but spinnier then the Hammond."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Neos Tacky is an excellent BH rubber for those who like mild tackiness.Sort of Euro/Chinese hybrid.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"It is quick(for a tacky one),very light, medium hard."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"Block is perfect, opening loops are easy, push is deadly, serve is spinny.Juic Spin Spiel Ultima is quite similar."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Gambler Aces can be a cheaper alternative(much tackier though)
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,my red sheet of gambler aces was non-tacky as cloth.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"i think another good option could be pailo rubbers, cj8000 biotech or macro era."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"Actually on a side note, some Chinese companies have weird QC, like I had a really tacky sheet of Geospin tacky, but the next sheet was like sriver grippy."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,@OP: what blade are you currently using?
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"If the blade is fast enough for varied anti play, then you can always try good old H3 or 729 Super FX, since they chop very well, helping a twiddling game, and also kicks quite a bit on attacking strokes."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,thanks for that info.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,I am tempted towards the neos tacky now.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,I just don't want to blow good money on a rubber that turns out to be bad.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,I believe the sponge is medium?
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,How is the control/touch on short pushes and chopping?
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,I had thought about the juic actually...i just don't know what my options are for a high quality rubber.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Try one of the Japan sponged 729 variants.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,14USD per sheet is my speed.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"Boost TC is an excellent rubber, both FH and BH."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,It's got a pretty low throw and is very grippy.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"It's not the right FH rubber for me, so i'm using it for my BH."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,It's great for short controlled flips aswell as loops both close/mid/away from the table.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,What can i say.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"Give it a go, i like it, many others do."
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Alot of 2nd division players in my club use it too.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Thanks for that.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,That sounds very positive.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,I liked the idea of the soft sponge.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,If it's grippy then that's good as that's important to me.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Had some good feedback about neos tacky though...decisions decisions!
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,I'd look at 729 or other china rubbers first.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,Their characteristics change dramatically depending on the sponge its on.
181,5f6c361b220a4650ffffdccd,NEOS TACKY or BOOST TC or what?,"For instance, I'd love H2 top over MRS. At about 14 bucks a sheet, you can try 4 different variants of it for the price of one boost Tc."
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"Deb, I haven't used Tenergy but I'd say the principals are the same."
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I think generally a thinner sponge would be better for a flick for the extra control you get and the less catapulting that occurs to send the ball off beyond where you intended.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"However, I would say the more important thing is having the correct technique and blade angle for the shot and for the rubber and sponge you are using."
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"So overall, I think sponge thickness is not as important as getting the shot right."
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I would recommend 1.9 in some other rubber.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,The Tenergy is Very Hard and does not work well with very hard stiff blades.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I myself use Platin on my Bh because the Tenergy is to hard and 2 sheets of Tenergy will be too heavy.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"Yes I think the sponge does not matter so much for the flick, as it's a low impact shot...so I'd choose 1.9mm for better control."
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,thanks for the feedback ... i used to think spinny topsheet rubbers are good for flick... but i read some post where silver mention less spinny rubbers are better for flick.. confusing.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,anyway i ordered xiom zeta only reason being its $30 and available in US.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,till it arrives... i will let my ee2 work on the 729 reactor sponge.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"Maybe he said that in the sense that not too spinny sheets will help on controlling the service spin, especially if you flick without a lot of spin."

183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I find flicks from close to the net one of the harder shots cos I don't have the reach to really control the stroke well.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,Anybody have this problem?

183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,The backhand flick/loop is my longtime favorite shot and my main offensive weapon.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"Because this shot has no backswing or other telltale, when I execute it properly -- particularly on a short ball or unsuspecting serve -- it's usually behind my opponent before they have a chance to even begin moving their paddle."
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I recently bought Tihbar Nimbus Soft for a med fast 9-ply homemade blade that I use.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,Paddle Palace convinced me that I didn't want max sponge for my BH so I got the second thickest for BH (in black) and max on the FH (in red).

183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,The thinner sponge bottomed out easily and often went long.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,The max sponge never bottomed out and would take far shorter paths to the table.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I was surprised that so little difference in sponge thickness could make such a difference.
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,If you brush loop your flick shots as I sometimes do then sponge thickness isn't nearly as critical (then it's all about keeping your topsheet clean).
183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,"But if you drive into the ball I think you'll want all the thick, soft sponge you can get."

183,5f6c362e220a4650ffffdcd9,which is better for flicks (bh)? tenergy 1.9 or 2.1?,I'm ordering my own sheet soon.. in 1.9 for my bh.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,I have not tried that rubber so I can't comment...
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,But I can suggest that the soft sponged Tensors tend to have the greatest speed-glue click...
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Spin with slow strokes(serv - push): tenergy> boost series> tensors
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Spin with fast strokes (loop) tenergy> boost series = tensors
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Speed: tenergy> tensors > boost series
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,click sound: tensors> boost series > tenergy
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Boost Series rubbers are very similar to tensors.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,But they are not that springy-tensioned as tensors.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Serving and pushing is a bit better.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Blocking is safer.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,But boost tp & tc are flat trajectory rubbers so they are not good for backhand.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,But they are decent rubbers for forehand.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,If you think tenergy is too heavy and too expensive than you can go with the boost series...
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Nice summary Tsu.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,One thing to add; Boost rubbers are more durable than Tensors.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,yes I hear they are VERY soft rubbers.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,What exactly are the strengths if this rubber?
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Thkz
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,It makes no sense to generalize about tensors.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,They come in a very wide range.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"For example, F3 Big Slam and Jo Gold could not possibly be more different."
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Even JO Gold and JO Silver play differently and tend to suit different kinds of players.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"Moreover, the playing characteristics of any rubber depend a lot on what blade you use it on."
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"And of course whether or not it is ""better"" for you depends on how you play (and often how well)."
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,So a rating system on any one things that says something like Tenergy > Boost > tensors is pretty questionable.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,It is like comparing Cherrys to oranges to vertebrates.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"Even as to the question of durability, there is quite a bit of difference among tensors."
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"Baal, couldn't agree more.I second and triple your opinion"
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,yes I hear they are VERY soft rubbers.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,What exactly are the strengths if this rubber?
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Thkz
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"Sorry, can't help, nobody at my club has tried it."
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,TP has a medium sponge (Sriver EL maybe Magna) while TC has a soft sponge (something like Coppa Silver).
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,I may generalize that Boost series are more durable than tensors (used many tensors including some latest gen.).
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Boost series are less bouncy.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,TP has nice topsheet grip whereas TC is an absolute mechanical spin rubber.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Many tensors have better topsheet grip.
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,Both are low throw (TP was lower as far as I remember).
185,5f6c3645220a4650ffffdce8,stiga boost tc/tp?,"Both are light, TC being very light."
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,forgeot to mention.. i don't loop much away from table with backhand

186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,I think your looking for a chinese rubber.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,Most tensors are too soft for making good underspin.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,I would Recommend Globe 999 or Geospin tacky.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,from RITC.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,The problem with tensors is that they are way to springy and therefore you cannot generate enough underspin.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,You see the same problem when returning serves with tensors the ball jumps instead of sways away from the rubber.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,I myself have switched from soft tensor rubbers to hars tensor rubbers.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,I have switched from silver to Tenergy in FH and Platin in BH.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,Tenergy is on the other hand very spinny both extremely hard and fast and therefore it might be impossible to control as a chopper.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,They do only sell Tenergy to very good players since it is hard to control this hard rubber in the bh.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,Platin is also medium hard and also very fast it will be way to fast to control in the bh for chopping - that`s why you could not get any soin from it the contact time is very short for this rubber.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,Both these rubbers are attackers rubbers not choppers.
186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,What do you play at the moment ?

186,5f6c3650220a4650ffffdced,BEST TENSOR / GLUE EFFECT RUBBER FOR SPINNY PUSHES AND CHOPS,For chopping you need a hard rubber with low dynamics.

188,5f6c366e220a4650ffffdd02,Butterfly B/h,Sriver FX is a pretty soft and spinny rubber.
188,5f6c366e220a4650ffffdd02,Butterfly B/h,"If you need to have something about as soft as Sriver is, but you want more span you will probably have to go with something that has a tacky top sheet."

188,5f6c366e220a4650ffffdd02,Butterfly B/h,depends on whether you like low throw or high throw rubber..
188,5f6c366e220a4650ffffdd02,Butterfly B/h,i assume no one likes hard uncontrollable rubber for b/h
188,5f6c366e220a4650ffffdd02,Butterfly B/h,"after lot ot trial and error i am using tackifire 2000 topsheet on 729 reactor sponge .... this is a 10usd set-up from zeropong, but plays superb for controlled flips, chops, close or mid distance loops (i use fast blade) .."
188,5f6c366e220a4650ffffdd02,Butterfly B/h,and funniest thing is... i use 65 dollar tenergy on f/h; but the backhand gives me pretty much same dwell time .. and control for close to table shots.

189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Venus has similarities, and is certainly more lively unglued, but I think part of the kick is due to the hard sponge and tacky surface, which really needs glue to make it controllable IMO."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,hrm
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"I'm winding down from my ""normal"" rubber adventure and am thinking of going back to h2, h3 or 999nat"
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Maybe even a skyline...
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"As you know the H2/H3 will always suffer from inconsistancies from one rubber to another, so if you change regularly (as you do), this can take an adjustment every time..."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"The blue, #19 and #21 seem more consistant."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"The 999 Nat seems quite consistant, and you know how I like this one"
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,The #19 sponges didn't really do anything for me.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Too soft, less spin, didn't have that hard sponged cork feel that the blue sponge and 999 nats gave me."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Didn't really feel ""right"", especially with that sticky topsheet."

189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Have you tried the #21 sponge?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Maybe i'll go back to the 999 nat
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"No, no need to try the #21 sponge, it's blue so it must be good."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,wow!
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,hahahhaa... so anything blue is good...
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,but hey.. the #21 sponge you are selling is orange and not blue
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"The black rubber has the blue sponge (looks like we've run out  ), the red has orange sponge."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,what to use....

189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,nope.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Care to donate?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...," I'm a nice guy, we'll have to wait for the Site Admin to go back to work for that."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Which one do you want to try first?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Try Reactor Thunder (looks like it has the Green sponge from Joola Air), a 999 Topsheet on Quattro sponge , Stiga Boost or tune your Skyline/Hurricane and hope the ENEZ doesn't detect it."

189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"yep, tried it a while back."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Still have my sheet around somewhere...
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I take it out and hit with it occasionally.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"You're not saying it's a clone of H2 because it's not even close to H2  It plays more like H3, but the nano sponge is softer - I guess it's a lot closer to H3 #19."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Try the Globe Price Liqin.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I have used this for the last 2 weeks now and am very happy with it.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"As you can see in my sig I normally use H2 commercial, but the inconsistencies between batches was annoying me."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"I am going to write a review on it soon but in a nut shell it is just as spinny as H2, has more feel and is slightly faster."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,The throw is maybe a little higher.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"The topsheet is less tacky but the sponge is softer so you still get just as much spin, with more dwell time."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Mid range brush loops are amazingly spinny.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"not just the sponge, but the topsheet is softer than H3 too."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Silver are you saying out of all the tensors you've tried there is nothing?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Yep, thinner too.Unlike Hurricane 2, which has a massively thick topsheet - like bryce."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Tensors are fine, but they've got nothing quite like a glued up H2 ."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Tensors are my constant backhand rubber.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Sometimes forehand
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,bleh.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Used T05 last night.

189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Lost one because I couldn't control the ball in loop-loop rallies, won the other because I could kill the ball past the guy due to the slower game (lp blocker, still using scalpel  )"
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Haggisv, do you have any TG3 #21 black in anymore?"
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Is the #21 sponge harder than the #19?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I wonder what wang liqin is using...
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,H2 no19?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,his speed is still amazing... but his spin has improved quite a lot
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I doubt it.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,my H2#19 is definitely less spinny.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,The sponge is absorbing a lot of the spin potential.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,What hardness did u use?
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,This may affect...
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I recently tried a palio rubber with sticky topsheet.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,It is so soft that it feels like 32 hardness but hey I'm so surprised at the speed/bounce and spin it could generate.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Now I'm totally convinced that tacky topsheet can work with soft sponge provided that the rebounce/elasticity is there.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,mmm
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,dunno.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Whatever Haggisv has.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I'm sure whatever WLQ is using is much harder than what I tried anyway.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"Yes #21 is harder than #19, but seems softer than standard blue sponge..."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,bleh.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I just reviewed my old notes when I tried TG3.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,"""Dead as a doornail""."
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I don't think the #21 sponge will do that much for it.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Maybe I'll just go back to good old 999nat.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,I hate waiting for you to come back from holidays
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,LOL!
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Looks like things will get a little crazy when we get back as well...
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Surely as I'm planning on doing something different when you get back into the shop.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,It really depends on the hardness you got.
189,5f6c3675220a4650ffffdd06,Something like Hurricane 2's throw/kick...,Both have hardness versions from 35 to 38 (I remember one guy who is selling in a forum has all the different hardness versions).

190,5f6c368a220a4650ffffdd14,1.5mm or 2mm rubber?,"Well as for thickness it's entirely up to you.... 1.5mm is great for a defensive type approach, so chopping and blocking."
190,5f6c368a220a4650ffffdd14,1.5mm or 2mm rubber?,The 2mm will give you better attacking power through the bigger dwell time for top spin shots.

193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I know that...but I'm asking people of the forum whether I should get a 1.9 sponge or a 2.1 sponge...
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Just get the 2.1.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Okay thanks
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Get the 2.1mm
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,With Sriver L in 1.9 you can chop like hell .
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I don't know if you are able to do this with 2.1.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I would be interested to know the reason.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Can you please explain it to me ?
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,"For looping 1.9mm is barely enough, you don't want the already soft sponge to bottom out too easily.... the EL should still be quite controllable in 2.1mm... only if you play a more defensive style game or you're more of a beginner and don't hit the ball that hard, the 1.9mm might be better."
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I see the Sriver EL goes right down to 1.3mm.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,When would one want to use such a thin sponge?
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Cheers.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Usually classic defenders dont go any thicker than 1.5mm/1.8mm.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,But I have delved into the thinner sponges before and I did have a real hard time doing anything else besides chopping.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Thanks for all your comments
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,By the way I was going to use Sriver EL for my RPB; just letting you know!
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,EL without glue really isn't that soft...
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Hmmm...that is interesting.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I am getting a piece to try it out for my BH.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Want to see if I can rpb block/loop with it

193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,"Yea same, I'm using this for RPB loop/block"
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,"You know, I find that interesting as the non-gluers here prefer FX, and the gluers like regular Sriver."
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,No one likes the EL.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I like EL...
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,I prefer EL to Sriver both unglued...
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,"I find the regular Sriver too hard for my liking, and I don't glue."
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,So I would prefer EL.
193,5f6c36a0220a4650ffffdd23,Butterfly rubbers - 1.9 or 2.1?,Thanks for your comments!
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Ok!
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,How much difference are there between Couga and Nanocannon in speed?
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,I have interchanged Couga and JO Silver (both 2mm) on the backhand of my TSP Reflex 50 several times.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,"I prefer the Couga for smooth control (would you believe), and receiving serves, but the Silver for punch and higher throw."
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Both can be quite spinny.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,I have had (unglued) Couga/s for some time (also on Wavestones) but they have never felt that fast to me.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,"In contrast, the Silver's performance has been more spirited overall and I currently have it on the both sides."
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Ok!
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,I talked to some guys in my club and called the swedish japsko supplier.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,After much hesitation I made up my mind and ordered a JUIC Couga (max).
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,I just hope its grippy enough for my loops and style of play...
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Compared to your Chineser rubber (in your sig) it will require some adjustment in stroke to get the spin...
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Ok!
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,If Couga plays like ordinary non-tacky rubbers there wont take that long for me to adjust because I changed to my current setup 2-3 weeks ago.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Before that I´ve always been playing with non-tacky rubbers.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,Yes it's non-tacky so it will play like that.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,It also has a much lower throw.
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,"Couga is very fast (and so litle dwell time), but also slippery without spinmax..."
194,5f6c36ac220a4650ffffdd2a,Speed of JUIC Couga/Nanocannon?,"Nanocannon is not slippery but because of nanosponge has also litle dwell time, but the surface is spinny...you have to make loops almost like with chinese rubers, but it has very fast flat shots"
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,They're similar but different.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,Both are fast with average control and average spin.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,The MP is quite a bit lighter but I'd say the M2 is more durable.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,The M2 also has more firepower further back from the table whereas the MP is better for close to the table and mid-distance play.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,I really like the M2 on my hinoki blade.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,I don't understand why paddle palace gives it such a low spin rating because it is quite spinny to me.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,The sponge is firm but the topsheet is soft.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,I have also tried Mark V and it feels harder and slower and less spinny.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,I don't know if I got an old stock of Mark V because supposedly it should be softer than M2.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,This is on the same blade (K-4).
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,I have not tried Mendo MP.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,Warning: some people have quite strong feelings of dislike for the M2.
195,5f6c36bb220a4650ffffdd34,Mark V M2 or Mendo MP?,Don't blame me if you find you hate it too.

196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"So, which one are you?"
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,The guy with the hat or the other one?
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,Or perhaps the one who had drunk too many menergy?
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,1.
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"Yes, mostly in the short game."
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,The topsheet feels like a high grip (and harder) Bryce Speed topsheet.
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,2.
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,The Tenergy *should* feel softer and springier from midrange.
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"That being said, I haven't used Bryce Hard unglued."
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,3.
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"Yes, Tenergy has a fast bounce time."
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,I was having issues with it at first as it's so bouncy.
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,"Silver,"
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,What were your issues with it?
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,Looping and hitting the table?
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,Short game?
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,Return of serve?
196,5f6c36c9220a4650ffffdd3e,Tenergy vs Bryce/Hard,Everything?
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Welcome to the forum RBTT.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I could swear your name seems familiar but I just can't put my finger on it
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Sorry, I haven't used the rubbers you mentioned."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"There has been reviews of the Hammond rubbers, not sure about the J.O Platinum."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Have you tried doing a search for them here?
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I have read some reviews of the Hammonds but the only one for the Platinum is for the soft version and I am interested more in the regular version.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I was hoping for a direct comparison from someone who has used both of these.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I am looking to ordering some new rubber for a new blade { Gambler Black Diamond ST } but just want to know if I should stick with my Hammond or go with Hammond X or the Platinum Regular.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I am also hesitant with the Platinum as I have not always had the best of luck { if its German made? }
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,with the durability factor of those.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,So far I that is not an issue with my Hammond.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I also may be interested in the Optimum MP and wonder how that rubber compares with the previously mentioned rubbers.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The reg MP I have used before is probably the most durable rubber/topsheet I have ever used.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks for the kind response!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I used regular Hammond and the topsheet had very little grip, and I've tried JO Silver, which was pretty spinny."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I presume JO Silver is at least fairly similar to Platinum, and it's not hard to find inverted more spinny than regular Hammond anyways."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Dunno about Hammond X, but a number of people here have used it."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Wow that was quick!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I hope I get more great responses on this.......  For me I guess it gave me sufficient spin but I have not tried the new J.O.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,sheets so I would be happy with more spin and comparable speed { Hammond to me is pretty fast }
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I have used Hammond Alpha and Hammond X.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Both are pretty fast.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"When it comes to how spinny they are, I think it has to do with playing style to a degree."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum," Neither one will compete with a sticky rubber on brush loops but when driving, both are very spinny to me as evidenced by the blade angle required to block loop drives by them."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum," People judge spin some by the arc given when looping but,,,if you were to fire a fast bullet and a slow bullet parrallel to the ground, both would hit at the same time."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The fast bullet traveled further though so the arc is flatter.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum, I think the same applies to rubber spin.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The fastest rubbers have a flatter trajectory even though they may have put just as much spin on the ball as a slower rubber.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum," I also think that is why Hammond type rubbers block so well, they need a hard hit to ""get a hold"" on the ball and ignore some of the spin when blocking."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum, Speed glueing obviously can change this but I don't speed glue.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,platin is faster and spinnier than hammond x unglued.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,heavily glued hammond X is much faster and spinnier than platin.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks again for the good posts.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The trajectory issue with fast rubbers and its relation to spin was interesting and true.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I also do not glue so I am sort of leaning towards the Platinum right now.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Just hope its durability holds up........
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Anyone that uses Optimum MP is welcome to give me some inside info how it compares to Platinum or the Hammond series too?
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks!!!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,This site is awesome....
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Interesting speed comment about the Opt.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,MP!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I wonder how its spin compares to Platinum as some say Platinum has great spin properties?
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,@ speedplay no unglued it's not.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,with glue optimum MP is faster and spinnier than platinum but not more than hammond X.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Good points.... Maybe what I meant to say is { since I do not glue} is what tensor/ built in glue effect rubber has the best speed /spin qualities { unglued of course } Or Optimum MP/ Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Platinum { reg} all unglued.......
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Sorry if this is redundant.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Hookshot makes a good point about having to dig the ball into the rubber to get the best spin with Hammond and the X Mutant.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Playing styles and stroke types are also so important.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"With Hammond, you are pretty much a hitter or strong loop driver to get in the zone."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"With Hammond X, you get a few more tricks for free."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The blocking is natural.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,It is so under-rated... the ability to stay in the point and finish on your terms.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,X is so good at that while having all the sexy properties an offensive player wants.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Speedplay makes a neat point about MP.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I have only played aginst a hitter who used this rubber and switched to regular Hammond.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,(Jasna Reed might have infuenced this) This guy could hit all day long with MP on a Tube Aluminum.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,This experience makes me think MP is in the same category as Hammond - a driver's dream rubber.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"As for spin, I have no way to know."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"With each either Hammond or MP, his shots were smokin'."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"You will have to try them out for yourself, hopefully, using others who have the stuff you want to try."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"My overblown and fluffed up reviews don't count for much towards one deciding on the right rubber, except maybe for a small giggle."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"If you are a hitter with an OFF blade, any of those rubber can suit you just fine."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I moved away from the fine Nittaku line-up because of simple economic and EJ reasons.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,My vote goes to Joola Tango.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Its magical stuff.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The crack that it makes off the HK and the speed that it produces just blows people away when I get onto them!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Hmm, I could have swore I've compared Sriver EL vs. JO Platin..."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I guess the only input I could give is that JO Platin is good for loop driving, and somewhat average for brush looping."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I agree that spin can't be completely judged by the arc of the ball, however the part about the bullet doesn't translate to table tennis."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Bullets have screwball spin so they basically travel straight independent of spin and speed.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Looped table tennis balls travel with topspin, and the flight of the ball varies depending on both the spin and the speed."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"The faster the ball, the more downward force is applied by the air above the spinning ball."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,If i recall correctly it's a velocity-squared relation so a 60mph loop experiences four times as much downforce as a 30mph loop.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The faster loop will hit the ground before the slower loop.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Though ideally you'd want the loop to hit the table, not the ground, and determining whether it's advantageous to hit harder to get more arc is much too complicated to figure in any given situation."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Instincts and your practice partner's observations work a lot better.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I was hitting with someone who was using some tensor stuff, and they were really consistent looping with it in practice (personally i think the control on the stuff is awful)."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Unfortunately their loops had nice arc and hit the table not because of great spin or control, but rather because the loops were all really really slow."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Sounds like from what I have read that there is not really a significant difference between Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Platinum/ Optimum MP.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I think if I had to choose right now it would be betwen the Platinum and the Optimum MP.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I already have a setup with the Hammond on it and I do not feel that the Hammond X is that much different.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Right now I feel that even though the Platinum may be somewhat spinnier that the Opt.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,MP is not far behind and it is as fast if not a little faster.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I also loved the durability of regular MP topsheet and the feel it gave me.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Reg MP was pretty fast for me so the nano sponge for Opt.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,MP must make it a real rocket!!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Thanks again for all your great advice!
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I agree there is more downforce on a faster ball but you are leaving out the increased momentum of the ball.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"If what you say is correct, a ball looped hard would have a sharper arc than a slow ball."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I think there are to many factors for us to solve it here.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I know if you put a rubber on a slow blade and loop one, it has a sharper arc than if you put it on a fast blade."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I doubt if the amount of spin is much different while the arc is very different.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The bullet anolagy was the only one I could think of to try and give an idea about how spin/speed relate.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The blade angle required to block a loop tells alot about how much spin is on a ball.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Like it was mentioned, another person receiving the ball will have a good idea how much spin was really on the ball."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Yes a faster ball has higher momentum, but the momentum is horizontal so it's irrelevant when looking at how quickly the ball will drop."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Given two balls with equal rpms and different speeds, the faster ball definitely has a sharper arc, as the force of air resulting from spin is more than gravity."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,(Whether the sharper arc is enough to overcome the fact that it spends less time over the table is unknown.)
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Yeah, the person receiving the ball ought to have a good idea of how much spin is really on the ball."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,However that person also needs to understand how their racket reacts to spin.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,A more closed racket does not mean the ball has more spin and speed; a lot of times a faster ball with equal spin requires a more open racket.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"Yes intuitively I'd say you're right, but it's hard to prove since we have no way of imparting equal spin at different speeds."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I also think faster loops often carry less spin, as you tend to put more energy into speed instead of spinning the ball... a lot of exceptions to this of course..."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,"I've used Hammond, Hammond X and Optimum MP, all not speed glued."
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,They are all fast rubbers.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,For spin
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Hammond X > OMP > Hammond
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,For speed probably
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Hammond > OMP > Hammond X
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,The main difference I found in use was that OMP [b]felt[/b] much harder than the Hammonds and I ended up stopping using it for that reason.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I do not know Hammond or Hammond X - but I can tell that regular Platin os much faster that both JO silver and gold.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I use it on my FH and cant believe the speed i get.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,I wonder if anyone have any experience with it in the soft version.
199,5f6c36e6220a4650ffffdd50,Hammond/ Hammond X/ J.O. Platinum,Speedy

200,5f6c36f1220a4650ffffdd58,juic 999 elite nano/999 elite nano tuned vs h3 classic or 19,Yes that sounds about right.
200,5f6c36f1220a4650ffffdd58,juic 999 elite nano/999 elite nano tuned vs h3 classic or 19,"The H3 would probably have a higher top-speed, but you need to put a lot more effort into it to generate it, unless you really pour on the glue."

201,5f6c36fe220a4650ffffdd5f,Chinese Rubber Closest to Bryce/ Hammond/ Optimum MP?,They still lack the top end speed of rubbers like Bryce.
201,5f6c36fe220a4650ffffdd5f,Chinese Rubber Closest to Bryce/ Hammond/ Optimum MP?,Are people still saying that...
201,5f6c36fe220a4650ffffdd5f,Chinese Rubber Closest to Bryce/ Hammond/ Optimum MP?,Inspirit is absolutely nothing like bryce...
201,5f6c36fe220a4650ffffdd5f,Chinese Rubber Closest to Bryce/ Hammond/ Optimum MP?,"It's not, but it's the most distinctly Euro/Jap style Chinese rubber, and it gets good speed."
201,5f6c36fe220a4650ffffdd5f,Chinese Rubber Closest to Bryce/ Hammond/ Optimum MP?,That's as close as you're going to get.

204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Dawei Inspirit (Quattro)
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Yeap.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,But Sriver's spin capability is unmatched.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,And Inspirit is heavier
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Hasn't this question been asked many times before and the ultimate answer is that there really isn't anything like Sriver but cheaper?
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,yep.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,inspirit quattro is a hell of a lot heavier.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,the sheet I have is 0.27gpcm2.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,sriver is around 0.21 to .22
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Come here.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,You can get Sriver cheaper... Mucho mucho cheaper...
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Ekrips and Ekrips soft perhaps ?
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,?
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Thx
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,And what do you think about my idea about LKT rubbers?
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,May they be a good (and light) replacement?
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Torrent and Gold Dragon both feel pretty different from Sriver.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"The new Inspirit Quattro Ultralight is supposed to be a good deal lighter than regular Inspirit Quattro, so that might be worth a try."
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"Still, nothing is quite like Sriver."
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,I thought about LKT XT (normal Version).
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"Of course its softer than Sriver, but else it could feel the same or not?"
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"Never tried that rubber, just thought"
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,so after reading about it.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"I'm not sure how a softer, slower and tackier rubber could feel like Sriver."
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"I wouldn't think so, but I've never tried LKT XT before."
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"Oh sorry, i meant XT not XP."
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"XT is close to Sriver , but is tacky and very soft, maybe more like Sriver FX"
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"Hmm i am buying these rubbers for a beginner, who plays sriver EL 1,9mm"
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"on both sides at the moment, so XP in 2,0 or thicker may fit?"
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,Should be as fast as his Sriver but spinnier with a thicker sponge.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,These rubbers are ok .
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,I played with sriver L 1.9 on a side and XP 2.0 on another side of the racket.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,My daughter plays with Sriver L 1.9 + XT 2.0 .
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,In thicker (2.2mm) version I think are even better.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,"Thx, sounds good."
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,I buy it for a beginner so i think he wont notice a big difference.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,And I think a softer rubber with thicker Sponge should be even better for him.
204,5f6c3734220a4650ffffdd7d,Inexpensive replacement for Sriver L /EL,See if you can get juic driva smash on sale.
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,There are some reviews on the Table Tennis Database:
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,729 Focus I Reviews
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,Focus I is slower than Focus II.
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,Mine has a light green sponge.
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,"It offers good control and speed, but it is not super fast."
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,It is a good quality blade.
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,"Good at chopping and looping, but I don't think it excels at either ... but then again I don't know of a rubber which does..."
206,5f6c374b220a4650ffffdd8c,Ritc/Friendship Focus I,"Yes I agree, and the focus III is even slower and has the softest sponge."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Neither Focus nor Higher are very similar to Hurricane, Focus being completely different (almost totally non-tacky)."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Higher is extremely good for just about everything but it has a Euro-type feel to it, so you may not like it."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Globe 999 Nat is probably the closest to Hurricane in that it's very tacky and pretty hard.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,It's also quite fast and an absolute monster for looping.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I think you'd like it.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"The black is a bit tackier, and thus spinnier, while the red is a bit speedier due to the minorly reduced tack."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I've also heard good things about some of Galaxy's high tension rubbers like Venus.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"If you like Hurricanes, Hobbes is right Focus is way off."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Higher is much closer only still a bit different.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I would say that 729 SP Transcend is fairly close in feeling to Hurricanes.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,The SP's even have a comparable weight.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,The Globes are a nice idea too.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"The SP is really durable, and doesnt lose it's tack for a long time though."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,In fact it hangs onto it's tack far longer than the Hurricanes do in my expirience.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Personal preference I would play the Higher III over all of it actually.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I did hear somewhere that Transcend SP was designed for the national team like the National versions of the Hurricanes.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,In my experience SP has a higher throw than H2 and H3.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,A lower throw rubber which may be comparable could be something like Sprungfeder and if I was going to stick my neck out I would go for the A-4 to be more like H2 and A-2 (not ITTF) to be more like H3.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I must add though that although I have had experience of both Hurricanes and both Sprungfeders it was not for long and quite some time ago.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Personally I would go for the SP.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Hehe,"
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Welcome back JKC!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,It's always good to hear you sing the praises of SP!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I was just sat here and I just new my beloved SP had been mentioned somewhere, I just had to find out where."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,The Higher III is also a good rubber which I found really suited my game but I did have issues about its durability when you really stress it with heavy loops (probably gluing was part of the problem too).
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I found it really easy to crack the pimples on the back of the topsheet which produce tell-tale ridges in the rubber surface.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,It you don't have a heavy loop then you will have no problem and ignore what I am saying.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Have you found any problems like that Skippy?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"If it is a red sheet you have, hold the rubber in the sun and at certain angles, some of the pimples in the zone where you mainly hit the ball will appear a little lighter."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,This is the first sign that pimples are beginning to crack.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I understand that you like to loop, so this could be a problem you may face."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I have had the same problem with Higher I and FocusI too.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"SP has the same problem also, but the pimples are bigger so it seems to take much longer to have an effect on the rubbers performance."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I haven't expirienced anything quite like that yet, but I definitely don't glue like you, and I dont get to play with the frequency that you do (lucky bastard)."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I don't have Higher III.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I used a friends.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I have SP and Cream which both seem to have a good deal of durability.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,You are right about SP that stuff is tough stuff.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I also haven't really examined my rubbers under light of any sort of strong lighting.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I should sometime as I think it would be interesting.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,You can see right into many of the red sheets so it is easy to spot problems before they show themselves on the surface.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,The cracks would start to appear after only one or two knocks with the rubbers mentioned above.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"With SP, it is a couple of months (playing maybe 5 hours per week)."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Another big advocate of the SP on this end!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Go SP!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Go SP!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"If SP can't do it, nothing can!"
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SP!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"wow, what an active forum."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"hmm, ok pretty much convince on the SP rubber."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,might go for that rubber.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,thanks guy...
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,i second the sp as well.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,when i gave up the Hurricanes due to their inconsistent quality
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"control, i found the 729 sp rubber."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"i tried Wangnan sp & now trying 729-2,"
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,both are good replacement for Hurricanes.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,You know I have not tried the new generation 729-2 because I had the old 729-2.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"It was not a good looking piece of equipment, but I heard the new generation version is exceptional."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Tell us something about it if you would.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,erm.... the problem is i have not tried the older generation so i can only compare it to Wangnan sp
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,since i have used both on the H.King.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"regarding the topsheet, both are rather similar in quality wz the Wangnan sp being a bit better."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,difference is not substantial tho.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,both are as spinny.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"sponge wise, the 729-2 is a bit more powerful ."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,potential speed is also higher for 729.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,it has a cream coloured sponge (dunno what kind of sponge it is)
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"if u ask me which do i prefer, it would be the 729-2. it feels like a better matchup wz the H.King."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,i'm happy wz the increase in power.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,so what do u guys think of the Yasaka Zap rubbers?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,is it a replacement for hurricane 3?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I have only tried the 'Spin' version of Zap and personally I was disappointed with the lack of spin for my type of shot (brushing).
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Throw was too low for me also and to top it all I killed it too quickly by over gluing it and causing the topsheet to detach.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Due to the lower throw, it is probably nearer to H2 than H3."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,It is pretty quick and clicky with glue though but super priming may cause problems with topsheet.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"JKC,"
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I never hear of anyone having detached more rubbers from their sponges than you.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,You must be a habitual over gluer.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Do rubbers run in fear of you?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I mean I dont even think eacheng would approve of all the rubbers they send off to slaughter if they knew the cruelty of it all.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,It is a combination of the glue (no more) and the way I contact the ball when looping.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,You have to bear in mind that just because I have destroyed a rubber previously it doesn't make it a bad rubber.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"My style of loop, both forehand and backhand is very hard on rubbers."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Having said that, both Zap and New Era were some of the easier ones to detach rubber from sponge."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Basically in the past if it was a chinese rubber and it said made in Japan on the sponge it didn't last very long on my bat (Zap, New Era, 999/999T Jap etc)."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,99% of players would probably have no problems at all with any of the rubbers I kill.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Now my wife stays at home to look after the kids though and we have only one income I have to be a little more choosy about what I put on my bat.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I'm getting curious on how you're punishing the ball, JKC..."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I loop more and heavier than anyone I know.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Against chop, float, and topspin (the one that causes the damage-off the bounce I think) at the table and away from it, I hit the ball pretty hard with lots of top."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"When I play British League, I often get comments that people have not played anyone who spins the ball so much."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I used to have a similar problem when I used Euro/Jap rubbers.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I was splitting sheets of Neos, Bryce, Mambo, Carbo etc every other week for the same reason."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,It got very expensive so I made the switch to Chinese rubbers which actually suit my style more.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Is there any version of Transcend with lower throw ?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Just had a brief hit with a 729-2 on Transcend sponge -- it feels similar to a Globe 999 Nat, somewhat lighter and softer."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I assume that Hurricane 3 is somewhat harder than these two, it's been a while since I used H3."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Wow Yuzuki, you dug this post up from a while ago LOL."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I was reading it and thinking Skippy was back in town, until I saw the dates LOL."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Well, I kinda dug it up because I had a hit up using the 729-2 Transcend, and I must say, it's a cheaper replacement to H3/Globe 999Nat which is sort of lighter too."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"It's my first time playing with a Friendship rubber (discounting the Super Soft FX) which I liked, and recommend for use."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I have a sheet of red 729-2 Transcend and is not even remotely tacky as Globe 999Nat, I don't have this rubber, but I saw it on somebody's else blade."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"If H3 is as tacky as H2, I never touched a H3, I doubt that 729-2 Transcend is a replacement for any of the rubbers you mentioned."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Maybe Transcend SP is similar with these rubbers.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,The 729-2 rubbers I've seen are quite tacky actually...
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,That's what I saw too -- 729-2 rubber kinda tacky.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Maybe because it's just a newly opened sheet afterall.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Are there significant differences between the 729-2 , 729-3, and the SP Transcends?"
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,The Transcend sponge seems quite ok.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I checked today again to be sure that I'm not confounding with something else.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Like I said in the previous post mine is non-tacky.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I have other rubbers from 729 and here is what I found:
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Transcend SP and 40H on Japanese sponge are the tackiest, also the hardest."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Cream on Japanese is tacky, but not like the first two."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,729-2 on Transcend is non-tacky (I asked somebody else to test it and he said is non-tacky).
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I had a hit with the 729-2 Transcend again, and in all my purposes, it's not exactly like Globe 999 Nat."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I currently have it on a different blade, so I might have to put it on my Extra 3D to be quite sure."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"It feels, I dunno, more bouncy than the Globe 999 Nat."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I could still do my loops -- just not with the exact feeling.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"It could generate loads of spin, though."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I'll keep playing with it to be able to see where to place this 729-2 Transcend in the rubber charts.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I'll see the SP Transcend if I still have funds, hehe."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,From memory the 729-2 topsheet is quite a bit firmer than the Globe 999.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"The 729-3 is much less tacky, and quite a fast rubber."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Cream has a mildly tacky topsheet, and it's thick and soft."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"Great, sounds good."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I'd love to hear what others think about these rubbers, since I'd like to know the differences between each (without actually buying them  )"
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I think the 729 transcend will be slower than the H3, as it's the original 729 topsheet on the new transcend sponge.... it should be tackier too as the H3 is not really that tacky."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Is there any Juic rubbers that can be a good substitute for H2?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Something that plays similar but with more dynamic and speed?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Juic Nanocannon...
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Slippery H3 isn't all THAT tacky.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,There are lots more tackier rubbers.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,My H3's will not hold a ball for even a second IIRC.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"My Three-Nine 999T Blue Lucifers on the other hand will, after a good spinmax treatment, pick up and hold a ball indefinitely."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Thanks for the suggestion!
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I'm not looking for something very tacky, but has good grip that allows loop driving like H2."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,I suppose Nanocannon also feels hard and has low throw?
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Like I said before 729-40 H is very similar to Hurricane2.
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Maybe a little bouncier
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Geospin tacky is the tackiest thing I've tried...
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,"I partially agree, however I've tried 729-40S (Jap sponge rather than German) and didn't like it much cause it didn't have enough dynamics (felt too rigid and not grippy enough)."
208,5f6c3782220a4650ffffddab,Rubbers that feels like Hurricane 2 or 3,Not sure if that's typical of these sheets; maybe I had a bad one.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"It sounds very interesting but you used booster, I only use Falco Tempo glue."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Is the Venus on your shop the same as the one you tried?
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),So so I have two problems:
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"- My first idea was to find a rubber to avoid speed glue (as I play several days a week, it is not easy to reglue regularly with such long drying time)"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I like the Joola EGP but find it to fast.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"- I f I order today or tomorrow, I will have to cross my fingers as I have a hardbat tournament in France on the 22 march and of course I need a Dr Evil at least one week before to train a bit and choose the blade."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),The 2.0mm version (from the shop) is the one I used.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),The 2.2mm version is a harder 40deg version.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Shipping is unpredictable as you know... we're at the mercy of the postal system...
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),It is generally within 2 weeks to most places in the world... but no guarantees
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Thanks Alex and could you compare it to a European rubber?
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Yes I know, the delivery time may vary  for the forehand it is not a problem, for the Dr Evil, I need it for the tournament."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I have to decide quickly and I don't want to buy a rubber which will stay in my bag because it doesn't suit me.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Hi Haggisv,"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted)," So far, Venus in Max, 35 degree is my replacement for Energy."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I use it in Max and tuned.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),It plays very similar to Energy.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Without tuning, it is a little slower than Energy."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted), The tack wore off in a few sessions but it is still spinny.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),It will brush loop very easy but counter drives are my main weapon.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I have one sheet that I have wiped the topsheet with lamp oil daily.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),It is REAL spinny.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I am useing it to find out if there is any damage to the sheet in time.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Two weeks so far.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Interesting, as far as I know the 36-38deg is the softest available... are you sure it's 35deg, or is it a different sponge?"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"I use spinmax, so keeping it tacky won't be an issue."

209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Would this be a good rubber for both hitting and looping and punchblocking?
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"It was excellent for both looping and hitting, but remember it was glued up with Falco booster so it won't quite behave the same way without..."

209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),don't worry I have my lamp oil ready!

209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I went through alot of other stuff trying to find a less expensive rubber.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),At $14 Venus is my setup.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),It does everything my Energy did.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"It is ordered, if I can, I try it as soon as I receive it."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Hi Hookshot...I have LKT Pro XT which is a tacky rubber as the name says..(XT = extra tacky) and that has remained tackier than it was new for 3 - 4 months now with Spinmax, and an occasional treatment of Eucalyptus Oil and a stint in the sun or under a light for 2 hours brings up that glossy tack that I cannot live without...lol...."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Its quite dramatic what the EO does and the rubbers just slurp it up...apart from helping maintain tackiness, this EO treatment causes the topsheet to become tuned...Ie the increased size makes the topsheet more dense and adds speed.."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Anyway, it might not be a bad idea to get some Spinmax Aqueous from Alex...it would be there before you know it, and also try the EO in the sunlight if your sun is warm, or 100 watt light globe at about 12 inches ...watch the heat."

209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),fosss
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Thanks for the review Alex!
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"I've been looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this rubber, as I've been looking to try it out for some time now."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"By the way, I was able to try out some 999 national on a cayman the other day; you weren't kidding about the spin on that sheet!"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),It felt great for looping--tons on speed and spin--but I couldn't chop worth a damn with it...
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Foss, do you apply EO to the sponge and the rubber or just the topsheet?"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Do you find it increases the overall dimensions of your sheet, and the shrinks back, but not to original size?"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"If so do you trim it, or does this only happen the first time?"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Yep that's pretty much spot on!
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I was able to do a couple of hits with a Venus 2.2 mm and felt great ; very euro-like .
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"I liked the low-throw and the ""kick""."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"ok, i have used this venus 2.2mm black sheet for the last 4-5times and after using it as is out of the package, i decided to see what it was like super priming it and giving it some spinmax, it was a monster!"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),i love the extra gears in it and the kick is amazing.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),the low throw sure frustrates people i play with!
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"anyway, it sure is a good piece of rubber that does everything exceptionally good and cheap!"
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),i have found a replacement for some of my euro/jap rubbers.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),i think that boosting it is the go since speed glue will be banned...
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"overall, it will be something that i will stick with for a little while as my forehand is now more consistant and has more variation with transition from flat to spin/kicks with a matter of rotating my wrist."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),im beginning to love this new sheet!
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),i was wondering it the red sheet has the same tack?
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),That's good to hear!
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),I doubt the red will be as tacky.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),BTW How does the low throw frustrate people you play with?
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),basically the low throw makes them think that it doesnt spin much or that it is more of a flatter hitting shot rather than a spinning ball.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),also that when my stroke seems like a heap of spin has gone into it and the ball does not rise much they tend to mishit or misblock...
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),my hitting partner was telling me that he tends to step back a bit getting ready to counter and yet the ball has dipped before he gets to counter it.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Low throw rubbers also tend to cause the topspin kick after the bounce to act differently.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Hmmm intersting...
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"I've certainly seen balls kick differently from different rubbers, but I've never try to relate it to throw..."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Not already tried it but are you still happy with the Venus?
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"I think my Era is a bit slow without speed glue and a bit to hard but as I win a lot of matchs, I really hesitate to change it."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Yes I have not changed my mind on it.
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"I do find that in 2.0mm it bottoms out a little, only in fast counterloops away from the table...of course the fact that it's only 2.0mm has a lot to do with this..."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),"Compared to the 999 Nat, the venus is much more controllable, except the 999 Nat gets a bit more spin, it's a little easier to do real slow spinny loops (as the 999 topsheet is softer) and and it never bottoms out..."
209,5f6c378d220a4650ffffddb1,Review Galaxy/Yinhe Venus 36-38deg 2.0mm black (boosted),Trying venus in 2.2mm again is another option for me...

210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I love JO Coppa Gold.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Donic also makes F1-HS, which I have not tried."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"It is not easy to find, but is said to be 50 degrees or so."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I have tried some Palio and New Era 50 degree rubbers in the past and they are REALLY fast, as with compared to with Tensors!!!"
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,The down side is that these guys weigh a ton!!
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,!
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,What's the main difference between Plasma 470 and Coppa JO Gold?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I read they're both highly durable?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"What's their speed like, about the speed of Bryce/Hammond (unglued)?"
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Which is easier for soft loops?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Bryce unglued would be sssllllloooowwww by comparison.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,The slowest Plasma (ie the 380) is faster.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,The JOGold has a slightly softer and grippier topsheet IIRC.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Meaning it's a bit easier to slow loop with.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,To answer your Q Suma
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Yes there are Tensors with Hard feel, mainly the HS variants."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"F1HS, XtendHS, Plasma 470, Quad480"
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Similar to H3 or Sriver?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Nope, not even close."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"They are faster, clickier, more lively but lack the bite of Chinese/Japanese rubbers."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Thanks for the feedbacks.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I suppose HS = ""Hard Sponge""?"
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,These rubbers sound pretty fast.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I was thinking of something with the speed of Bryce/Hammond unglued (so only moderately fast), and with enough power to loop the ball away from table."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I imagine all of them have low to med throw?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Are they all similar in weight?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I'd say those hard tensors are maybe 10-15% faster than unglued bryce,hammond at best."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I'd rather have the bryce/hammond and keep the long life and grip.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I'd take the Bryce for the higher spin/grip too.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Thanks for the suggestions.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I think I'll just try out either Bryce or Hammond at this point.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,It sounds to me that Bryce is grippier and lower throw than Hammond?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"For touch shots, is Hammond better?"
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I noticed from DT's mass db Bryce is nearly as heavy as chinese rubbers - is that about right?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,yes bryce is grippier with a lower throw
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Yes, it's a few grams lighter than the chinese rubbers, but much faster and less spinny."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"If you take speedglue into account, the chinese rubbers will probably be heavier again - requires more glue."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,After some hesitation decided to try out Hammond first before Bryce.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Its control is brilliant.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I played it unglued, but I can see it can be a phenomenal rubber glued up."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Even unglued, the sponge is surprisingly loud."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Do you think the topsheet is spinny?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,My hammond X was quite bad while serving.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Is regular hammond similiar?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Yes, Hammond is similar."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"From initial impression of inspecting the topsheet I thought it would be quite spinny, but it turns out to be lacking."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"It's hard to create very spinny serves, but I found with enough toss height and racket speed it can still be pretty spinny."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,It's typical of other classic rubbers in its class I suppose.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I use it for BH (RPB), so I won't be using it for service."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I disagree, it is not just a matter of speed, the Tensors feel better than unglued Bryce."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I've not had durability problems with JO Gold, but I had major problems with F1."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Ok, well the 470 is lower throw and faster than the JO Gold (which is slightly spinnier, but wears out faster)."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"And I haven't had another hit with the Bryce Speed until recently (due to its high price), but I'm once again certain that BS is as fast, if not faster than 470 and the JO Gold."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"All tensors bottom out on me...if not, then they behave strangely when you want them in their top gear (like throw and touch all change)."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Jap rubbers bite so well, you get confident in using their top gear."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I dunno, that what I've found through EJing several times 'round."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,You gotta find what works for you.

210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,It could be that it's because my blade is a little softer than the one's you guys use?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Or maybe it's because I loop from a little closer to the table (because I use short pips on the BH)?

210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,This thing is rather brittle.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I guess it could have been worse  If it was a tensor, it would have torn the topsheet."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,playing against LawOCG last Friday has killed yet another sheet of Tango Extrem.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,If only Bryce Speed costed less and c=doesn't weigh like H3!!!
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,GAH!
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,keep ripping it in the centre?
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,These stuff are way too fragile ...
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I wonder what makes chinese rubbers much more resistant to damage.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,I bumped an H2 against the edge trying to save a net ball and sent my blade flipping to the table.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,A light wiping fixed it right up.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"Donic F1, F2 and F3 crumble around the edges without contact with the table, I think it just dries out or something."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,Touch the table and you will tear them and have to change the sheet.
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I don't have that problem at all with JO Coppa Gold, however you still need to change it about once every 6 weeks for optimal looping."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,"I am ok with that, because I like the way it plays A LOT but some might find that annoying and too expensive."
210,5f6c3790220a4650ffffddb3,Tensor or Tensor-Like with Hard Feel,A compensating factor for me is that the short pips on my backhand side last a long time.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"focus 2 is lower throw than sriver L , almost the same speed and is tacky."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,More like a harder Bryce with tackiness
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I have 729-40S which has soft german sponge and it is very nice to play with.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Very grippy and a nice throw level.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Not as high as some, not as low as others."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,This also comes in 729-40H which is the harder sponge version.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I haven't used that one, but I assume it is also nice to use just with harder sponge."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Perhaps this will lower the throw?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Anyway, just to let you know there is another option with 729 than just the focus range."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"If you step away from 729, Dawei Inspirit and Navigator are very nice rubbers with a Jap/Euro design influences too."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Some will dissagree with this but I find Venus a perfect replacement for Energy GP except it is a little slower.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Everybody says it is tacky but only for an hour or two of use with a new sheet.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It remains very grippy.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"New, it would pick up a ball for a second or two but after one session, it no longer will hold a ball."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It feels just like the energy topsheet after use.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Yes, I clean them and use protector sheets."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I have it on max sponge and use it for an attacking game, loops, loop drives and it has a good slow game also, pushing, blocking."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I switched to Venus because of the price of Energy.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Venus runs about$14.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Neon, it has been too long since I used Shriver so maybe someone else can compare Energy to Shriver for you."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I find the 802-40 on max sponge, plays close to an inverted, very spinny for a pip."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,One thing I can do with 802-40 is to flat hit through chops or loops eaiser than with inverted.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It will loop and counter loop but not with as much spin as inverted.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It will make VERY spinny serves.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I would second the recomendation of inspirit/inpirit quattro.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I know it's not friendship, but it really is one of the best chinese replacements for euro/jap rubbers."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Hookshot, on your recommendation I got a sheet of 802-40 (2mm sponge though) and have it on my Hurricane King."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It feel quite nice to hit with and I think I do get similar spin to inverted.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I'm not offensive enough to use it effectively with the 729-40S on the other side though.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,So I think I will put a LP on the 802-40's side and put the SP on something else to keep trying to improve my skill with it.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"At the moment because I tend to block and push on the BH, its too fast on that blade for me."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I think if I was a real hitter, rather than blocking and pushing I'd attack on the BH to begin and it would be brilliant."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Perhaps I'll have a good enough BH one day to adopt that style if I practice it some more lol.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"If you use the 802-40 for normal loop and drive strokes, it works well but the spin is a notch lower than a good inverted."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"But, if you use it to flat hit, the stroke is entirely different than a loop."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"The blade is almost vertical and you don't try to add lots of top, just go right into the ball."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"If it is done right, your bat will come across you, not go up by your head."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It is two entirely different strokes.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,The 802-40 works better than most inverted because it is not as sensitive to spin.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"When you get it right, you can flat hit amazingly low balls."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It is an all out shot.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,You cannot hold back and make it as the spin takes over.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I concur with Hookshot on the Venus.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Suitable for an attacking game, has tack, then wears off to be only grippy, but it is not a Sriver clone."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I tried it unglued and it was good for my BH.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Eventually, I will get a tuning product and try it out tuned."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Now Dawei Inspirit Quattro, that rubber is the bomb!"
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,You use it for what you use sriver - a controlled game.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"This rubber, however suits me way better."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Quattro is a built - in rubber that comes in several sponge hardnesses.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I tried 35 and 39/40.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Quattro feels more powerful with pretty much the same control.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It lasts real long as well.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Some sorry bloke on this forum wrote a pathetic review on this rubber - read it with a grain or two of salt.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Both rubbers cost around USD $15 retail.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I used to buy exclusively Euro and Japanese rubbers, until I noticed how few equipment I got for USD $100."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,The talk on these forums about the improvement of Chinese rubbers motivated me to try out Euro like Chinese blades and rubbers.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,My two primary outfits are Chinese and the ones in the near term will also be Chinese.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Have fun with what you choose.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"With Raystorm, a rubber very similar to 802-40, my backhand loops are more effective than they ever were with inverted."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"They are not as spiny in absolute terms, but what is more important, my opponents tend to misjudge the spin and block it long, actually more often than when I used inverted."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"The loop is a bit slower than with inverted, and many players mistime it."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I keep it on the table more.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Every once in a while I can open the racket angle a little, but use more wrist and hit it really hard."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Since it is SP, it is great for blocking and flat hitting, and it has a nice feel for pushing once you get the technique of it."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"However, if you are mainly a chopper, forget it."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Hello and thanks.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,What do you think about sponge of focus2?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Is it elastic like euro/jap?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I talking about hardest sponge in top rubbers.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Or it is more like traditional chinese sponge?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,... like a harder bryce ...hm.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Do you think focu2 has a harder feel?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,May be focus2 isn't like top euro/jap rubber.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"May be it is still ""chinese"" rubber  ."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Do yo try focus1 and focus3 and do you use speed gluing or it's replacement?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Thanks.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Thanks.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,What do you think about top sheet of Dawejj Inspirit and navigator?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I.e.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"is it like chinese (tacky and thick with short pimples) or it is like euro/jap top sheets (light, thin with long inner pimples)."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,What is the deference betwen inspirit and navigator?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Look like which srivers do you think or other euro/jap rubber?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Thanks again.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I have 2 black inspirit sheets and 1 red navigator.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"The inspirit pimples seem to be thinner bit not that long (hard to see being black, they may bury into the sponge some), while the navigator seems to have thicker pimples that look short."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,The topsheets on all of them are not tacky but are grippy.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I have never had sriver so I can't make a comparison sorry.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Hello friends.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I read information about many new chinese rubbers.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"There is so many rubbers  : friendship, dawei, galaxy which of the them with several types."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I read about dawei inspirit in this site.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Just in the beginig of coments I read:
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"""Some compare it as being simialr to Butterfly Bryce FX, but with more spin and control."""
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Bryce FX is good rubber but soft, if it as being similar to Bryce it will be a different matter  ."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,With euro/jap rubber is so easy and simple.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Looking for offensive inverted rubber.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,These rubber usually are in two types: top and soft version.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"For example: bryce and bryce FX, sriver L and sriver FX, sriver G2 and sriver G2 FX, torpedo and torpedo soft, almana and almana saund, and so on."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Sometimes manufactures produse medial types like sriver EL and some andro rubbers.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"All these rubber from different brands are with your's specific performance, but these rubber are so closely."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Some top players play with bryce, others with sriver L, others with torpedo, others with almana and so on."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,And same rubbers I looking for.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Use speed glue yet  , pleased and like these rubber."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I don't understand Why chinese don't produce euro/jap influences top ruber!
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,What do you think friends?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Is there that sort of rubber?
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Thanks a lot again and excuse me for bad endglish  .

211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I would recommend to buy a Sriver (if it is to expensive try to get a used one), so you can't do anything wrong."

211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Hello friends.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,It is an iron logic and it's so corect to my regret  .
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,My be I said was not what I meant properly.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Bryce, sriver and so many others rubber are the only one of theirs kind."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"I don't looking for just the same, but a top one."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,For example between euro/jap rubbers have not so offensive types.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,Among butterfly's rubber (I know these rubbers better) there are cermet and catapult.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,These rubbers aren't so offensive especially catapult.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,They are offensive type rubbers but not a top one.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"In butterflyonline.com for example catapult is in section ""super speed""."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"But you can't compare catapult with sriver L which is in section ""all round offensive""."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"Others examples: Tackifire-Drive, flextra are a real all round offensive rubbers."
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,I sure in euro/jap market have many more same examples and in chinese market too I am sorry to say.
211,5f6c3795220a4650ffffddb6,Looking for replacement of expensive euro/jap top rubbers,"But I still looking for, what do you think about focus III rubber or about globe 999 with jap 40 degree sponge?"

212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,When I first discovered this forum and shop I ran across a review of both those rubbers.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"I think it was on the shop review site, so I suggest having a look there."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"From memory the Skyline was considered a nicer looking rubber, but the advantage of it ended there."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,I seem to remember the reviewer (who may have been LAWOCG saying that Skyline was hard work to get looping compared to H3.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"But don't trust my memory, go search for it."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"Cheers,"
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,Reb.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"Yeah, I already know LawOCG´s review but he tested Skyline 3"
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"with some layers of Speedglue, which makes the rubber very different"
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,from the unglued version.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,But I still told me somethign about the quality.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,I am still not sure if its a waste of money for me or if I shall try it.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"I've never actually tried the skyline 3, but I don't belive it's that lively."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"I have tried skyline 2 in 1.5mm, which is fantastic for hitting/blocking pushing style game...not sure id that help...."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"The LKT Pro Xt is quite a bit slower, and much softer sponged rubber..."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"It can generate a lot of spin with little arm movement... i really liked this one, but in the end I found it too slow on my blade (energy wood) which is already not that fast..."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"Hmm, ok thanks, I think I will come back to"
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"my good old Hurricane 3 2,2mm and stop testing"
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,for a while
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,XP is very very soft.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,It's very very slow when unglued but has amazing sound and spin when glued with respectable speed.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"For chopping, though, it's not great."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,I chopped for a few months with XP on the forehand and found it difficult to create anything other than float or weak backspin.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"My counterloops, though, were ridiculous."
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"If you're on the very offensive end of the ""modern defense scale"" then XP could work, but otherwise stick to the hard, tacky rubbers like the Hurricane series"
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,Hmm if its slow AND doesn´t chop well its not what I search for.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,I want a really fast rubber with which you can still chop.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,Spin is very important for me!
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,For example: I played Globe 999 nat (black) on a De-1 (i would rate it Off-)
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,glued with 4 layers on VH fo some days.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,The Speed and control was great and I could vary the spin in defense very well but I couldn´t do heavy chops with MUCH underspin.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,I ordered a Hurricane 3 and Kokutaku 868 40-43° (both 2.2mm)
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,now cause I think they´re the best choice for me.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,I really think the Hurricane will make it.
212,5f6c379c220a4650ffffddba,Hurricane 3 or Skyline 3 for Defense?,"If someone knows more about Skyline and thinks it could be the right rubber for me, please tell me"
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,have you tried 999 national in red?
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,I heard that's much closer to Tackifire C than the black 999 national.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,I have tried the DHS H2 Blue Sponge and it's a strange rubber.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,The first few sessions I really liked it for serving and super spinny loopdriving.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,Smashing and hitting felt horrible.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,After that I started to hate it I could do any loop at all!
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,It's a rubber you will have to get used too.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,Oh yeah I thought the sweetpot was quite small as well.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,When I didn't hit the ball with perfect timing the shots seemed very weak with very little spin.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,Dead blocking is really good.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,Hitting and smashing was also very dead very different from euro/jap rubbers I couldn't get used too it.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,But it's a rubber I really want to try again.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,probably with some booster and a good fast allwood blade.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"I have the H3 (but with orange sponge) and the 999 Nat, but they are on very different blades."
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,I am considering changing a sheet of H3 to a different blade (perhaps a T-2) to see how it performs there.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,Generally though I have found the H3 to be pretty good at a nice loopy arc that drops down quickly at the end.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,The 99 Nat is also good for looping but I don't think its arc is quite as big as H3.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"Now the H3 is on a carbon blade both sides, so quite a heavy setup (190g)."
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,The 999 Nat is on all wood with 755 on the other side so very light (140g).
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,So I'm imagining the effect of this needs to be taken into account.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"Overall, I like both rubbers."
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,I'd say the H3 is a bit softer then the Globe and gives a bit more dwell time.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"However, I would have to say the Inspirit Quattro on my K-3 has it all over both of them at this point!"
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"Guys , try to put these rubbers (H2 or Globe999 National ) on FAST , STIFF , CARBON blades !"
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"I played with Tibhar Samsonov Carbon+H2 blue sponge ,Tibhar Samsonov Carbon +Globe 999 National , T-2 + H2 orange sponge , T-1 + H2 orange sponge."
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,"No matter what hardnesses the rubbers are , if you HIT the ball with the sponge not just gently brush it with the rubber you will have plenty of spin and plenty of speed."
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,I have tried Hurricane 2 Blue sponge with 3 thick layers of haifu speed glue on my wsc(soft carbon) and it felt much to stiff and dead with zero feeling.
213,5f6c37b6220a4650ffffddca,H2/H3 blue sponge compared to Globe 999 Nat?,you don't need a hard blade for that at all!
214,5f6c37b8220a4650ffffddcb,Andro Impuls /impuls Speed,"Hi,"
214,5f6c37b8220a4650ffffddcb,Andro Impuls /impuls Speed,i am currently using this rubber in max on my fh and finding it really nice to play with and heaps of control and spin.
214,5f6c37b8220a4650ffffddcb,Andro Impuls /impuls Speed,but then i just came off speed gluing so i dont know what it would be like for choppers as i mainly spin and counter hit.
214,5f6c37b8220a4650ffffddcb,Andro Impuls /impuls Speed,it is a soft feeling rubber that matches nicely to a hard/fast blade.
214,5f6c37b8220a4650ffffddcb,Andro Impuls /impuls Speed,blocking is also very good.
214,5f6c37b8220a4650ffffddcb,Andro Impuls /impuls Speed,i would think that it suits an attacker who also wants control and placement of their shots.

216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,I tried the moristo 2000 and it was dead in one week.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,But if you prefer less bouncy rubbers why do you want tensors?
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,They're really bouncy you would be better of with something like Hammond X or something.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Hi Agooding2,"
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend, I have been trying lots of LPs and SPs for the backside.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,I ran into a pip that acts like a pips in.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"The 802-40 will loop, chop and serve."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,The RITC 802-40 is different than any other rubber I have tried.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"If you pull a ball across the surface, it feels slippery but it will make as much spin as most pips in."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend, The sheet I have was given to me and appears to have 2m or max sponge.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,It feels lighter than most pips in.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Might be just what you want.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,i have tried both rubbers.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"moristo2000 has a better feel for the ball compare to Xtend, which is more bouncy."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,my experience was wz Hinoki J-pens.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,rubbers might feel slightly different on all wood blade
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"if u're looking for really light rubber, Nittaku Hammond is in the feather weight category."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,black is much better for RPB cos the ball will slip wz red making slow loop technically more
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,difficult to execute.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,(my experience)
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,i'm trying out red Sriver G2-FX on my H.King BH & it feels light too.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,i think its good for RPB.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"tho its soft, its not weak nor too bouncy."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,control is good!
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,i can BH loop better now as the dwell time
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"is longer than Focus 2, my previous BH rubber."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,i'm also delighted that the topsheet is rather similar to Catapult.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,very good quality & better grip than sriver red.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Can't wait to play wz it again later today!
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,hahahaha...Happy .
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Thanks for the advice, I was thinking Hammond X might be a good option."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"You're right, if I prefer less bouncy rubbers, tensors are probably not the way to go."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,I tried F1 once and won't again.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,I've used 802-40 before and it's a good rubber but I prefer a bit more spin to contrast with my short pips forehand.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"I'm not sure about the weight of Nodias, but you could just try either Cermet or Sriver."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Cermet felt pretty light to me.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Also, although it's really fast and fairly bouncy, I loved using a thinner sheet of Juic Varites on RPB (I used 1.8, but I think even 1.5 would be fast enough)."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,It's featherlight and can generate pretty good spin.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Sriver is nothing special compared to Nodias
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,In terms of weight or performance?
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"When I've hit with regular Sriver it felt fine, but the sheets were pretty old and I didn't really test it."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"I still like Nodias, just not the weight as the blade I'm using now is 10 grams heavier than my old one."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Mambo C is okay weight-wise but slippery and a little low throw unglued.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,I may try Donic J.O.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Waldner in 1.8 but that probably won't save all that much in weight.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,both.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Of course Sriver is fine but it doesn't do anything better than nodias.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,cermet is quite light.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"How does Varites compare to Hammond-X or Bryce-FX in terms of bounce, spin and throw?"
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"I've been using TSP Brio for RPB, which has good speed, but I'd like something with more spin."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Sriver series is a good choice too, however I want to avoid gluing."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"In the same sponge thickness, Varites beats regular Bryce in speed, both glued and unglued, but I think it has better gears than Bryce too, since I would always pop up pushes with Bryce, but they're still fairly easy to keep low with Varites."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Because the sponge is a bit harder than Bryce and the topsheet is a bit softer, you're going to have to make a slightly different motion to generate spin, but it's just about the same in spin overall, perhaps just slightly better."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Throw is medium, so you might need some adjusting to keep your shots on the table at first."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"In general, I don't think you should use it on a hard blade; it feels a bit too unstable on those."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"If you pair it with a medium or soft blade, it's really great."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Edit: Oh, you said Bryce FX."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Well it's definitely faster than the FX version, but its spin isn't as high when unglued."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Because the sponge on Varites loosens up a ton when you glue it (although you can use boosters as well, since I see you don't want to glue), I'd say glued (or equivalent) Varites is pretty close to unglued Bryce FX, but with the same treatment, Bryce FX is going to win for spin."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Hobbes (or anyone) what is the difference in effect from speed glue to boosters.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Do boosters still wear the rubber out quicker?
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Are they applied to the sponge or topsheet?
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Cermet is pretty light.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Hammond X is very light.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Perhaps you could try something like Joola Air Rossnet.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,It's very light and not really all that bouncy from what I remember.
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"I've never played it right out of the package, but it's very very light."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"Some boosters are only made to be put on the sponge, some are made to be put on both the topsheet and sponge."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"They wear rubbers out more slowly from what I've seen, but some (like Falco Booster) give nearly all of the positive effects of speed glue nonetheless."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"They really can vary, though."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"EEII only gives about 20%-30% of regular speed glue's effect, Falco Booster gives 85%-95%."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,"I'm using Falco Booster now, and I don't really have any second thoughts about switching back."
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend,Cermet is a very nice rubber
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend," i have been using it yesterday and today,"
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend," its fast and spinny, but i also find it easy to control"
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend, its very good for slow heavy spin looping and very good for driving
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend," its good close to the table and away from the table,"
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend, The topsheet is kinda grippy and its OK for serving
216,5f6c37d3220a4650ffffdddd,Moristo 2000 or Yasaka XTend, i don't usually flat hit much so i can't comment on that aspect

217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I doubt you will find anything that has the similar characteristics and durability for a cheaper price,making Markv and sriver pretty cheap imo,coppa and JO are very good and similar but no real difference in price"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,It's sort of a pity that these players are paying such a high price for these rubbers that they wind up looking for alternatives.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,They're not expensive rubbers!

217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Yes BTY is expensive in AU, but some of the other brands we CAN buy direct from the manufacturer, so it's obviously cheaper for us, so we can make the sell price cheaper too."

217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Nittaku Ellgard - What a gem.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"It seems hard to find these days but lies in between Sriver and Mark V. It's faster than the former, slower than the latter and comparable in relation to spin."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Distance wise, I'd say Ellgard is good when playing close to the table like Sriver and is pretty good at mid-distance, but Mark V wins the day when looping from distance."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,How come OOKT doesn't sell it?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,The only place I know that sells it these days is http://www.spintechnologies.com/nittakurubbers.html.

217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Haggisv I was refering to the plain old Coppa it's the harder of the 3
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Waow !
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Thks a lot !
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,I had no idee Ellgard was still available.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,I even thought it wasn't manufactured anymore due to its disappearance in the catalogues.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I 100% agree with Woodie, it's a gem !"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Yeah when I think of Ellgard I think of the golden days and Table Tennis Summer Camp....ahh.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,I might glue up my old pair next week just to see if there is any life left in them.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,It's just a shame that I made a circular indentation in one of them when trying to close a refill can of speed glue!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,How is the old Inspirit vs Mark V or Sriver ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Darker's Provine series are a good bit like Sriver.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"OH PLEASE STOCK THEM, OH PLEASE."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"But really, Provine Tension-50 feels a lot like regular Sriver to me, except faster."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"They also have regular Provine, which is probably like Sriver EL and Provine SV, which I imagine would be like Sriver FX."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I'm just making guesses at those, since PT-50 seems to feel a bit harder from the tension, so the untensioned version would feel slightly softer, and then SV usually refers to a softer sponged variant."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,What signifies 50 ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,50 degrees hardness ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,How are the tensioned Sprungfeders compared to Sriver ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Nope, the 50 is just tacked on at the end for no reason."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Hardness is somewhere around 41 to 43.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Aha .....
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,anybody tried Highpoint ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,is is supposed to be a desto f2 clone which is superfast ...
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I read a review somewhere that it wasn't quite as spinny as fast as F2, but very close."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Never tried either myself, so I can't give my own opinion."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I think Cream MRS is a nice alternative to Sriver only in that I typically prefer Chinese type rubbers to jap/euro, but no."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,They are very very very different.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Sriver is faster, non tacky, and much more consistent in sponge hardnesses."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Cream MRS is slower, medium tacky sheet."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"The MRS sponge version is supposed to be somewhat similar hardness to the Sriver L, but most of the time you aren't really sure what hardness of MRS you're going to get."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Cheers guys!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,OK so we have:
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Donic Coppa
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Donic JO Waldner
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Darker's Provine series
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Nittaku Ellgard
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,With a few more questionable ones like:
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Dawei inspirit
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,JUIC Driva Smash Ultima
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Dipper I / II
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Focus I / III
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,I don't think F2 or highpoint are similar enough to sriver/mark V since they are tensor style rubber.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Similarly Dawei sprungfeder is quite different since it's mildly tacky and the sponge is under high tension.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Anyone else think of any other, or comments on the ones above?"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Cheers!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"FocusII VERY similar (bouncy and feel) , BUT different kind of throw."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Desto F2 same throw difference and different feel (being a tensor) and more bouncy than Sriver.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Inspirit Quattro close to the Sriver feel and throw but not so bouncy like Sriver.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Cheers vali!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"The focus 2 sponge would be a fair bit harder than the sriver I would think, so many may not perceive the feel as similar."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,The focus I is softer but I have not tried it yet...
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Perhaps the standard inspirit may be close to sriver, but of course there are so many versions of the inspirit with different sponge hardnesses, so it's hard to know"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Or maybe he shlould try Cream on japenese sponge, works for me and I was known like Sriver L,S man..."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,or Cream with German sponge (with Leopard pic)...
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Yeap , I was comparing Sriver L - I think the hardest Sriver(my daughter's  ) and Quattro 39 degrees"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Cheers!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,What about the Coppa TAGORA - perhaps similar to sriver EL?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I think Tagora is slower than EL,it's a similar sponge hardness and about the same spin but a lot more controlable than the sriver family,it works well on fast blades that are fairly hard."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V, If someone is learning how to loop then Tagora is your rubber of choice because it has dwell and not that fast i.e.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,the ball does not come off the rubber to quickly.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V," It does not smash well and you need to put topspin on any ball you hit with Tagora.It's a VERY light rubber a Tagora Max cut to my blade is 41 grams vs a sriver fx 1.9 is 47 grams,it has a very elastic topsheet and a fairly high throw."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V, In essence the rubber is a great rubber for beginners and intermediate players but not fast enough for advanced players.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V, Put it this way if you can't loop with Tagora then you can't loop period
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"heh heh, nice summary alfie!"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I do know one local higher level player here that uses it, but he glues it up so that would change it quite significantly."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Cheers!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"I used to glue Tagora on an SC it was great for my FH,but I have gone to a slower blade.Actually since this post has come up I just glued with CTE the Tagora on my T4 which is my backup blade I will see how it goes on monday,I know it will be nice on the T4 but I will be using it for BH as I have H3 provincial on the FH"
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,What about Highpoint from 729 ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Anybody used it ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Is it faster than Sriver ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"The coppa's are a good bet, I had the Cooper S I would say its in the same range as the Sriver/MarkV."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,JO is quite good as well as an alternative.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Haven't tried the provine and ellgard but I think the Provine was a japanese tensioned rubber ?
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Not really clear on that.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"The F1/2/3, Highpoint, Toppoint don't have anywhere near the same feel and linearity as Japanese rubbers."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,If you could get some real 35-37# (not 40ish) Inspirit Quattro then that would drop the weight down abit and also increase its speed and feel.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,This could be a very good alternative.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,JUIC Driva Smash Ultima - Played with this and the topsheet isn't as great as the Sriver/MarkV.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Its got a Stiga style thin topsheet and wears out pretty quick compared to the Sriver/MarkV
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,No idea on the Dipper's but the Focus 1 is something to at.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Provine Tension-50 is pretty heavily tensioned, but they have regular Provine, which is quite similar to regular Sriver, and Provine SV, which I would imagine is probably similar to Sriver FX."
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,PT-50 isn't all that different from regular Sriver in anything but speed either; there seems to be no sacrifice in control for all the extra power.
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,Thanks guys!
217,5f6c37d6220a4650ffffddde,similar to sriver or mark V,"Well , I must add Sword King in 42 hardness - very bouncy and lively is a good replacement for Sriver in my opinion."

218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"I sent my sheets to LawOCG, so hit him up for impressions when he recieves em."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"As for Omega 2, It's got a very grippy topsheet, softer topsheet than other tensors and a choice of sponges, depending on who you buy from."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"While this generation of tensors is far more durable than previously, they're still rather weak compared to the above."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"Not sure if you've used Tensors before, but the have a different feel to the above and also a different feel to glued up rubbers."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"Only rubber I've played myself is Hammond Pro Alpha, which is a great rubber for close table attackers."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,Off the bounce (euro) looping is great also against backspin.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,For mid-distance control is to low.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,Pretty good with serves short game for non-tacky rubber.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,Reacts to glue (and probably tuning) very well.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"According to a german supplier Xiom Omega 2 is an ""german-newest-generation-Tensor"" like Coppa Gold/Silver."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"The asian version slightly softer than Coppa Gold, the european slightly softer than Coppa Silver."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,IMO both Coppa's play pretty good as long as you don't rely on spinny serves and/or a good short game or chopping.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,For a modern defense game I wouldn't recommend them because the Hammond Pro Alpha lacks control from away-table and the Xiom would force you to loop all the time since an occasional chop will be hard to control and probably ineffective.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,Well Slippery if the Tackifire C is anything like the Tackiness C that I had on my BTY bat you won't be disappointed.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,It chops like nothing else and after 25 years it was still going strong.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"I had so many people hit net dives last season from it, it was poetry to watch."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,I had a hit with it last night for the first time after hitting with all this new equipment and I almost got a lump in my throat.
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"The old girl still felt as good as any of the new stuff, even after all the testing and mistreatment I've thrown at her since she retired."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"She's tatty, but she still feels like she's got it and would take anyone on as worn out as she is LOL."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"Ah, yes we are talking about a PADDLE here   Sorry gettting a bit nostalgic."
218,5f6c37de220a4650ffffdde3,Banda rubbers/Advice for a red Fh rubber?,"A 25 year old bat will do that to you, and leave you feeling like a cheater for swapping LOL."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"I did a review of Actor, if you do a search it should come up."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"As for them not being popular, I think it's not so much the rubbers as it is TSP's lack of marketing that might account for that."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"As far as I can tell, TSP is a great brand."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Yes, what JSK said"
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,The Actor I tried wasn't anything special.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Non-tacky topsheet, fast sponge."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"40 deg palio/saviga is around the same speed category, maybe a tiny bit less."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,I will say it was better than Nanocannon though.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,True.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Got a sheet of Brio and find it pretty well made.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,It's topsheet and sponge play quite consistently.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Basically a European style rubber.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Topsheet is fairly bouncy and neither tacky nor grippy, but can produce good amount of mechanical spin."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"On Yasaka MLC (which is a fairly soft blade), this sheet feels soft/delicate on touch shots and can be fast with loops/smash."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,It has good control as well.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Given it's play consistency, control can really just get better and better."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Overall, I'd say it's speed is about OFF."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Basically not terribly fast, but has the gears."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"So far the most important negative aspect I found about the rubber is the user  I've always used chinese/japanese grippy rubbers and have gotten used to the ""feel"" of grippy rubbers when serving, pushing and looping."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Big strokes looping is definitely a no-no.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Really struggled to loop with comfort and confidence, although there were a few shots when I felt I had hit it right and produced nice mechanical spin from the rubber."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Well, ended up spending a couple of hours losing to a couple of players."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Although I felt like giving up on this rubber, I find this an opportunity to learn Euro loop technique ... Well, so, can someone give me a quick tip on Euro looping?"
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,I think it's supposed to be compact?
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,More open blade surface?
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Sort of like a salute?
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"yes, kind of like a salute, but make sure you're engaging the sponge and not just grazing the ball."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Had another tryout earlier.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Still finding looping pretty tough.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Fairly consistent during drills (e.g.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"FH to FH), but very tough with varying ball speed, especially with 3rd balls."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,Easy to hit the net (stroke too forward or too small upward) or go long when loop too hard.
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Your main problem is almost certainly that you're not digging the ball into rubber consistantly, but are still brushing the ball."
219,5f6c37ef220a4650ffffddef,TSP Brio/Actor,"Keep telling yourself to hit the ball into the rubber a bit more, and it will get better."

220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"I am using LKT Pro XT at the moment, (I prefer tacky rubbers and maintain the tackiness with Spinmax) and it is very light compared to Globe999nat for example..."
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Using the LKT rubber and OX Neptune on a TSP Balsaplus blade, my full made up bat weight is just 133 grams which is very light as you can imagine..."
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I have not played with the Balsaplus blade yet so I cannot say if it is a good combination at the moment...
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I have played with the LKT rubber and it is a very soft sponge and very spinny and about as fast a Geospin tacky...very good control...mine is speed glued with Falco Unlimited
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Srivers sponge is a lot firmer and the top sheet is not tacky nor anywhere near as spinny...LKT Pro XT is a lot tackier than LKT Pro XPand the XT version has spin generated by 1/ mechanical grip in the soft sponge, and 2/ tackiness"
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I need it light for my girly shots...lol.
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"..not really, it's for my TT elbow, which was caused by using a bat that weighed 200 grams."
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,fosss
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,"Yes the LKT or the 729 Supersoft are very light, and both midly tack... the LKT XP least tacky, then LKT XT and then supersoft - the black is always tackier."
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,They would certainly be slower than sriver in the same thickness...
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,I can't comment to much on sriver since I'm not a sriver fan at all.
220,5f6c380b220a4650ffffde01,LKT XP/XT vs Sriver L,Thank you guys !

221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"The marginally harder surface of the SST729 produced excellent control shots, allowing both dropshots and flicks to be done relatively easily."

221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Skyline 2 has a surprisingly high amount of control over the table.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Definitely higher than SST729 and 999 Nat.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Spin seems good, possibly less than that of 999 Nat as the topsheet isn't quite as sticky."

221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I had some difficulty looping for a first few hits.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,The throw felt considerably lower than 999 Nat and SST729.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"As with SST729, well hit loops stretched low and flat with a visible kick."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"With only 2 layers of FC, the sponge felt slightly softer than SST729 and very ""corky"", more than 999 Nat."

221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,The 2.2mm sponge feels thinner somehow.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I might spend more time on it before I move on to the next one.

221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"1 layer of 729 normal glue to prime, 1 layer of FC."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Before I start the usual format, I just want to say that this is the stickiest rubber I've used in a long time - stickier than 729."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I could pick up a ball (provided it wasn't powdery) and literally wave the bat around without dislodging the ball.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,On to the review.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Over the table.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,First impressions of Skyline 3 is that it is SLOW.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I was having a considerable amount of trouble flicking due to the speed and the amount of stickiness the rubber had - this was due to technique, as I'm used to a soft, fast rebound grippy rubber."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Pushing was definitely the spinniest so far.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Control was brilliant due to the speed (once I had gotten used to it).
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Close to the table
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Again, control here was brilliant."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I felt more like I was catching and throwing the ball back.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Throw was actually quite low (possibly due to the stick?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"), but once I had adjusted to that, it was fine."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Loops kicked a bit, but the stickiness was reining in the speed too much."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,This could be possibly better after the topsheet has been broken in a bit more.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Mid/Long Distance
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,In short: Too slow.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I'd need to revisit this with more glue.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,This rubber feels more to me like a 3rd ball attack rubber than a rallying rubber.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Had another hit with Skyline 2 tonight.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"2 layers of Mill chack, 36 hrs old."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Felt really hard.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Conclusion: Don't use LL
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Good work Silver.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Skyline 3 seems like a winner for me but they all sound good.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Good to hear they all more dense compared to orange Hurricanes.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,That would make it better.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I'm back to this.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,On and off.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I tested TSP Triple 21 2.15mm black, primed with 2 layers of clean chack and glued with 2 layers of falco tempo."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,First impressions of this rubber was good!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Soft topsheet combined with a soft sponge allowed for a mechanical spin approach to looping, but the moderately sticky rubber increased spin on serves dramatically and on the table play."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Speed was slower than that of the other, harder rubbers."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Slower than a harder topsheet sriver fx and cermet too.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Throw exhibited was very high.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Over the table:
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Over the table was very spinny, with easily controlled flicks going on with less speed than the others."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"The soft sponge allowed easy control of heavy ""dig"" pushes."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Close to the table:
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Due to the high throw, looping vs both chop and top was a dream."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Definitely a looper's rubber; not so much an off-the-bounce blockers rubber.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Returns were possibly a bit high and slow, but the ability to place the ball whereever on the table more than made up for this in my opinion."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Mid/Long:
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Counterloops carried more spin than speed, was easy enough to counterloop and had enough speed to trouble people."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Again, control was outstanding, especially on the loop to loop."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Conclusion:
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Move over Juic 999 Elite Ultima!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I've found a new favourite sticky rubber!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Thanks Silver!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"When I first took this rubber out of the package, it seemed completely non-tacky."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"However after I had a hit with it, and cleaned, I found a plastic sheet would actually stick to it, so I would also class it as a mildly tacky rubber..."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,hi sliver
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,what is the weight/mass of the tsp 21?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"if you have not yet weighed it, does it feel light say comparing to the LKT xt/xp series?"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Aslo what made you choose the tsp 21 over the juic elite?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,So you could consider it to be lightly tacky rubber too huh Silver?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I knew I wasn't crazy!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I tried it once and I was sure it had some tack.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Yeah, I liked it very much, although when I tried it I don't know that the sponge had been primed or speed glued as much as the sponge probably needed."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I would really love to know how long that the tack is going to last on that rubber too.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"It's a light rubber, in the vicinity of LKT XP"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,IMO It's a far better rubber than XP though.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,It's light->moderate tack.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,it's a lot faster for one thing...
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,TSP Triple 21 35 2.1 blk 57.5 0.204991
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Hi Alex/Silver
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"i notice in your shop Alex, you have the TSP tripple 21 but it is said to be 37deg?"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,so where did silver get the 33deg from?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"regardless, does it feel as soft as the LKT XT?"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,how much faster is it comparing to lkt (say lkt was 7/10)?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,how tacky is it if lkt was say 8/10?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,thanks
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"LKT XP, OR LKT XT?"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"It's marked as ""35 +/-2"""
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Haven't tried XT, but XP is softer and mushier without as much spring compared to triple 21."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,XT is probably tackier though.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"The ""33"" is relative to the other rubbers."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,If I put the manufacturer specs down everything would be out of whack.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"It's marked as ""37 +/-3""."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I reckon this sheet is about 35, if I compare to a sheet of X's F1 21 which was 35 +/-3 and harder."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Haven't tried XT, but XP is softer and mushier without as much spring compared to triple 21."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,XT is probably tackier though.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Not a lot of difference beteen the Xp and XT... more differecen bewteen red and black of the same rubber.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Black is definitely tackier.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,The triple 21 sounds like a looping rubber I might be interested in for the BH.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I will soon replace my emergency downshift of BTY Tackiness Drive with Euro like Chinese rubbers and a few Galaxy blades for funning around.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,The TSP seems like a decent one.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I tried out only one other TSP rubber (Actor) before.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Hrmmmmmmm
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Triple21 seems to lose it's tack rather quickly.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,What doesn't?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Perhaps it's not designed to keep the initial tack?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I actually didn't find it that tacky at all, and was surprised a plastic sheet stuck to it... it generated plenty of spin on loops though..."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Which keeps it tack longer?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Triple 21, or 999 EU?"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,999EU
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Triple 21 loses the majority of it's tack quickly, but still has a wee bit now."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Topsheet is definitely softer and I'm getting more spin off loops.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,hey silver
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,how is the tripple 21 compare to say something like donic f3?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Unfortunately I've never used F3.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I've used F2 and F1 extensively though.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Triple21 is spinnier, softer (probably not softer than F3 though) and less bouncy."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Probably faster heavily glued though.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,had a go with the black 2.15mm tripple 21 tonight with 1 layer normal glue and 2 layers speed glue and it was not bad at all.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,plenty of spin and a nice sound for first glue application.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,quite a fast rubber with good control and is nice to topspin with on either fh or bh.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,i think that priming it will make it really shine!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,the topsheet is mildly tacky and the sponge is nice and soft!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,it is relatively light in weight as well!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,the throw is medium to low.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,will report on it further once i get to have another go with it... maybe in a week or two as i did my back and still have not recovered from it (reinjured it last night whilst playing).
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,i think i have found a sheet for my backhand!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,finally!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Had a second hit with Bty Tackifire C Soft 2.1 red tonight.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Will have a third go with it tomorrow and report back.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Speed scores may be a bit skewed as I'm using it on a different blade to all of the prior tests.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Really nice so far.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I'm getting less spin on my serves at the moment though as the topsheet is much harder than my usual rubbers.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,By listening to all the other characteristics of this rubber I have a hard time imagining that this rubber has a throw any lower than medium high.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Also if it is medium to low throw than I am thoroughly disappointed.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"hi skippy,"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"dont get me wrong, this is a really nice rubber, the medium to low throw is really good, it keeps the ball low enough so that slappers have a hard time smashing my topspins."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,i think it really shines on the back hand where a bit more wrist action can be generated.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Note: Still have to do my Hurricane 3 BS writeup.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Mini Conclusion Time
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,We've got two classes of rubbers here really.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Soft & Hard.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Hard class:
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Tackifire C, Hurricane 2/3/BS Skyline 2/3, Friendship SST729 God Favoured, 999 National"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Silver's pick: 999 National
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"If you're a Hurricane 3 user, get a sheet of 999 National."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,It's got a better sponge than both regular and BS.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"In a pinch you could grab a sheet of Butterfly Tackifire C instead of the 999 National, because it's pretty much a copy."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I suspect that the Tackifire C sheets are a bit more consistent from sheet to sheet, but costs 2x as much."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,2nd place: Tackifire C
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,3rd place: Hurricane 2/3 BS
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"The hurricanes were nice, but the sponges could have been better."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Mounted on an OC, HH and WSC they were consistently slower than 999 National and Tackifire C."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,What I didn't like: Skyline 3.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Huge stick and dead as a doormat, even with a heap of glue."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Soft class:
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Tackifire C Soft, 999 Elite Ultima, Triple21"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Silver's Pick: Tackifire C Soft.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"this one plays more like a softer, corkier Tackifire C. I'd like to imagine that it's on top of the Sriver EL sponge, but I'm not sure."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,999 EU is a bit easier to loop with and plays more euro-ish while Triple 21 is softer and easier to loop with again.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Tackifire C Soft's topsheet is harder than the latter two and better for quick attack.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I don't suppose you'll be trying out any of the Nittaku Hurricanes for this.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Correct?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I might want to try out Triple 21 if it indeed settles down to just be a high-grip sheet, and does actually have a low throw."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I gotta get another sheet of 999 Nat as well, seeing how I killed my original one."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,I don't think it's particularly low.
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Good stuff Silver!
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I prefer the 999 Nat over the hurricanes as well, but found the hurricanes faster with a flatter trajectory."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"They still would have been very spinny and ooponents found then just as hard to block, but I just could not get them in as consistantly, and the 999 Nat felt better and spinnier at lower speeds."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"The blue sponges of the Globe have actually been very consistant, although I cannot feel the differece between 38 and 39deg, and they are a lot harder than that."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"From what I understand, the 999National is supposed to be pretty tacky."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Does this apply to Tackifire C too?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"A friend of mine has both black and red Tackifire C and they are not tacky, just very grippy."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Or could he have a Europe-version or something?
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,hmmmmmm
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"I can't say anything about the black Tackifire C, but the red is pretty much identical."
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Silver, what do you think about Chop and Chop II?"
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,Haven't tried Chop II
221,5f6c380e220a4650ffffde02,[Silvers Reviews] Sticky rubber shootout Updated 19/9/07,"Chop was pretty average, but then, I wasn't exactly using it to chop."
222,5f6c383f220a4650ffffde20,Review Juic 999 Elite/Geospin tacky.,nice review!
222,5f6c383f220a4650ffffde20,Review Juic 999 Elite/Geospin tacky.,"In regards to the ""fake chop"" you described, against what kind of spin were you able to do this with?"
222,5f6c383f220a4650ffffde20,Review Juic 999 Elite/Geospin tacky.,I'm guessing that finishing the stroke below table height to hide the upwards wrist snap would be most effective.
222,5f6c383f220a4650ffffde20,Review Juic 999 Elite/Geospin tacky.,I've been practicing the same concept except with sidespin.
222,5f6c383f220a4650ffffde20,Review Juic 999 Elite/Geospin tacky.,"More of a trick shot than anything else, but when you pull it off it looks pretty sweet"
222,5f6c383f220a4650ffffde20,Review Juic 999 Elite/Geospin tacky.,Way to do it to it dog... Lay it on them...
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Gewo Thunderball is the tackyest rubber I ever saw,much much more tacky than H3,for a euro type rubber I would say tackfire special soft it has a very mild tack almost can't feel it but it it a very spinny rubber"
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,for euro I think I'd have to say Stiga Magna.. but again thats also a slightly tacky rubber.. if you want to know which nontacky but grippy rubber is most spinny then I really wouldnt know I'm afraid.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,So tacky rubber ar always much better to serve then grippy ones?
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"And when I said european and chinese I meant what kind of style do you have to play with this rubber, european or chinese style."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,depends on how tacky/grippy a rubber is I suppose but in general you can create alot of more spin on the service with the tacky stuff but if your used to euro/jap rubbers it might be a pain adjusting all your strokes to real tacky rubbers.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?," I agree Magna is great to serve with, very tack with a very Euro Feel,"
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?, asr1990
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"I like the Juic 999 series stuff, as well as the Tackiness C for serving."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,As a general rule the tackier rubbers do serve spinnier than the non tacky as they are able to apply a great deal of spin even at low ball pace whereas non tacky rubbers rely on the ball penetrating into the sponge to create spin.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,practice....practice....practice
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,....or basically any tacky chinese rubber would be useful and of course you would have to loop the chinese way
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,metal monkey
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,In general it's much easier to generate heavy spin with a chinese style tacky rubber than it is with a non0tacky rubber.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,Apart from that the slower and softer topsheets and sponges make it even easier.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Chinese rubber any day, or at least a Chinese topsheet."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Brush stroke spin is essential for a good serve, plus the ability to place the ball short."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Loopers rubber can achieve good spin but you have to hit the ball hard to achieve it, e.g."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,Almana Sound.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,You could argue that some of the Jap rubber such as BTY TSS is ok and thats fair comment but on the whole there is no better rubber for brush stroke spin then Chinese.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,You have to choose between:
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,1. a soft (Desto F2 is great ...)european rubber
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,2. any chinese tacky rubber
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,All depends on spin at slow speed ...
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Hey Mathias, I still use BTY Takifire SP Soft and it is OK for a European rubber, but I don't think it could hold a candle to 999, at least with me serving..."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"BTW, I hope you aren't all that mad I mis-spelled your name voting for you at DTTW stkar votingk..."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Hey Der_Echte, no trouble and thanks."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,I'm about to retire from the DTTW forum in any case.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,Historically there have been some great pip threads and debates on there e.g.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,going back to 2003 there are some very good pip posts.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Generally I think this forum has sapped alot of the energy from DTTW for pip players and there is not enough new Euro inverted stuff around right now that I don't know about - we've just about covered everything and also many of the big non-pip posts have been outside DTTW, e.g."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,Silver and some of your reviews.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"There were some classic DTTW threads though, the frictionless debates, great pre-made bat epidemic, some of the quick-fire exchanges with TTSam and Speedplay, your reviews of course, some of the pip threads were cool."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,I pop a post into DTTW to formalize this.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,It might be worth slowly assembling an archive of pip posts and rating them in terms of usefulness.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,DTTW does contain some real gems.
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"Having said all that TSS is a good rubber for sure, its the closest Japanese rubber I've played that approximates to a Chinese rubber and has loads of control."
223,5f6c384f220a4650ffffde2b,best serving rubber chinese/european?,"In addition you don't need to prime it, it'll play straight without glue."
224,5f6c3852220a4650ffffde2d,Kokutaku Tulpe 007 rubber or 868,i have some 007 rubber and i have testet the japan sponge - for me this rubber is to slow
224,5f6c3852220a4650ffffde2d,Kokutaku Tulpe 007 rubber or 868,Uli
224,5f6c3852220a4650ffffde2d,Kokutaku Tulpe 007 rubber or 868,Super Priming works well on Kokutaku Jap sponges.
