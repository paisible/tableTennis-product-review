2,1,5f711576bb596fe084f2597a,Experiences switching from T05 to Fastarc G1,"   Hello Simon_plays,As for me G1 seems at least of a same durability as T05.Seems it has no booster inside as I bought 4 in 2015 and opened one in 2019 - you should have noticed - it has no vacuum package - and still quality is really good and reduces not so drastically.",irrelevant
3,1,5f711576bb596fe084f2597a,Experiences switching from T05 to Fastarc G1,I like it more than T05 as T05 requires much more skill - I think that on my level and slightly above (and of course lower) G1 for FH (and C1 for BH comparatively to T05FX) suits more.I do not reboost it - just if drastically reduces grip - clean and set bit of Johnson baby oil for 20 minutes - after that remove it and clean it again.Of course just IMHO,comparative
4,1,5f711576bb596fe084f2597a,Experiences switching from T05 to Fastarc G1,"   To clarify, you put the Johnson baby oil on the top surface of the rubber, not the back surface before glueing, correct?",irrelevant
5,1,5f711576bb596fe084f2597a,Experiences switching from T05 to Fastarc G1,"Yeah - put that to the topsheet, not to the sponge.Sponge in G1 is much more durable and it's less thick than in t05 so lives pretty longer than it's topsheet (just my own note) Oil on the topsheet surface for 20 minutes makes it grippier even though topsheet is really thick in G1 and it is really grippy because of mechanics of pretty long pips under it.If you apply oil for more than 20 minutes  - it can ruin the surface and if much more time (like couple of hours), then even can lead to bubbles.",comparative
