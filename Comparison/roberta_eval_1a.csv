1437,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,I had it on Innerforce Layer Al and it was really mushy (like pillow soft) If you like the safety of soft sponge it is good but I thought it lacked power personally compared to Elp or els with not as much spin.,comparative

6130,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,For someone who has had little or no coaching you seem to be putting the effort into looking at how to improve.If you're dissatisfied with your FH rubber (I've no experience of jpen) you could consider sticking with the same rubber in a not so soft version - the Vega Europe.The Baracuda I wouldn't recommend - it's essentially an old rubber but for the Spin & Speed it gives it's not great on control.Genius Sound I know nothing about but it's rated at 37.5 degree compared to the 42.5 degree of the Baracuda.,descriptive
6131,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Genius Sound is supposedly a very good rubber but a more up to date version of it would the 5Q sound at the same 37.5 degree.Haven't tried the 5Q sound but the 5Q is a super rubber but imagine it would be too advanced for you at this stage but it can work well for Shakehanders on both sides depending on the blade.There's also the Joola Maxxx 400 which I haven't tried.Safe option.,irrelevant

6145,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control.,irrelevant
6146,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial.,irrelevant
6147,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge.,irrelevant
6148,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before.,irrelevant

8238,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,In the end I can use either H2 or Thors and play at the same level whatever but Thors is a much more powerful rubber and because you can bend the ball around the net at will and win points from full court length + do all kinds of trick stuff so easily it's much more fun to use so I'll choose it over H2 just for the fun factor since it doesn't cost me points although anywhere much below 2000 us level I think you would be better served with H2 just because it's so much easier to control.,comparative
8239,5f6c307b7da9e46ccbe1577f,H2 Neo or Thors?,"Make no mistake Thors is harder to use at full pace than any other tensor and any tenergy, it's very demanding but that seems the price you have to pay for a very powerful tacky rubber.The third rubber nathanso mentioned TG3 is probably the best bet for most people since it more side spinny than H2, not quite as deceptive as H2 but is more easy to use than either Thors or H2, it's actually softer in the top sheet than H2 and has the same sponge so any feeling of it being harder is just go old DHS variation or a harder degree sponge.",comparative
