9,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it.",descriptive,1
10,"Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer.",irrelevant,2
11,"Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good.",comparative,0
12,"Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine.",descriptive,1
13,"Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade.",descriptive,1
14,Just remember to keep your bat angle low.,irrelevant,2
15,Tenergy has many complaints of it being non-durable.,descriptive,1
16,"Some reviewers claim that with only a few days of playing with it, obvious cracks were in the rubber on the side.",irrelevant,2
17,Just don't throw it around on the table.,irrelevant,2
18,"I can't really comment how easy either one is to use, since they're suited for different playing styles.",irrelevant,2
19,"Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny.",comparative,0
20,"If driving's your thing, use Tenergy.",comparative,2
21,"If long, spinny rallies is how you tend to lean towards, Baracuda would be a better rubber.",comparative,0

34,"However, Tenergy has a better control, and has significantly more power.",comparative,0
35,"im a very big fan of tenergy 05, its great on both FH and BH, definitely not slow ( not blazingly fast either ) and an extremely spinny rubber, actually i rank its spin as second to hurricane",comparative,1
36,"Now that they announced Tenergy 80, I might be going for that or 05 but I am still waiting for reviews to come out first.",irrelevant,2
37,Fxp is more of a direct sponge compression type of contact.,irrelevant,0
38,Elp would be better if you brush,comparative,0
39,Thanks!,irrelevant,2
40,FX-P has a grippier topsheet and softer sponge than EL-P and is comparable to the Tenergy FX series.,comparative,0
41,I personally felt EL-P was better for blocking and FX-P for looping.,comparative,0
42,and i'm in square one again probably I will choose el-p as it's quite a bit cheaper in a place when I'm going to buy that rubber from.,irrelevant,2
43,I haven't tried fx-p but used el-p on backhand for a couple of years.,irrelevant,2
44,"It worked perfectly on a Off- allwood blade, but when I changed to a off- 5+2 blade with carbon/kevlar next to the inner ply, I had some problems with it.",irrelevant,2
45,In those soft/slow topspin hits it gripped the ball very inconsistently.,descriptive,1
46,Sometimes it would behave normally as before and sometimes it would throw very high.,irrelevant,2
47,So it depends on how flexible your blade is.,irrelevant,2
48,"I'm not surprised, felt the same thing.",irrelevant,2
49,Sorry.,irrelevant,2
50,"If it's a quite a bit cheaper, get EL-P, it's by all means a good BH rubber.",irrelevant,2
51,I play on 5ply all wood blade (dhs pg3).,irrelevant,2
52,Thanks all for your help.,irrelevant,2
53,"EL-S is heavier and feels a lot harder, even though the numbers (sponge hardness) are not that different.",comparative,0
54,Requires a better brushing contact and is less forgiving.,comparative,0
55,My experience matches Ilia's .,irrelevant,2
56,Also EL-S is more spin-sensitive than MX-P.,comparative,0
57,I've switched from EL-S to MX-P a couple of months ago.,irrelevant,2
58,"IMHO, MX-P feels easier to play with than EL-S, kinda more predictable.",comparative,0
59,"Indeed, that is why I switched to MX-P on my backhand.",irrelevant,2
60,"Thanks everyone for your input, What I really want to know is, has anyone experience EL-P vs EL-S....",irrelevant,2
61,I've play with MX-P on backhand before and found it too fast.,descriptive,1
62,Maybe the TTD review of EL-S will give you some clues (even though it doesn't compare it with EL-P)?,irrelevant,2
63,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg73LXt3KM8,irrelevant,2
64,I've been using EL-S for about 15h (which isn't that long) but I'm finding it great.,irrelevant,2
65,"Way more linear than other BH rubbers that I've tried such as T05-FX, FX-P and Genesis M. You get back what you put in.",comparative,0
66,FX-P is softer and has more catapult.,comparative,0
67,No one but.,irrelevant,2
68,Genesis 1 m is not fake it plays like fake xd,irrelevant,2
69,Depend on how good your BH is.,irrelevant,2
70,Mantra M is supposed to be easier to handle.,comparative,0
71,I have it on one of my blades for the moment and must say it is very controllable.,descriptive,1
72,Not particularly spinny though.,descriptive,1
73,Genesis is probably spinner but that may affect the control.,comparative,0
74,"I've used Mantra S on the BH, I prefer softer on the BH.",irrelevant,2
75,It's very spinny.,descriptive,1
76,Nice rubber.,irrelevant,1
77,I have not tried genesis but i use Mantra M on BH and i am very happy with it.,irrelevant,2
78,It does not have the Catapult effect but i can loop an underspin serve easily and the soft sponge gives you enough dwell time and it quite forgiving,descriptive,1
79,Sent from my SM-A700H using Tapatalk,irrelevant,2
80,"Mantra is a Japanese rubber to rival tenergy and might just go out of production over time, supply is low in Europe, don´t know whether Stiga will continue to distribute it elsewhere.",irrelevant,2
81,"Genesis is a hybrid rubber which pretty much plays like a Chinese rubber, sticky surface but very little catapult to support strokes, it must be played more actively than Mantra.",descriptive,0
82,"So, the question is not which one will give you more spin but which kind of rubber do you prefer?",irrelevant,2
83,Changing between different types can be demanding.,irrelevant,2
84,Genesis m is spinny and very durable.,descriptive,1
85,Its really difficult to cut.,irrelevant,2
86,Never tried mantra,irrelevant,2
87,TTDB/Revspin is bull?,irrelevant,2
88,German made rubbers like Gold Arc 8 have gone through a lot of development progress to finally arrive at a point where some equal t05 in spin potential.,comparative,0
89,"I liked GA 8, but I thought it was a bit like Donic bluefire M1.",comparative,0
90,"However, you might find it easier to generate spin with GA 8, while t05 has a higher maximum that not everybody can activate.",comparative,0
91,"Well considering the possible difference in skill and technique, and the fact that anyone can rate, its kind of hard to really be 100% reliable.",irrelevant,2
92,In reality its would much easier to start comparing rubbers and blades: Robots playing with Robots in an isolated environment.,irrelevant,2
93,But manufacturers probably don't want that kind of transparency.,irrelevant,2
94,I have played with both.,irrelevant,2
95,"There are two GA8s, 47.5° and 50°, in two thicknesses, 2.0 and 2.2mm, and in two colors, red and black.",irrelevant,2
96,Red and black felt the same to me.,irrelevant,2
97,The thickness differences had the predictable effect.,irrelevant,2
98,"However, hardness did matter.",irrelevant,2
99,"At 50°, things clicked for me; at 47.5° it played, for me, much like a wide range of the (upper echelon of) ESN rubbers.",irrelevant,2
100,"I prefer GA8/50 to T05, but still give T05 a distinct edge in spin creation.",comparative,0
101,"At the high end both were close, but below that T05 created more spin more easily.",comparative,0
102,"That advantage, for me, was more than compensated by GA8/50s handling in the short game, blocks, counters.",comparative,1
103,Were those in the same condition?,irrelevant,2
104,Both top sheet and sponge deteriorates over time.,irrelevant,2
105,O7P is much faster and spinnier.,comparative,0
106,I've tried O7P but not DNA.,irrelevant,2
107,"O7P is definitely a solid rubber, it has that 'click' feeling when you hit which is awesome.",descriptive,1
108,Results may vary.,irrelevant,2
109,Will depend a lot on blade.,irrelevant,2
110,When i was using The sriver in seemed to be alittle to slow and didn't have much spin and the control was nice.,descriptive,1
111,"As to the rubbers if you want to choose Butterfly, you can take T05FX to your BH (you can trust me, it is the best choice from the Bty offer) and then it depends how do you play with you FH, if you play close you can take T05, if you like to play in distance you can take T80.",comparative,2
112,"You can also try the XIOM rubbers - they are a long lasting good alternative to tenergy For example, I like to have a little harder rubber on the bh - thats why I take the PRO series there, but you could also try EUROPE for softer ones...",irrelevant,2
