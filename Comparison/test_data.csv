5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I'm also interested.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,maybe TTD can start reviewing some sp rubbers?
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I do not know if tabletennisdaily can reiview short pips.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Think they need someone that know how to play with them.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I think all three of them are considered grippy short pips so you can create some spin but there are less effect and deception.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"802 40 is not a rubber with inbuilt glue effect, think the two other are."
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,So the two latter is proably a bit faster?
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"I also think 802 40 is hardest, or atleast feel the the most hard."
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Try google and you will find alot.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Or ask at oaak tabletennis forum.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,They know more about pimples than guys here.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,How do you want to play and use your short pimple?
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Short pimple can be pretty different.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Some good for one style and some better for another.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"I`ve used to play for several months with 802-40 2mm on 35 degree sponge heavy boosted,"
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Also tested Impartial XS.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,Both on shackehand BH
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,To me impartial XS reacts too much on incoming spin and flat hits were to predictable for my oponnet.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I suppose it is ok on CPen or as Forhand rubber.
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"802-40 is very balanced but still feels a litle hard on touch shots,"
5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I suggest you to conisder Tutle Summer 3C it feels as upgraded 802-40- it is most balanced short pips i have ever tried.
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,"apolonia weight more, u can find between 85-90 grams"
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,IF ZLC- 80-85
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,I find Apolonia is more flexy and have softer outer ply and I love it
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,and I think has better quality than IF ZLC too
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,I find something special in Apolonia and this is the best blade right now if money is not the problem
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,thanks Konrad.
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,Is the apalonia faster then the Innerforce?
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,Apolonia is also innerforce...
5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,If you want to save money.I think DHS fang bo ALC or DHS H301 is a good choices for you that It is the same innerforce with different outer ply Limba for fang bo and Koto for H301.

5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"If you loop everything and are active in the short game with spin manipulation, Tenergy 05."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"If you block more and are a bit more passive in the short game, the more linear precision of T64 and T80 might be more to your liking."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I'm not sure about that.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I think T25FX is better than T64 for blocking and short game.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I don't know anything about the T80 though.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Lifehack: buy T05 first, then once it wears out, buy T80, or vice versa."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,This way you will learn by yourself how these rubbers play for you.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,And the difference between them is not that big so you can go from one to another with a minimal adjustment.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Depend on your skill.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I like hard sponge so t05 is my favorite.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"The sponge on T05, T80, T64 and T25 is all the same."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,The difference is not the sponge.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,It is the pimple construction.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T05 pimples are a little shorter, thicker, and closer together so the rubber feels harder."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But even the rubber in the topsheet is the same.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Just the pimple construction is different.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"To the OP, I would like to ask what he means by the word ""best""."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"I won't comment on T25; but T05, T80 and T64 are all great rubbers."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,There are people whose game and style of play may work with one of them slightly better than the others.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But they are all really great rubbers.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,There is a video that explains decently what the difference between each one is.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Once I am able to search for it, I will post it here."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But it has been posted to the forum many times already.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,That video should help you out a decent amount.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,To sum the info up simply:
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"1) T05: Slower, More Spin, Higher Throw Angle."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"2) T64: Faster, Less Spin, Lower Throw Angle."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,3) T80: half way between T05 and T64.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"So do you want a bigger arc, more spin to spin the person off the table but a little sacrifice in speed?"
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Or do you want lower shots that don't come up as much and are faster.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But with an amount of spin that is easier to counter.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Or do you want to be half way in between the two extremes?
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I go with slower and more spin every time.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Especially since T05 is more than fast enough.

5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Most people, including Butterfly reps, discuss T25 and T25FX as rubbers that are specialized Tenergies."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Most discussion is about T05, T64 and T80 as those are similar rubbers along a continuum."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"With the term best, I mean actually the best experience with these rubbers."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,The video mentioned I was actually familiar with.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But it doesn't give much information about the touch of these series at the table.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Tabletennis is not only about spinny topspin.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,For example how does each individual rubber reacts to spinny serves?
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I found that t05 is very sensitive to incoming spin and spinny serves.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,But T80 is less sensitive to it etc.

5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T25 is also a very-very good rubber, just a way different than other Tenergies and suits less people."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T80 has a little bit more control (for me), less sensitive to spin, but T05 is spinnier."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Yes, but that is if you are into passive returns."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"If you like to push and spin aggressively, the T05 reaction is a benefit."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,It's when you try to just touch the serve without any acceleration that using T05 is a nightmare.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"And that term best is still about preference and each person will feel something slightly different is ""best""."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Like, for me, hands down, I like T05 more than the others for forehand."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"For backhand T05, T64 and T05FX have all worked fine."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,If I used it T80 may be fine as well.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"But I remember when I tried it, I didn't try for that long and was used to T05FX and didn't give it much of a chance."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,The extra spin and higher throw seems to be more important to my forehand than my backhand.

5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Results may vary.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,05 64 and 80 all good.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Will depend a lot on blade.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Hi all, I've used T05 for a short time 7 years ago, too hard for me, then T05fx when it arrived in the market, a bit better but still hard even ewwith the softer sponge, surely due to the pimp construction, so the hardness of the sponge change not so much the ""feeling"" for me, then I switched to T64fx which is a great one in my opinion based on my play and my strokes."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"After testing Dignics 05 on a zlc blade after the end of last season I'm back to my primorac carbon this time with T80fx, that's a better combination for me as it gives me what I was looking for, so a bit more spin and control than T64fx."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"That's clear the complete Tenergy family and now the Dignics are great rubbers, but depending on your play not all of them would fit perfectly with you."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Very strange to see a post I wrote 4 years ago being quoted out of nowhere.
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Is there any particular reason you woke this old thread up?
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Yes, I was looking in the Tenergy family what's fitting the best with me."
5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Maybe this tread is old but what´s said is still actual.

5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Also there is a huge difference between two ZJK, just like there is between two viscarias or two TBS."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"I own two ZJK (blue dragon), one is just like my viscaria (new tag), the other is much much more powerfull, faster, larger sweet sport and to me a much better feeling also......despite being lighter than my other alc blades.....I will swtich to this one for the plastic ball maybe."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Two wood pieces are never exactly the same.

5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,new one must be better
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"KSP gave a very lucid explanation of WHY... but the MASTER of Viscaria, the mighty BAAL has yet to weigh in."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Yet, he might not weigh in, because he sees such a question several times a year on the several forums he is a member or a mod."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Baal has operated the Viscaria for longer than deep double digit percentage of forum members have been ALIVE.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"this is all so true, i recently in the past 8 months have bought 3 viscaria's."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,all 3 from butterflyonline
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,first one was really powerful
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,second one was flexy
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,3rd was some where in between
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,also i bought a Timoboll ALC and it was so powerful and fast i didn't match what the viscaria's felt like.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,anyway... i sold all my butterfly blades and switched to stiga clippers woods
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"the main reason is the butterfly handles are all too small, and thin."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,stiga handles are superior and the clipper has such a sweet feel and power ratio plus the weight of the clipper is what the poly ball is requiring IMHO.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"so yes.. even at the highest level maker of blades, in this case butterfly, all 3 of my viscaria's felt different and i am very critical of my equipment."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,btw i play in the usa and my rating is some where around 2130 - 2180 - just if you are wondering what level i play at.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I will one day sell the Phamster on the idea of filling in his hollowed handle Clipper to upgrade it to moar Beast Mode.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Der_Echte, I would love to see you playing with a Clipper with your modification done to it."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,That would be great.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I would love to try the blade too.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"I have one Clipper I could do it to, but, it is a bit too light so it doesn't really play like a REAL Clipper."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,It is only 91 grams and the one I used to have that was 95 grams was sooooo much better.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,If we filled the handle on that one it would play amazing.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,95 grams is a good weight for a blade.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Then if you have a Clipper that is 95 grams and you add 10 grams to the handle so it is handle heavy and weighs 105, that would play like a beast."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I would take that joker BEYOND Beast.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Hey, that got a ring to it."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Maybe we just made a new international standard.

5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Let's do it.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"If I remember to toss in my wood glue into the TT bag, I can always depend on the Philly Goon Squad to quickly produce a sharp blade for me (to remove the handle)."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"I can always pick up small metal pieces from the sidewalks, that could count as sustainable management and neighborhood upkeep."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I even have C clamps for clamping when gluing the handle back on.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I though that is why Carl was given two rows of teeth...
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"I sometimes use a clamp, sometimes, just hold it in hand until it sets good enough then wrap grip tape over it and call it a day until it is set by the next day."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"One time in Korea, I did this mod to one of the 896 Carl tried out and I played it 1 hr after I glued it back together, I used grip tape, it might be the one with Sigma Euro and H3..."
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I bet leaving it clamped for a day would make it so you can glue it back perfectly and not be able to feel that it was taken apart.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,You don't need that because you like grip tape on your handle.
5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I like having wood with no grip tape.

5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Wonderful post!
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks

5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So if you like to win points of the serve you probably won't be that far back so I would go with tenergy 80 besides I don't like 64 as a backhand rubber anyway for me I would use it as a forehand rubber!

5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I would say that t80 is very fast.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Too fast for me for BH especially with OFF blade.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I would suggest t05fx, it is softer more control and less speed, but still not slow."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I would say, play against any noob, and you can win your point off the serve."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"But if you are going to be serious and play against people that knows how to return your serves, 3rd balls, and so on, then its more your style of play + skills/techinque + rubber."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"By the sound of the above ""wishlist"" from you, your equipment is an overkill"
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"The 2 rubbers you suggested is all good for serve, chopping, rallies etc."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T80 is more suited maybe for close to the table, while T64 can go further back."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Other than that, it is really little difference for any player that is not ranked in the top level (in the top level, a 1% difference is a matter about winning and loosing)"
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,It is not only that.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"A lot of people like tenergy rubbers, especially those who played long time ago with Srivers boostes with a glue each training session."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,The problem is that some blades which are very offensive makes the set up with tenergies not easy to control.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"What I mean is the problem with short push, service return and short spinny topspins."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Nowadays tactics are focused on playing short only with BH side, so we can say FH rubber can be very aggresive to make powerful and spinny topspin, while BH side should be more allround to be able playing pushes etc."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T05FX is much easier to control and if you take it with 1.9mm, it is great for everything."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I wouldn't say that T80 is good for playing close.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,if you want to play close T05 if much better.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T80 with different dimension of pips makes the ball going higher so it is much better to play further then T05, but I cannot compare it to T64 because I have never try it."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,T64 has MUCH more spin than T80
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,why not tenergy 05 ?
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So what would the best rubber be for the BH?
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,And is Tenergy 05 a good choice for a FH Rubber?
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Thank You everyone so far for your help.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I think, just go T05 on both sides."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Timo Boll agrees btw
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,As for the blade which is best suited?
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Timo boll spirit, ALC, ZLC OR ZLF"
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Jak, growing in level in TT is like playing Pokémon... You gotta catch 'em all to win, so why not try 'em all and tell us what you think."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I was going to say, start from Timo Boll All and work the way up."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Otherwise I can always recommened the Timo Boll Spirit, since Mr Boll is using that with T05 on both sides, i'm sure Jak can end up in the world top 10 too with the exact same equipment."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Jak, how long are you in table tennis?"
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Sounds to me you are looking at a way overkill equipment.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"IMO, get a 2x rubbers + 1x blade at less than a price of those blades you have in question, and I'm sure that will be better for you."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Unless you think most expensive is the best, or fastest is the best, or spinnest is the best etc."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"FZD stated that he doesn't like fast, he prefers more control equipment."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,A 16 year old wise kid I must add.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I've been playing for 3-4 years.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I currently have a Joola K5 Fast blade with Mambo H Rubber on both sides, Which is good all-round."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I want to upgrade my set-up.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,At college my mate has a Timo Ball Blade with Tenergy 05 FH AND sriver g3 BH which I Used and really enjoyed.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,When i was using The sriver in seemed to be alittle to slow and didn't have much spin and the control was nice.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"But I would like a Rubber on my back hand to have more speed, spin and good control too."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Thats why I'm posting here because a certain amount of you have played with most rubbers and know which is better with which set-up ect.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,It seems your step is too big.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Your current set up is quite strange.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Most of people start with allround blade and then upgrade only the rubbers to faster.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Final change to OFF blade is only for really advanced players, when they lack of speed with allround blade and off rubbers."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,If you want to change everything I would suggest to choose OFF- setup.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"For instance blade Primorac JP OFF-, very good blade or Tibhar Stratus Powerwood."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,They are both OFF- blades but Tibhar is little bit faster.
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"As to the rubbers if you want to choose Butterfly, you can take T05FX to your BH (you can trust me, it is the best choice from the Bty offer) and then it depends how do you play with you FH, if you play close you can take T05, if you like to play in distance you can take T80."
5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"You can also try the XIOM rubbers - they are a long lasting good alternative to tenergy For example, I like to have a little harder rubber on the bh - thats why I take the PRO series there, but you could also try EUROPE for softer ones..."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy and Baracuda are actually remarkably quite similar, despite the $25 difference per sheet."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy has a slightly higher throw angle than Baracuda, so looping heavy chops may be a little bit easier, with a greater arc on the ball."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"However, Baracuda still has a medium-high throw so they're both perfectly fine for looping."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"In my personal opinion, Baracuda has more spin than Tenergy, however it lacks a little bit of power and control compared to Ten."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Just remember to keep your bat angle low.
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Tenergy has many complaints of it being non-durable.
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Some reviewers claim that with only a few days of playing with it, obvious cracks were in the rubber on the side."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"However, I've had my Tenergy 64 for about a few months now and it's looking fine."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Just don't throw it around on the table.
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Baracuda has never had complaints about it breaking easily, so Donic wins this one."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Maybe because the topsheet is a little bit harder.
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"I can't really comment how easy either one is to use, since they're suited for different playing styles."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"If driving's your thing, use Tenergy."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"If long, spinny rallies is how you tend to lean towards, Baracuda would be a better rubber."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"They're both very good rubbers in my opinion, though I would use Baracuda over Tenergy, because it is closer to my style of play."
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"In conclusion,"
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Ten has higher throw angle
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Ten is heavier
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Ten is more sensitive to incoming topspin, though can be adjusted with blade or sponge layer"
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Bara is much more durable (according to reviewers)
5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,I also personally think that Baracuda is a much better rubber in terms of worth for money.

5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Just remember to keep your bat angle low.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Tenergy has many complaints of it being non-durable.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Some reviewers claim that with only a few days of playing with it, obvious cracks were in the rubber on the side."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"However, I've had my Tenergy 64 for about a few months now and it's looking fine."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Just don't throw it around on the table.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Baracuda has never had complaints about it breaking easily, so Donic wins this one."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Maybe because the topsheet is a little bit harder.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"I can't really comment how easy either one is to use, since they're suited for different playing styles."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"If driving's your thing, use Tenergy."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"If long, spinny rallies is how you tend to lean towards, Baracuda would be a better rubber."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"They're both very good rubbers in my opinion, though I would use Baracuda over Tenergy, because it is closer to my style of play."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"In conclusion,"
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Ten has higher throw angle
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Ten is heavier
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Ten is more sensitive to incoming topspin, though can be adjusted with blade or sponge layer"
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Bara is much more durable (according to reviewers)
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,I also personally think that Baracuda is a much better rubber in terms of worth for money.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Dammit Butterfly.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,Hope this helps
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Eric T, AUS"
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Thanx, I'm a loop oriented player on both wings."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,it surprises me that Ten05 is less durable(price) and less spinny then the Baracuda.
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Yes, it is a little bit shocking since you would expect to get an extremely overpowered rubber for ~$80 a sheet but actually, Baracuda surpasses Tenergy in spin."
5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"However, Tenergy has a better control, and has significantly more power."
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,good question.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,I am intersing on yours blade so i want to know too
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Heavy-headed blades?
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,This is the first time I've heard of this.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani, You will be able to see the difference between 2.1 and 1.9 if you compare the bats side-by-side.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Or you can use a ruler.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Anyone ever compared the weight in a scale for Tenergy 1.9 and 2.1?
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,"Well, actually there is!"
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,"Check it out, http://tabletennis-reviews.com/refer...size-database/"
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Nice link you got there.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Easy to search and compares all other rubbers too.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,So it seems that...
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Tenergy64 (2.1) = 67g to 68g
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Tenergy64 (1.9) = 63g
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Tenergy05(2.1) = 70g
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Tenergy05(1.9) = 66g to 68g
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,There is about 4g different for 2.1 and 1.9 sheet uncut rubber.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,"So after cutting it out, I assume, the difference would probably be 3g then."
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,3g for both side is equal to 6g.
5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,I suppose 6g makes a SIGNIFICANT difference for smaller sized guy like me.
