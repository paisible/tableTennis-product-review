3333,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,I did a little search on your blade and it comes up as stiff and fast.A high throw rubber compensates for the stiffness giving a better arc allowing one to land balls on the table more easily.Problem with high throw rubbers is control.,descriptive
3334,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Most opt for medium throw on the BH for control reserving the high throw for the FH.If you're starting off it's not recommended to have a stiff blade and a high throw rubber.The little that I know of pips is that a stiff blade is beneficial.,irrelevant
3335,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,Personally I would compromise the stiffness for more flexibility allowing you to use medium to low throw rubbers so that you can get your technique right and learn to play more easily with looping etc.So maybe another thread might be needed to see if you could use a less stiff jpen blade ?Normally with a rubber the arc starts to flatten out the harder you hit - only exception that I've found is the Tenergy 05 which I would not recommend for you given the control issues with it.So if you have a slightly harder sponge it tends to keep its arc and in practice is more consistent than a soft sponge.,irrelevant
3336,5f6c2b247da9e46ccbe154c5,Donic Barracuda or Tibhar Genius sound,So depending how you hit the Vega Europe may prove better to play with than the Vega Elite despite having the same throw rating.If you plan on sticking with your current stiff fast jpen blade I would be inclined to use a non tensor technology rubber for better control to allow better development.I've recommended the Stiga Magna TC II before.,irrelevant

4358,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,If you are still interested in the comparison Omega IV Pro is faster and spinnier than all Hexers.,irrelevant
4359,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,It is a touch too fast especially on a carbon blade and needs solid technique.,descriptive
4360,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,"The throw while blocking is low which is great and it is relatively insensitive to incoming spin.You could think of it as a Hexer HD with a touch softer and grippier topsheet, a softer sponge , more speed and spin.Like HD you really have to get some bat speed going and engage the sponge is you want that crazy spin.I use OIV Pro on my BH in max thickness.",comparative

4365,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,It's decent rubber but the sponge is a bit hard for my tastes and so I will soon be switching to Omega IV Europe.,irrelevant
4366,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,I have had a few brief hits with Hexer HD and found it fast enough but lacking in spin when looping.,irrelevant
4367,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Another player at our club (very strong -US2450-2500ish) had a similar problem with it.,irrelevant

4370,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Just posted a comparison for those two in another thread (exactly where they compare S1T and Hexer HD).,irrelevant

4376,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Both are excellent rubbers!,irrelevant
4377,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,Topsheet on Pro might be marginally softer but the sponge is even harder than on Asia whcih makes it really hard to do good attacking shots.,irrelevant
4378,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,In short game Pro might be better for flipping or non-flat game but that's not my bag (mostly not).,irrelevant
4379,5f6c2d3d7da9e46ccbe155fc,Hexer hd vs Xiom Omega 4 pro/asia,So for my style Asia is certainly preferable on both sides.,irrelevant

4661,5f6c2e757da9e46ccbe15648,Andro 450 vs calibra sound/spin,You are correct that tensors are generally bouncier than the old staples but I think it is just something you learn to adjust to after a short while.,irrelevant
