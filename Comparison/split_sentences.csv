0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,"Hi stao, the response of the T64fx changes depending on the the blade you're using"
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX, Usually I have a Primorac Carbon and I'm offensive player with agressive top spin
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX," I used T05fx before and I really appreciate the general feeling of the T64fx, which is more softer but faster than 05fx"
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX, On the other hand less spin too
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX, Very good for block
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX, For my style I really prefer T64fx than T05fx ( always 2
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,1 for me)
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,I bought recently the complete Garaydia family to see if from the blade I had a possibility to improve my skills and I would say no
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,"With the ALC it is too soft and slow for me, with the T5000 too fast and the ZLC has a softer touch and could be an alternative"
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX, I'm truly amazed about the huge difference between those 3 blades
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,To finish I'm currently glueing a Dignics 05 on my Primorac carbon to test as the season ended
0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX, after a training I'll see if it fits for me or if I have to test it with the garaydia T5000 or Garaydia ZLC as I'm seeking more spin
1,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I'm also interested
2,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,maybe TTD can start reviewing some sp rubbers?
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,I do not know if tabletennisdaily can reiview short pips
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, Think they need someone that know how to play with them
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, I think all three of them are considered grippy short pips so you can create some spin but there are less effect and deception
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2," 802 40 is not a rubber with inbuilt glue effect, think the two other are"
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2," So the two latter is proably a bit faster? I also think 802 40 is hardest, or atleast feel the the most hard"
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, Try google and you will find alot
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, Or ask at oaak tabletennis forum
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, They know more about pimples than guys here
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, How do you want to play and use your short pimple? Short pimple can be pretty different
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, Some good for one style and some better for another
4,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"I`ve used to play for several months with 802-40 2mm on 35 degree sponge heavy boosted,Also tested Impartial XS"
4,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, Both on shackehand BHTo me impartial XS reacts too much on incoming spin and flat hits were to predictable for my oponnet
4,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2, I suppose it is ok on CPen or as Forhand rubber
4,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"802-40 is very balanced but still feels a litle hard on touch shots,I suggest you to conisder Tutle Summer 3C it feels as upgraded 802-40- it is most balanced short pips i have ever tried"
5,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,"apolonia weight more, u can find between 85-90 gramsIF ZLC- 80-85I find Apolonia is more flexy and have softer outer ply and I love itand I think has better quality than IF ZLC too I find something special in Apolonia and this is the best blade right now if money is not the problem"
6,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,thanks Konrad
6,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC, Is the apalonia faster then the Innerforce?
7,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,Apolonia is also innerforce
8,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,If you want to save money
8,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,I think DHS fang bo ALC or DHS H301 is a good choices for you that It is the same innerforce with different outer ply Limba for fang bo and Koto for H301

10,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"If you loop everything and are active in the short game with spin manipulation, Tenergy 05"
10,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," If you block more and are a bit more passive in the short game, the more linear precision of T64 and T80 might be more to your liking"
11,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I'm not sure about that
11,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, I think T25FX is better than T64 for blocking and short game
11,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, I don't know anything about the T80 though
12,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Lifehack: buy T05 first, then once it wears out, buy T80, or vice versa"
12,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, This way you will learn by yourself how these rubbers play for you
12,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, And the difference between them is not that big so you can go from one to another with a minimal adjustment
13,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Depend on your skill
13,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, I like hard sponge so t05 is my favorite
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"The sponge on T05, T80, T64 and T25 is all the same"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, The difference is not the sponge
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, It is the pimple construction
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," T05 pimples are a little shorter, thicker, and closer together so the rubber feels harder"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, But even the rubber in the topsheet is the same
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, Just the pimple construction is different
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," To the OP, I would like to ask what he means by the word ""best"""
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," I won't comment on T25; but T05, T80 and T64 are all great rubbers"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, There are people whose game and style of play may work with one of them slightly better than the others
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, But they are all really great rubbers
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, There is a video that explains decently what the difference between each one is
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," Once I am able to search for it, I will post it here"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, But it has been posted to the forum many times already
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, That video should help you out a decent amount
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," To sum the info up simply:1) T05: Slower, More Spin, Higher Throw Angle"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," 2) T64: Faster, Less Spin, Lower Throw Angle"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, 3) T80: half way between T05 and T64
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," So do you want a bigger arc, more spin to spin the person off the table but a little sacrifice in speed? Or do you want lower shots that don't come up as much and are faster"
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, But with an amount of spin that is easier to counter
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, Or do you want to be half way in between the two extremes?I go with slower and more spin every time
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, Especially since T05 is more than fast enough

16,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Most people, including Butterfly reps, discuss T25 and T25FX as rubbers that are specialized Tenergies"
16,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," Most discussion is about T05, T64 and T80 as those are similar rubbers along a continuum"
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"With the term best, I mean actually the best experience with these rubbers"
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, The video mentioned I was actually familiar with
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, But it doesn't give much information about the touch of these series at the table
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, Tabletennis is not only about spinny topspin
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, For example how does each individual rubber reacts to spinny serves? I found that t05 is very sensitive to incoming spin and spinny serves
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, But T80 is less sensitive to it etc

18,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T25 is also a very-very good rubber, just a way different than other Tenergies and suits less people"
18,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," T80 has a little bit more control (for me), less sensitive to spin, but T05 is spinnier"
19,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Yes, but that is if you are into passive returns"
19,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," If you like to push and spin aggressively, the T05 reaction is a benefit"
19,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, It's when you try to just touch the serve without any acceleration that using T05 is a nightmare
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"And that term best is still about preference and each person will feel something slightly different is ""best"""
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," Like, for me, hands down, I like T05 more than the others for forehand"
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," For backhand T05, T64 and T05FX have all worked fine"
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, If I used it T80 may be fine as well
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80," But I remember when I tried it, I didn't try for that long and was used to T05FX and didn't give it much of a chance"
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80, The extra spin and higher throw seems to be more important to my forehand than my backhand

32,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria," I have one Clipper I could do it to, but, it is a bit too light so it doesn't really play like a REAL Clipper"
32,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, It is only 91 grams and the one I used to have that was 95 grams was sooooo much better
32,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, If we filled the handle on that one it would play amazing
32,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, 95 grams is a good weight for a blade
32,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria," Then if you have a Clipper that is 95 grams and you add 10 grams to the handle so it is handle heavy and weighs 105, that would play like a beast"
33,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I would take that joker BEYOND Beast
33,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Hey, that got a ring to it"
33,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, Maybe we just made a new international standard
34,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Take that Joker Beyond Beast
34,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, Let's do it
35,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"If I remember to toss in my wood glue into the TT bag, I can always depend on the Philly Goon Squad to quickly produce a sharp blade for me (to remove the handle)"
35,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria," I can always pick up small metal pieces from the sidewalks, that could count as sustainable management and neighborhood upkeep"
36,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I even have C clamps for clamping when gluing the handle back on
37,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I though that is why Carl was given two rows of teeth
37,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"I sometimes use a clamp, sometimes, just hold it in hand until it sets good enough then wrap grip tape over it and call it a day until it is set by the next day"
37,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"One time in Korea, I did this mod to one of the 896 Carl tried out and I played it 1 hr after I glued it back together, I used grip tape, it might be the one with Sigma Euro and H3"
38,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I bet leaving it clamped for a day would make it so you can glue it back perfectly and not be able to feel that it was taken apart
38,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, You don't need that because you like grip tape on your handle
38,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria, I like having wood with no grip tape

39,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,Wonderful post!
40,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too
40,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
41,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So if you like to win points of the serve you probably won't be that far back so I would go with tenergy 80 besides I don't like 64 as a backhand rubber anyway for me I would use it as a forehand rubber!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
42,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I would say that t80 is very fast
42,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, Too fast for me for BH especially with OFF blade
42,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," I would suggest t05fx, it is softer more control and less speed, but still not slow"
43,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I would say, play against any noob, and you can win your point off the serve"
43,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"But if you are going to be serious and play against people that knows how to return your serves, 3rd balls, and so on, then its more your style of play + skills/techinque + rubber"
43,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"By the sound of the above ""wishlist"" from you, your equipment is an overkillThe 2 rubbers you suggested is all good for serve, chopping, rallies etc"
43,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"T80 is more suited maybe for close to the table, while T64 can go further back"
43,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Other than that, it is really little difference for any player that is not ranked in the top level (in the top level, a 1% difference is a matter about winning and loosing)"
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,It is not only that
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," A lot of people like tenergy rubbers, especially those who played long time ago with Srivers boostes with a glue each training session"
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, The problem is that some blades which are very offensive makes the set up with tenergies not easy to control
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," What I mean is the problem with short push, service return and short spinny topspins"
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," Nowadays tactics are focused on playing short only with BH side, so we can say FH rubber can be very aggresive to make powerful and spinny topspin, while BH side should be more allround to be able playing pushes etc"
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, T05FX is much easier to control and if you take it with 1
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"9mm, it is great for everything"
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I wouldn't say that T80 is good for playing close
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, if you want to play close T05 if much better
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," T80 with different dimension of pips makes the ball going higher so it is much better to play further then T05, but I cannot compare it to T64 because I have never try it"
45,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,T64 has MUCH more spin than T80
46,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,why not tenergy 05 ?
47,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So what would the best rubber be for the BH?And is Tenergy 05 a good choice for a FH Rubber?Thank You everyone so far for your help
48,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I think, just go T05 on both sides"
48,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Timo Boll agrees btw 
49,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"As for the blade which is best suited?Timo boll spirit, ALC, ZLC OR ZLF"
50,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Jak, growing in level in TT is like playing Pokémon"
50,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," You gotta catch 'em all to win, so why not try 'em all and tell us what you think"
50,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, 
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I was going to say, start from Timo Boll All and work the way up"
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Otherwise I can always recommened the Timo Boll Spirit, since Mr Boll is using that with T05 on both sides, i'm sure Jak can end up in the world top 10 too with the exact same equipment"
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"Jak, how long are you in table tennis?Sounds to me you are looking at a way overkill equipment"
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"IMO, get a 2x rubbers + 1x blade at less than a price of those blades you have in question, and I'm sure that will be better for you"
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," Unless you think most expensive is the best, or fastest is the best, or spinnest is the best etc"
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"FZD stated that he doesn't like fast, he prefers more control equipment"
51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, A 16 year old wise kid I must add
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I've been playing for 3-4 years
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I currently have a Joola K5 Fast blade with Mambo H Rubber on both sides, Which is good all-round"
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,I want to upgrade my set-up
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,At college my mate has a Timo Ball Blade with Tenergy 05 FH AND sriver g3 BH which I Used and really enjoyed
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,When i was using The sriver in seemed to be alittle to slow and didn't have much spin and the control was nice
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"But I would like a Rubber on my back hand to have more speed, spin and good control too"
52,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Thats why I'm posting here because a certain amount of you have played with most rubbers and know which is better with which set-up ect
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,It seems your step is too big
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, Your current set up is quite strange
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, Most of people start with allround blade and then upgrade only the rubbers to faster
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," Final change to OFF blade is only for really advanced players, when they lack of speed with allround blade and off rubbers"
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, If you want to change everything I would suggest to choose OFF- setup
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," For instance blade Primorac JP OFF-, very good blade or Tibhar Stratus Powerwood"
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH, They are both OFF- blades but Tibhar is little bit faster
53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH," As to the rubbers if you want to choose Butterfly, you can take T05FX to your BH (you can trust me, it is the best choice from the Bty offer) and then it depends how do you play with you FH, if you play close you can take T05, if you like to play in distance you can take T80"
54,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"You can also try the XIOM rubbers - they are a long lasting good alternative to tenergy For example, I like to have a little harder rubber on the bh - thats why I take the PRO series there, but you could also try EUROPE for softer ones"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy and Baracuda are actually remarkably quite similar, despite the $25 difference per sheet"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy has a slightly higher throw angle than Baracuda, so looping heavy chops may be a little bit easier, with a greater arc on the ball"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," However, Baracuda still has a medium-high throw so they're both perfectly fine for looping"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," In my personal opinion, Baracuda has more spin than Tenergy, however it lacks a little bit of power and control compared to Ten"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good"

55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Just remember to keep your bat angle low
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Tenergy has many complaints of it being non-durable

55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," However, I've had my Tenergy 64 for about a few months now and it's looking fine"

55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Baracuda has never had complaints about it breaking easily, so Donic wins this one"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Maybe because the topsheet is a little bit harder
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"I can't really comment how easy either one is to use, since they're suited for different playing styles"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," If driving's your thing, use Tenergy"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," If long, spinny rallies is how you tend to lean towards, Baracuda would be a better rubber"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," They're both very good rubbers in my opinion, though I would use Baracuda over Tenergy, because it is closer to my style of play"
55,5f686c800ae0898b9220ac59,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"In conclusion, Ten has higher throw angleTen is heavier Ten is more sensitive to incoming topspin, though can be adjusted with blade or sponge layerBara is much more durable (according to reviewers)I also personally think that Baracuda is a much better rubber in terms of worth for money"

61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy and Baracuda are actually remarkably quite similar, despite the $25 difference per sheet"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy has a slightly higher throw angle than Baracuda, so looping heavy chops may be a little bit easier, with a greater arc on the ball"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," However, Baracuda still has a medium-high throw so they're both perfectly fine for looping"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," In my personal opinion, Baracuda has more spin than Tenergy, however it lacks a little bit of power and control compared to Ten"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Just remember to keep your bat angle low
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Tenergy has many complaints of it being non-durable
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Some reviewers claim that with only a few days of playing with it, obvious cracks were in the rubber on the side"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," However, I've had my Tenergy 64 for about a few months now and it's looking fine"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Just don't throw it around on the table
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Baracuda has never had complaints about it breaking easily, so Donic wins this one"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, Maybe because the topsheet is a little bit harder
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"I can't really comment how easy either one is to use, since they're suited for different playing styles"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," If driving's your thing, use Tenergy"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," If long, spinny rallies is how you tend to lean towards, Baracuda would be a better rubber"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda," They're both very good rubbers in my opinion, though I would use Baracuda over Tenergy, because it is closer to my style of play"
61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"In conclusion, Ten has higher throw angleTen is heavier Ten is more sensitive to incoming topspin, though can be adjusted with blade or sponge layerBara is much more durable (according to reviewers)I also personally think that Baracuda is a much better rubber in terms of worth for money"

62,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda, it surprises me that Ten05 is less durable(price) and less spinny then the Baracuda

69,5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani," So after cutting it out, I assume, the difference would probably be 3g then"
69,5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,3g for both side is equal to 6g
69,5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,I suppose 6g makes a SIGNIFICANT difference for smaller sized guy like me

72,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,Fxp is more of a direct sponge compression type of contact
72,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops, Elp would be better if you brush
73,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,Thanks!
74,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,FX-P has a grippier topsheet and softer sponge than EL-P and is comparable to the Tenergy FX series
74,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops, I personally felt EL-P was better for blocking and FX-P for looping
74,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops, EL-P felt a little too passive
75,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,and i'm in square one again probably I will choose el-p as it's quite a bit cheaper in a place when I'm going to buy that rubber from
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,I haven't tried fx-p but used el-p on backhand for a couple of years
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops," It worked perfectly on a Off- allwood blade, but when I changed to a off- 5+2 blade with carbon/kevlar next to the inner ply, I had some problems with it"
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops, In those soft/slow topspin hits it gripped the ball very inconsistently
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops, Sometimes it would behave normally as before and sometimes it would throw very high
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops, So it depends on how flexible your blade is
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops," From the description of the fx-p(it should be closer to mx-p, just softer), I don't think it will have the same problem on a stiffer blade"
77,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,"I'm not surprised, felt the same thing"
78,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,Sorry
78,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops," If it's a quite a bit cheaper, get EL-P, it's by all means a good BH rubber"
79,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,I play on 5ply all wood blade (dhs pg3)

88,5f68727510fb22f7fce1f881,Stiga genesis m vs mantra m on bh, Mantra M is supposed to be easier to handle
88,5f68727510fb22f7fce1f881,Stiga genesis m vs mantra m on bh, I have it on one of my blades for the moment and must say it is very controllable

94,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05," t05 being less spinny than GA 8 seems a bit unlikely to me, having tried both"
94,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05," I liked GA 8, but I thought it was a bit like Donic bluefire M1"
94,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05," However, you might find it easier to generate spin with GA 8, while t05 has a higher maximum that not everybody can activate"

99,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, However O7P is a little bit lacking in grip if compared to tenergy or Rasanter
99,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, This is why I'm a little bit hesitant
100,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Really? I found Omega 7 to be one of the few with more grip than tenergy

100,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, Tibhar Hybrid K1 is excellent stuff
101,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,that lack of grip is good for not sensitive to spin so u can counter easier dna idk at all
102,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,I agree with above
102,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, After playing O7P for a few weeks I was quite disappointed for its low spin
102,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?," Control, feel and speed are all fine"
102,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, But spin is quite lacking compared to other rubbers at the same price range
102,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"However, O7P is awesome if you want a rubber not too sensitive to incoming spin"
103,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,You have to dig through the sponge in order to get spin

105,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,why? Please explain
106,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"I had chance to play Vicky + DNA PRO M on both sides and I think DNA PRO M is perfect on bh but on fh too soft, I had chance to play OA7 and OE7, OP7 and you can read here that I really like Asia because you can generate good spin with nice arc"
106,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?," OE7 is good on bh but rubber is more for amateurs, safety shots, slower, forgive errors etc"
106,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Omega 7 pro is not very good on Viscaria and Omega 7 Pro is very good on Joola Quadri Aruna
106,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, Sometimes rubbers have different feeling on different blades and if you like your viscaria
107,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,How do you know that OP does not like the same feeling as you? Maybe he would love O7P on viscaria and hate it on Joola Quadry Aruna
107,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, You probably shouldnt post subjective advices misleading people

111,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,for me you can buy whatever you like so buy omega VII pro and dont make an uproar
112,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,I see
112,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, Thank you for your insight 
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,I believe firmly that it is important to know what category and softness/firmness of sponge you need to play the kind of shots a player does given his/her impact
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"O7P could be great for a player on BH, and I would play much better (hit faster, spinier shots) with a slower control rubber that is kinda on the soft side"
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, Last tourney I had unboosted/unglued Nittaku Hammond (the old school inverted rubber) in 2
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,0 on BH and was simply a beast of BH the last tourney
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I could give my bat and rubber to another player my levels and that player may so hate on the entire bat
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"It comes down to how you make impact and what shots you are trying to do, then knowing what is more suitable"
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,it is next to impossible to say that without having been around a player and be on the other side as the player tries different rubbers on same blade and you feel and see what that player is doing
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"It isn't so cut and dried as asking if this rubber is ""better"" for FH or BH"
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Watch Dan and Tom as they do video reviews of equipment
113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,ALWAYS it is a DYNAMIC test of the shots they do with their kind of impacts
114,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Man he can put every rubber on different blade and take 2-3 days to know how equipment work this is dynamic test ? no pressure and you can play whatever you want with superstar just to show how well rubber is working on 20 minutes video

114,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Why? Because it's business
114,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, So for me DNA pro M is more like Rasanter 47 big brother than OP7 because its not from the same place factory so I know something more than this is better because it's better and that's allXiom Omega 7 Pro is good rubber but I think V Tour is their best work and this is only my word
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"I know my kind of impact (how I strike the ball) and I am not great with a firm sponged dynamic rubber in most shot situations, except for couterlooping medium to fast loops"

115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, but have significantly harder time doing the other tasks I do more frequently
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, That is my FH wing
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?," My BH wing has a lot of variety of shots possible, but at the end of the day, softer dynamic rubbers, or slower older softer rubbers give me more consistency in landing percentage and my power shots on that wing do not lack power or control"

115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I am basically a get it into the topsheet gentle-like and accelerate kind impact hitting guy
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, that means a topsheet with a pimple structure that is easy to bend pips/wrap topsheet around ball and a softer dynamic sponge (or a linear one on low/med end) is my sweet spot
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Understanding that about myself helps me select equipment that works for what I do
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,I think this kind of understanding of self is important
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,I have tried both O7Tour and DNA Pro M
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I did not like either for my general FH
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I did not like either for my BH
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, but that was ME and my opinion about what was suitable for my way of striking the ball

115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I have them trout several different classes of equipment and rubbers and sponge hardness and can see quickly the improvement or degrade in quality
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,That is how you I can get someone to realize the class of equipment suitable for them

115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, MX-K is the first rubber to come to mind with similar properties on the low to medium impacts

119,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I think if you find Asia is too hard and Hyper is 5 degrees harder (this is hardness difference between O7E and O7P) then I think might feel like it is too hard despite the factory boost
120,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Hyper is very hard and feels like a 41 degree Hurricane 3 in the backhand
120,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, It is a high performance rubber that needs high level of skills
120,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I am settled with the O7A as a bh rubber
121,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"Why do you prefer O7A over o7p? In practice it feels better, but Im afraid in real match where you dont always get perfect timing it might be too hard?"
122,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,Because 07A still has some topsheet softness left and I prefer it to have better control than Hyper
122,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I may have spinnier pushes and loops with Hyper but I have better ball control with O7A
123,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"no yogi, Asia vs Pro on backhand"
123,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, Why do you prefer Asia on backhand instead of Pro?
124,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"Oh sorry, i did not see the O7P"
124,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, O7P seem to soft for my BH
124,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?, I brush a lot so i like a harder rubber
125,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,I use skyline tg2 neo for both forehand and backhand on a pg7 shakehand
125,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO," It produces huge spin, but speed-wise you must have excellent forearm acceleration on your loops to get the best out of it"
125,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, It starts off with high throw but will gradually lower to medium-low
125,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO," Initially out of the packet, it is very tacky but after my first time cleaning it, it lost most of the tack"
125,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO," If you are a mid-distance looper, this rubber is not for you- it is a monster in the close game but when I take a step back my loops fly into the net because of the low throw"

127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,Revival!So
127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, anyone between 7 years ago and now have any input on H3 Neo vs
127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, TG2 Neo?My impressions are (TG2 vs
127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, H3) that TG2:-Has lower throw angle and thus smaller margin for error
127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, -Has more Spin potential (especially at harder shots); H3 seems to be generally spinnier in low input shots
127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, -Is a bit slower overall but has a higher ceiling for bottoming out this potentially can be faster/spinnier with the right stroke
127,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, -has better feel for me; I can keep my pushes lower and place most shots with more accuracy as long as Im taking care of the lower throw

128,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,Agree with all your points
128,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, At the amateur level many people including myself aren't trained to unleash the top speed/spin of TG2
128,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, Therefore I usually played worse with TG2 than with H3
128,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO," When I just start training with full energy, I train with TG2"
128,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, My topspin is clearly too much for many club members
129,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,"So what do you end up playing with now? TG2 or H3?Its so true, the harder you engage the rubber/sponge, the better it feels and the better the results"
129,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO," Is that a good thing? Teaches me to be aggressive, but I need to find that balance of controlled power"
129,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO," In any case, TG2 is more fun for me to play with than H3"
129,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, The feeling and almost specialty characteristics of it
129,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, just kind of cool for me

130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,"I have used both Hurricane 3 NEO and Skyline TG2 NEO, mostly the softest (H39) sponge"
130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, H3N tends to go long for me often
130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, TG2 is a little bit slower and better control I think
130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, I actually tried Yinhe Big Dipper and have stuck to this since last autumn
130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, It gives me a little more control than TG2 and still makes my loops vicious
130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, 
131,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,I have used all the common DHS rubbers
131,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, DHs H3 Neo is my prefered rubber with H2 Neo being second
131,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, H2 Neo works well for the BH but right now I have H2 Neo mounted on the FH of my Firewall+ paddles that I use for push blocking
131,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO, H2 works well enough for close to the table play

134,5f6872f110fb22f7fce1f8b6,DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) vs the NEO version of it,National and provincial versions of Hurricane 3 are widely available to public now
134,5f6872f110fb22f7fce1f8b6,DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) vs the NEO version of it," In China, DHS even has an official Taobao store selling them"
135,5f6872f110fb22f7fce1f8b6,DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) vs the NEO version of it,"I think if you are gonna be paying the money for the ""national"" version, might be better to do the boosting yourself, would at least learn what is the best condition for you and how much booster is needed for that condition"
136,5f6872f110fb22f7fce1f8b6,DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) vs the NEO version of it,"Neo has a more modern sponge for the plastic ball, it will provide more power and control"
137,5f6872f110fb22f7fce1f8b6,DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) vs the NEO version of it,Could you share the link please?
138,5f6872f110fb22f7fce1f8b6,DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) vs the NEO version of it,I guess the only difference is Neo factory boosted and the other not boosted

147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,I use Mantra M red in max on forhand on a Sanwei Fextra blade
147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, And im really impressed about it
147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M," I tried ALOT of rubbers maybe about 10 rubbers like Tenergy 05, Razka 7, Andro Rasanter R 47 and so on"
147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,But with Mantra M i really enjoying playing

147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, The spin is amacing in opening loops with a lower speed but ALOT of spin when i brushes the rubber
147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, In serving its Fantastic
147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,For my style of playing its the BEST fh rubber ever
147,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, Im hoping it will never go out of production
148,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Can you say more about the difference between rakza 7 and Mantra M ? I hesitate between both
149,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,GoldArc should be somewhat spinnier but i like the Mantra M as a bh rubber better because it is not spin sensitive abd it is more bouncy
150,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,I really fell every Ball on the racket crisp and controlling both active and passive shots with Manta M
150,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,The rubber doesnt surprice you wtih catapult effect

150,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Razka 7 is also a okay rubber
150,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, Much more spin sensitive than Mantra M
150,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, Thinking Razka 7 is a older type of modern rubber
151,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Mantra M is japanese made, GA8 is german made"
151,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Just by that it is easy to say Mantra is more linear, has better topsheet and lasts longer"
152,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I somewhat like this reasoning from principles, but still don't subscribe to its conclusion"
153,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Not sure about that
153,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M," Played with the 47,5 degree version a while ago and thought it was really good, comparable to bluefire/Evolution and co"

154,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Mantra like other Daiki made rubbers still has lesser spin compared to ESN rubbers though if you ask me which i prefer overall, i would go with the Mantra"
155,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,that's ok
155,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M," From my experience, it is mostly true though"
155,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, ESN rubbers have more factory tuning and perform significantly worse after 2-3 months
156,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I think I glued on my GA8/50 early july, and am nearing that mark (with about 10-12 hours of play in a good week)"
156,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M," You did rouse my interest in Mantra, but I'm not done with my little infatuation with a hardish FH rubber just yet so might give Mantra H a thought or two"
156,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, Hopefully I'll come across somebody playing it
157,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Mantra H is actually a pretty decent rubber for fh
157,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, It is faster than a lot of esn rubbers
157,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, I like it as a bh rubber
157,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, It packs a punch
158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Even more of a punch than GA8 at 50º does? That's already quite punchful to me
158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,But that's not what I like most about it
158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M," The best part (to me) is not the availability of the high gears, but the lack of bounciness in the lower gears"

158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, This helps a lot
158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, Is Mantra (esp
158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M, H) like that also?
159,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I think mantra h is really fast but as expected from a fast rubber, the gears are less compared to a 50 degree rubber"

165,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings, They are purely based on user ratings and you could see how this can already be a disaster because the majority of the users don't have adequate trainings and thus aren't equipped to rate anything properly

174,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,Thanks @RidTheKidI have tried Vega China
174,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, It's a great half tacky rubber Xiom produced
174,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, Nice control and good spin
174,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, I just feel it lacks the powerful kick H3 has when you do power loop
174,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, So I thought the high end Omega VII might offer a better sponge
174,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, And when they released the O7 Asia I naturally speculated the topsheet might be tacky

177,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,A boosted battle 2 39-40 hardness and boosted 2 layers would do the trick

180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,I've used Battle II provincial
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, I think Battle II is a bit overrated and I would stick with H3 which has a solid track record after many years in the market
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3," If a person's style suits Chinese tacky rubber, I'd say look no further than H3/H3N provincial"
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, Forget any other tacky rubbers or hybrid euro/Chinese rubbers out there because they really just don't live up to H3 at the end of the day
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,"Get the 39 (40 if you are very well advanced, 41 if you are insane) degree in hardness and boost it a couple of layers and you are set"
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, Omega VII Asia would be a modern tensor rubber that plays completely differently from H3
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3," It may be slightly less bouncier and offers somewhat more control than other tensor rubbers, but it would never replace H3"
181,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,Because I can control H3 way better
181,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, I am using vega china as a bh rubber now

189,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,For those who say Battle 2 Provincial is better than H3 Provincial are definitely low level players
189,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,H3 has much better spin (like 2x of b2) and control
189,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3," However when boosted/speed glued properly, B2 Provincial is still playable and is a cheaper alternative than H3P"

189,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, I use speed glue and reglue every time before I play
189,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, There's no bubble or topsheet peeled off from the sponge which I had several times with H3p

190,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3, I've boosted it twice now over a span of several months

213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,I have used both
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The Hadou 40+ is tackier than the AK47 series of rubbers and it does grip the ball better IMO
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The AK47 has more bounce and speed
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," If you have ever used the Stiga Genesis M rubber, the AK47 Yellow is a slightly harder and faster version"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Though, the Genesis M has better grip"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Actually, the Genesis M feels closer to the AK47 Blue"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I often find the AK47 rubbers allow the ball to slip and lose grip (this may be blade dependent)
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, If you need a light rubber to balance out a setup it is worth a try
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,The Hadou 40+ is a nice rubber

213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The response and feeling is otherwise similar to Battle 2
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," It is a good middle ground rubber, a do everything rubber"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," It is not a fast rubber, more of a high control rubber"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I found that the Hadou 40+ rubber is a good rubber to put on blades that have too much bounce / catapult for your game
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I found the Hadou 40+ to be one of the best rubbers to put on the Sanwei F3 Pro (innerforce alc version)
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, This was a very bouncy blade for me and the Hadou 40+ tamed it very nicely
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The last time I tried that blade I ran Battle 2 on the FH and Hadou 40+ on the BH
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, My only issue with that setup is there was no feeling at all
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Otherwise, it offered good control and was still very fast"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Keep in mind, I am more of a beginner to the game, and I play closer to the table due to limited space in my playing locations"
213,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Hope this helps
214,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"Thank you for explaining, it does help"
214,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I am currently using Stiga Mantra M and H which AFAIK are the descendants of Genesis so then the AK47 line would be comparable with these? With the the Hadou being slower although supposedly designed for the heavier balls if I understand correctly
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,AK-47 is totally non-tacky
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, It's basically an attempt at a euro style rubber
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, Hadou is a typical tacky rubber
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, Yinhe Jupiter II (38 degree) is my favorite tacky rubber
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Way easier to use (and better non boosted performance) than Hadou, Hurricane 3 Neo, and the rest"
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," (Haven't tried Battle II yet, but it's not as easy to use as Jupiter II from what I have heard"
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,)
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I'm not sure how I feel about AK-47
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I have the blue version on backhand and I don't get that much spin with it
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I like CJ8000 Biotech better
215,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, (It's semi-tacky)

216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"I have never tried Mantra, so cannot compare"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I don't think the Genesis and Mantra are that close in playing characteristics
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," The AK47 might be more comparable to the Genesis II, since it was so close to the original Genesis"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, AK47 is faster then original Genesis just like the Genesis II is
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The AK47 has less overall grip for sure
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," One thing, for what ever reason I found the AK47 to work very well for opening up on backspin balls"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, Better than the Genesis in this regard
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, Genesis was better for topspins though
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"Yeah, the Hadou 40+ is a slower rubber with a medium to medium-low throw"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, Offers good grip and good spin
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Works well on some blades, and is too slow on others"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I have used Rakza 7 on most of my setups
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, It is just the first decent rubber that I chose
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," I am comfortable with it, so it is my go to (the 4-3 price on TT11 helps)"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," In the past, if I ever put Rakza 7 on a blade and it was too fast, too lively"
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I could fix that by putting on a sheet of Hadou 40+
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,I can agree that the Hadou 40+ is easier to use than the Battle 2
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," If I was to keep using that Sanwei F3 Pro, I would have put Hadou 40+ on both sides and removed the Battle 2"
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,I also agree that the AK47 rubbers lack spin
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," For example, I have used the AK47 Blue and Genesis M on a DHS H301 blade"
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The AK47 Blue was a little bit faster than the Geneis M
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," The sponge softness felt very similar, it just had a little more speed"
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The AK47 Blue was better at lifting backspin balls on both the FH and BH side
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," However, I can consistently generate more topspin with the Genesis M"
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, This is for both FH and BH topspins
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, The AK47's just do not feel stable to me on topspins
218,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Mantra and Genesis are completely different rubbers
218,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Mantra is ""made in Japan"" and Genesis is OEM manufactured by DHS"
218,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Mantra is a tensor type rubber
218,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Genesis (and Genesis II) is a hybrid rubber (chinese top sheet with European like high tension sponge)
218,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Both are extremely different to any version of AK47
219,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"The construction may be different, but IMO, the overall play of Genesis M and AK47 Blue is similar"
219,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, On my H-301 blade anyway

220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,They are very different rubbers
220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," For me, the AK47 series are speed oriented rubbers while the Hadou40+ is spin oriented"
220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, It doesn't feel like a typical chinese tacky rubber
220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Overall it's a little softer, the topsheet is very different and the sponge has a different texture than B2 or H3"
220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow," Out of the package is not very fast, however it has a very strong reaction to booster and becomes a totally different rubber"
220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, It's more forgiving than B2 or H3 and you can even get that clicking sound typical of tensors
221,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Interesting stuff
221,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, I ended up ordering the Jupiter II and AK47 Yellow to try out
221,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, Julian
222,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,ak47 lacks the punching power that battle 2 has got
222,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,ak 47 red and blue sponge kinda sucks imo lacks something that the yellow has 
222,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow, also big dipper is a option
223,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yeah, this sums G1 v Baracuda up very well"
223,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," G1 is pretty close to the ever-popular, dearly-departed Adidas P7"
223,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," G1 is definitely faster than Baracuda, pretty much equal in spin on stronger strokes"
223,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Baracuda gives more spin on lower-effort shots though, which makes it more spin sensitive as well, as you've mentioned"
224,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),baracuda is less durable
224,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It easily chips at the side of the topsheet
225,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),so what does this mean for opening up backspin balls with an attack
225,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),is it easier with the baracuda due to its higher spin on low attack balls oris it easier with the fastarc due to the amount of spin which is to override
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),This depends on your technique and habits IMO
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," I tend to be aggressive when opening up off backspin so they're pretty much as easy as each other, but I got a faster ball with G1"
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," On ""softer"" openers, Baracuda seemed to generate a higher arc so it was easier in that sense"
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Don't overthink it too much
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), The main difference is that G1 is a bit faster
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Quite similar overall, both good rubbers"
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Yogi's point about durability is a good one too
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),for me as a beginner the spin-sensivity is a big factor
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), recieves are a big winning condition
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),if i could have quite a similar rubber like Baracuda but with an improved chance of avoiding recieve errors then i would do the change
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), i choosed the Barauda as my daily rubber because i can do lazy backspin into topspin attack as well as hard shots
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), with H3 and other hard°rubbers i only could do hard shots
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),thus this aspect is also important
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),btw Andy: u choosed R47 as ur primary rubber
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), may u give me a short comparison between it and g1/bara please
228,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I have a Kid that plays with Baracuda, as he is a chopper, I chose that rubber for him, he can attack very agressively with more spin than the older better players that use M1, or even tenergy, the ball comes really heavy"
228,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),He can still chop with the FH and is a very difficult shot to top spin
228,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I love that rubber, and with a little bit of booster, is the best"
228,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"stay with baracuda, it's great"
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),R47 is really different
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," G1 and Baracuda are from a similar ESN release cycle, have a lot of similar properties"
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Rasanter is more recent - you get a matte topsheet, less catapult, more linearity (and for me, a better feeling of ""grab"" on the plastic ball, but not everyone agrees with that)"
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Add to that a lower arc and it's a different proposition
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It needs more effort to list backspin for sure
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), But I don't like the older ESN rubbers with the plastic ball - otherwise I'd probably be using G1 (in the absence of Adidas P7)
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"That said, I'm not the best person to ask about why I'm using my current setup"
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," I change my rubber too often, so I'm not totally committed to anything you see in my signature"
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), I'm looking very closely at a few new semi-tacky hybrid rubbers at the moment so it could all change in a flash
230,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If you're prepared to use booster and don't mind the faff, this is a good shout too"
230,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Baracuda is cheap(ish) too!
231,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I have club members playing with years-old Baracuda
231,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," They don't look fresh, somewhat stained, but still generate tons of spin, and are not crumbling away at the edges"
231,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Well, aside from the expected damage to rubber as well as blade after clipping the table"
232,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Indeed
232,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Which is why I think it´s quite funny that over on German TT News some people now treat G1 as the answer to all questions and a serious alternative to tenergy
232,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), If that generation (or any 
232,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),") had been, the news would´ve spread earlier "
233,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I think it is because some JNT members use it
233,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Also, the new ball has made that generation more playable across the board even Hexer and Genius"
234,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),The Fastarc G-1 is an absolute oddity
234,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It was released in July 2010, so over 2 years after Tenergy and close to 1 year after Baracuda/Hexer/Genius/X-plode"
234,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Unlike the others that started with a bang and then sank into oblivion, Fastarc G-1 has been in and out the top 10 of Table Tennis Kingdom sales ranking during the last years of 40mm, and only really became a best-seller well after the switch to the 40+(July, 2014)"
234,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," It's going strong in the ABS era(April, 2017) and has been at the top for the past 2 years except for 2 months, when Rozena temporarily dethroned it in Aug and Sep 2017"
235,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),May I throw in Vega Pro
235,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I had both VP and Baracuda on same blade
235,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Baracuda was miles ahead for me
235,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Don't get the hype of it as a Tenergy clone
236,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Vega pro is not comparable to baracuda but rather Acuda S2
236,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), I think Sigma 2 pro is closer to baracuda
237,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"In terms of sponge hardness, would the Rasanter R42 be closest to the Baracuda/G1?"
238,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"As the name suggests, the R42 has a sponge hardness of 42° on the ESN-scale (I think they use Shore A), whereas the G-1 has a sponge hardness of 47"
238,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"5°, so that's a rather significant difference"
238,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), The R47 would be closer (if we're only talking about sponge hardness)
239,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yes, absolutely"
239,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),There will never be a good direct comparison between Baracuda and the Rasanter series - the whole rubber composition is just too different
239,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," The new Hexers might be a closer match, if you want something new"
240,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If someone is used to using Tenergy 05, should they try the R47 out of the Rasanter series? How does the R47 and Tenergy 05 compare?"
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If you absolutely had to pick a Rasanter to replace T05, it would be R47 yes"
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), But they aren't that close
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," IMO R47 is more linear, easier to use, much better blocking and flat hitting, less sensitive to spin"
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), But it's also lower arc and you have to put your own muscle into the stroke to get good spin out
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It rewards committed strokes with good performance
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," T05 is generally more spinny across a whole range of gears but has all the usual T05 demands - spin sensitivity, catapult, price"
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," R47 is the better rubber for my needs, but it's a personal decision rather than R47 being a T05 clone or something like that"
242,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Fantastic thanks Andy I needed that sort of review/comparison
242,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," How does R47 play away from the table in looping, counter looping and fishing? Also how is it for close to the table attacking and serving? I presume it's quite good in the short game compared to Tenergy 05?How would the R47 play on a Joo Se Hyuk blade would it suit?Lastly, what differences do I get from different sponge thicknesses with the R47?"
243,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It's very likely ESN use Asker C, which has a spherical indenter"
243,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," DHS use Shore A, which has a truncated cone indenter"
243,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Because of that, simple translation and direct comparison between the 2 scales are prone to error and not recommended"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Away from the table looping - it's OK
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Spin is good but from distance you have to pay attention to the arc because it stays lower than some of its peers
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Counterlooping - excellent
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It's very stable and forgiving of timing/power errors
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Counter tends to stay low and nasty
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Fishing - not really my bag, hard to comment"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Close-in - it's solid
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Great for flicks, close counters, basic drives"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Because it's a bit inert compared to, say, MX-P, you have to muscle backspin openers a bit more than livelier rubbers"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Serving is OK but I needed to make some adjustments to get good spin on short serves - needs care to avoid sending the serve into the middle zone
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Much easier in the short game, blocking, than T05 for me"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It's easier and more predictable in general
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," But if you're used to T05 and happy with the way it plays, you'd probably find R47 a bit dead and lifeless"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It's all a very personal experience
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),I haven't used a Joo so can't say for sure
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), If you send me a PM I can send you a gently-used sheet of R47 in black ultramax to try out if you want
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Might be a bit small for the Joo headsize though
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Thickness - R47 has the new-ish thin topsheet/thicker sponge concept so plays a bit softer than you might expect with 47
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),5 hardness
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), I use Ultramax on the FH at the mo and it gives a little more catapult and more headroom when playing harder shots to get spin out of it
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Thinner sponges (in general, IMO) tend to play a touch harder, less catapulty, more direct, and you sacrifice top-end spin for a little more straight-line speed"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," So Max to support looping, thinner for driving/hitting I would say"
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),These things tend to be very personal impressions and YMMV
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Best to try it out if you can
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Only way to be sure!
245,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"You are correct, zeio"
245,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), ESN uses C; I mixed it up
246,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),so guys i need to replace my rubber due to deterioration
246,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"is it worth to try out the g1 as baracuda fan?i am afraid that with harder sponge it will be much less comfort in doing all kind of shots well, esp opening up backspin"
247,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Andy, I don't suppose you still have the R47 do you? PM me!"
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Moving between rubber hardness levels is more difficult than moving between rubber brands/types
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), It's a huge difference
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),But you won't know till you try
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda)," Yes, it will be harder to perform shots you rely on, lifting backspin especially will be harder, but on the other hand, if you have the physical power for it, the harder rubbers will perform better and pressure opponents more with more speed and spin"
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"That said, just replacing rubbers isn't a magic spell, you won't get any of that extra speed and spin unless you're fit and have great technique"
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda), Without all that you'll just have a lot less speed and spin
249,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"When I wanted to choose rubbers, I tried them both from teammates"
249,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I'm intermediate and haven't tried many rubbers at all
249,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Both where tested on an innerforce alc blade for one session of 2 hours each
249,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," For me and my skills, mxs was rock hard and quite uncontrollable, but very fast and very spinny I'd say"
249,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"Rakza was fast too, but not so fast, it was quite spinny too, maybe a little less than mxs but can't be sure about that, and I could control it quite easily"
249,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"I would like to state again that my level is much lower than most players here and probably I can't review the whole potential of the rubbers, I'm just saying my experience"
250,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Mxs is spinnier but feels harder
250,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," Also, mxs is much more durable"
251,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Try rakza 7 soft
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I'm not sure why Yogi says mxp is more durable
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Rakza7 is about 4 times as durable than anything in the Evolution series
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"Anyway, MX-P is faster and better for direct play"
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Rakza7 is spinnier
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,But a lot of it depends on synergy with the blade
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Both are difficult rubbers
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Try something else
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Rakza7 soft is an awesome suggestion
253,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,MX-S not MX-P
253,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,MX-S is known to be a very durable rubber
253,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Rakza 7 just an average ESN rubber on that regard
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"You're right, MX-S is better than MX-P, where the booster effect wears off pretty fast and it becomes eh"
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,But MX-S is less durable than rakza7 also
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I used MX-S for 2 sheets
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It kept fraying around the edges and sort of crumbling
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Granted this is my experience but I've read from quite a few others that this is indeed a tendency of the evolution series
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"It may be considered durable because the sponge is hard, but Rakza7 has a sponge about as hard only with a lasting topsheet"
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Rakza is much better than those newer synthetic rubbers
255,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"If you are choosing between Rakza 7 and MX-S, compromise with Fastarc G1"
255,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I think it has good things from both rubbers
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I have a TB-ALC
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," I have had S2, MX-S and Rakza 7 2mm on both sides"
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, The S2 played well but I felt it was too soft for the FH
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I tried MX-S because it was harder
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It wasn't bad but it just didn't feel right
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, The rubber shrank on the blade
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I was not happy about that
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I like Rakza 7
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It seems to be between S2 and MX-S
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"BTW, I have a c-pen YEO with Rakza 7 soft max on it"
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," I have posted video me playing c-pen with it on the ""how many c-pen players are there"" thread"
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Rakza 7 soft max is very spinny as demonstrated in the video
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,i don't see a need for Rakza 7 max unless you play far from the table and really need to hit hard often without worrying about bottoming out the sponge
257,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,These two rubbers don't work well on the new ABS ball
257,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Go for MXP instead
257,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Spinnier and faster
257,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Go for Gewo Nexxus EL pro 48 which gives really good feel with crazy speed and spin
258,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Actually mxs was designed for the polyball and is newer than mxp
259,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Where can I purchase it? On tabletennis11 the black 2

266,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I agree
266,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Slower really means more linear with less catapult
266,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I really don't like the catapult of Vega Pro either so I prefer G1 to it as well
267,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I thought u used to play with MX-S?
268,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I did
268,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," I also used to play with Karis M and Tenergy 05 too, remember? Even did a brief stint with Genius"
268,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,But I wanted something that suited my current game after taking a 9 month hiatus
268,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," To cut a long story short, Fastarc G1 is now being sold at reasonable prices in Europe and I gave it a shot and loved it"
269,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,What about it do you like so much?In comparison to MX-S for example? To who would you recommend it?
270,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"Hey NextLevel,Since G1 is harder than R7, do you have to actually hit harder to engage a bit more sponge to create a safer attack with an arching topspin?Did you have to adjust your stroke at all from R7 to G1?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"I wrote a review but I would say that G1 is the best rubber of the ESN generation that includes Baracuda, Hexer, Genius, Xplode, Vega Pro etc"
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,It is for people who want durable spinny rubbers and aren't necessarily looking for the fastest stuff
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It has Tenergy like throw angles but with less speed and better blocking characteristics as it is less spin sensitive from the sponge catapult
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," But the price for value is where it really shines as you can get 4 sheets for roughly $120, making it a bargain in this era of overpriced rubbers which may suit pros but does nothing for amateurs"
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I think it can suit a wide variety of players - it definitely isn't as much work as MX-S to use
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I know a guy who couldn't use anything but Tenergy until he used G1
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It feels hard when it starts but it gets softer and the topsheet is very very grippy
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It takes much less effort to get heavy spin
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,G1 is very easy to brush with
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?," The topsheet is very grippy, almost like Chinese rubber"
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It is slower than Tenergy and only a little slower than Rakza 7 but I never played Rakza 7 for extended period
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, My club mate who did said he preferred G1 and thought it was an improved Razka 7 when he tested it ( and this was without my asking for that comparison)
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, He uses a Tenergy right now but just liked G1 for the control
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, I can play very slow spinny loops during warmup without much effort - that is how grippy G1 topsheet is and how easy it is to spin with it
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, Again it may not be for everyone but lots of people will like it if they try it
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, It is the most popular rubber in Japan for good reason
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,A lot of these rubbers while old play better with plastic than with celluloid
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?, G1 is one of them
273,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Thanks for the info

277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),The underlying philosophies are still too different
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"Of course, you may achieve a similar performance, or in other words play just as well with a Tensor rubber"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," The feeling on ball contact will never be the same, though"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"If you want the closest feeling to tenergy05, you might want to try Stiga Mantra M - made in Japan, not a Tensor (German) by definition, but a great rubber"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"If you want to try a Tensor rubber again, you might want to opt for a newer generation"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," Many people have switched to Tibhar Evolution MX-P (due to clever marketing thinking it was Japanese, which at that time was still all the rage), with bluefire M1 and Rasant (turbo/PowerGrip) being quite similar"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," There are quite a few more rubbers that have served people well, such as XIOM Vega pro, a currently (due to recommendation from a pro) discovered GEWO Hype EL and of course all the new stuff like Rasanter, Aurus Prime (probably the closest in feeling to tenergy05) or GEWO Nexxus"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," As for the comparison of Baracuda to Genius, they are pretty close siblings from the same generation, but I found the Baracuda a bit easier to play (softer topsheet/sponge)"
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," I would not spend money on Genius (otherwise on itself an excellent rubber, make no mistake) just to find that they are quite similar"
278,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),The newest tensor generation (Rasanter/Rhyzer/
278,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),) are spinnier and bouncier than all old tensors
278,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," In fact, I found Rhyzer to be spinnier than MX-P which kinda surprised me"
278,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), Never played with Tenergy though
278,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), I wonder what would be the benefit/difference

279,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),I've played with Genius for a while
279,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), I would suggest sticking with Baraxuda because the durability really isn't that great and the rubber changes its playing characteristics over time
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),This is very difficult to say
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," About a year ago, one of my friends (third league Germany) in good supply of ""select pro"" Tensor rubbers (in other words almost the best that most companies can supply "

280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," Depending on how you play you might not even find a benefit, but you´d sure feel a difference"
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"In technical terms, tenergy is obviously still able to produce more spin than European rubbers - in the right hands"
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), On amateur level I think it´s a matter of preference and money
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," I love the way t05 feels, but it costs 60 Euro (no discount)"
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," The closest I know (Mantra M) I can get for 35, the closest Tensor I know (Aurus Prime) for even less"
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," And the ones I play, I mostly get for free, and they´re easily good enough for higher skills than mine, so that´s money saved and no considerable disadvantage for me"
280,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), But I have friends from third league and beyond who get to try every new Tensor generation and don´t ever think about switching
281,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"The bad thing is none of my friends play with it either, so I can't even try it out"
281,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), Not even the pro players I know use them
281,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda)," For me, trying Tenergy is just out of pure curiosity, since there's absolutely nothing wrong with Rhyzers I have"
281,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), They're almost perfect
282,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),How bout MXS instead? Genius chips on the edges easily
282,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda), Omega V Tour is also good

283,5f6874cdf57afe037caed112,Nittaku FastArc G1 vs DHS Hurricane 3 Neo Commercial," Also, both H3 Neo and G1 are relatively slower than MX-P and/or GA8 so you may simply be landing more balls on the table"

284,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, This can be resolved by slightly brushing the ball but it is easier to just use a german or jap rubber
284,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, If you like hurricane 3 then get an alternative hard rubber in the backhand that is spinny but also gives you bounce

287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,First off thanks for the replication!yogi_bearI already tried a 50° Tensor on my backhand
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," While the passive play was smooth, i had hesitation to play active in order to avoid the ball go out of the table"
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, My main question was about getting used to it and go for a little softer Tensor Version or stick with the comfortable/safety option H3
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, I haven't issue with BH rallies nor blocking but the amout of speed (low-moderate) and spin (nearly no at all) while playing
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," I guess adding spin just require to work von it (like i said i was too hesitant for looping and always took the safety shot with my BH, thats why looping technique isnt good tho)"
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,The main question in this regard is: can i develop a BH weapon with sticky hard (H3) or mid-hart (H3-50) chinese rubber or do i have to switch to a tensor
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,talbonthank you for the link
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," I agree with the linearity, thats why i love the chinese rubber, but i feel there's a power lose due to the stickiness"
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," I get the feeling that i wont ever get the physical effort needed to play the H3 at it's optimum, i think even the chinese pro's boost it just to match it with the hardness of the other's pro's equipment"
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, i cant believe them playing the hard version like i do
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," tbh i dont see that much of physical power improvement, thats why i consider a more softer chinese or european version (like H3-50, maybe H8?)Baalu'r right, equipment wont increase my development speed, but on the other hand i do have a imagination of my playstyle and if this doesnt match with the equipment, i will lose time to develop in the right direction"
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,right now i did find my basic on forehand with H3 and wants to convert into smth which is a bit easier to execut with an increase of the output given the current input
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," on the backhand side i did try both philosophies and kinda need smth inbetween, already mentioned it at my replay to yogi_bear"

288,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,Well I find it very hard to understand what it is you're saying or asking and I'd suggest being more concise
288,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"Regarding backhand tacky rubbers, not a good idea generally unless you know you can ALWAYS commit to an active attacking stroke with the backhand and being able to precisely judge the spin on the ball at all times"
288,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"Tacky of course isn't the problem, but rather that these tacky rubbers are almost always hard and very linear rubbers so without effort you get no speed"

290,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, for me an average player i like punch shots and passive blocking if i have to instead of always looping or driving everything
290,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, Tacky rubber demander better technnique to execute a good shot (you CAN hit shots that you wont be able to with a tensor but for me not worth it)

292,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, Tacky rubber work best if you want to reloop every ball close to the table
292,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, Tenergy 05 has a dimension that is similar to this which is why some players use it for this style as well

295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,since last training session i switched to the tensor (R50) on both sides
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," I must say my play feels alot smoother and i really enjoy the less demanding play, in fact i got alot safer with the beginning stroke TS on US"
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," while this was kind of random with the H3 without the feel why it was going wrong, now it's way more safer"

295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, my backhand is going to improve aswell
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," its less forgiving if ur stroke isnt properly or false unlike the H3, where u got real big control due to the sticky sheet"
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, but if u hit right the quality of the balls are satisfying
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,the biggest reason for the switch was the dust which overrides the stickyness real quick
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, i cant even do a full match with atleast 3 sets

295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, i dont think i can get to the full potential of the R50 right now
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," with a lot of preperation i could loopkill balls with my fh, the occasion's in a match game will be rare for this"
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, so on fh side i wanna improve the consistency of the opening and following loop

295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,just a mention on the s&r side: i did some test games
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, my serves weren't that good as before
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," while i'd get ALOT of direct points just by my serves in league games with the H3, now they are just undangerous"
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, on the recieve side i kinda feel more comfortable now
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," while the tackyness helped me to get the recieve real short, more often the ball was too short"
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment," my short game isnt dangerous anymore, but i kinda got some more control feeling back"
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,so far
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, thanks for all the input
295,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment, really appreciate that

296,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,I would use the EL-P as its softer
296,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S, This rubber works well on the backhand
297,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,I have used both rubbers on BH and i prefer EL-S
297,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,"much better than EL-P for looping, block, attacking both in short and awa from tableSent from my SM-A700H using Tapatalk"
298,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,"A bit off the topic, but I also tried EL-P on my previous TB ALC"
298,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S, I switched to Acuda S2 on bh side
298,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S," Also felt much better than EL-P, more control, easier to block, loop "
298,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S, Now I switched to a different blade anyway 
299,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,I agree here
299,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,EL-P has a much stiffer topsheet and an overall harder feel than EL-S
299,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S," But it depends on your game, go for EL-P if you rely on blocking and countering (direct shots) more than on spinny shots"
300,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,EL-S is mu choice since the el-p easily loses its bounciness and the el-s is spinnier with a lil bit more bounce
300,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S, The el-p feels dead sometimes

302,5f6876ef64fe8d59b1ff548c,Tenergy 05 max vs 05 1.9," Slight, not a world of difference"
303,5f6876ef64fe8d59b1ff548c,Tenergy 05 max vs 05 1.9,Which one of the tenergies has a higher throw angle: 05 or 05 fx? When I watch the YouTube commercial they say that the harder version? But I've heard different options
304,5f6876ef64fe8d59b1ff548c,Tenergy 05 max vs 05 1.9,"thicker it is harder to hit though so from what iv learnt thicker forehand thinner backhand is one of many working waysand on a harder wood like koto etc makes it easier to hit though but loose feel , so basically complicated yeah 05 normal would be higher coz harder indeed"
305,5f6876ef64fe8d59b1ff548c,Tenergy 05 max vs 05 1.9,I've used both at the same time and can definitely confirm T05 throws higher than T05FX

306,5f6876fa64fe8d59b1ff5492,Xiom Vega Pro vs Tibhar Evolution MX-P, Great rubber if youre below pro level
307,5f6876fa64fe8d59b1ff5492,Xiom Vega Pro vs Tibhar Evolution MX-P,Totally agree
307,5f6876fa64fe8d59b1ff5492,Xiom Vega Pro vs Tibhar Evolution MX-P, I'll add that it has more control than MX-P
308,5f6876fa64fe8d59b1ff5492,Xiom Vega Pro vs Tibhar Evolution MX-P,Folks the op already seems to be using Vega Pro

314,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, And after the asking
314,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,Enviado desde mi Moto G (4) mediante Tapatalk
315,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,You should get both and decide with which one you feel better
315,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,Once they asked Topsy bear what he would prefer - butter or cheese
315,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, He thought for a while and not knowing what to choose answered - Both
316,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,"I play with spin and my four most effective shots are backhand push, forehand topspin, backhand counter loop and forehand flick"
316,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, I would like to get as much spin on my pendulum and backhand serves as well
316,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, I like the throw angle low on my forehand
317,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,So better choise is to try tensors
317,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,"I don't know why you want a lower throw on the FH, but if it is so, you will need a softer rubber on the FH"
317,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," Usually its the opposite, but depends on style and stronger wing"
317,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," If it's your case, I would suggest Xiom Omega V Asia on the BH and Xiom Omega V Tour on the FH"
317,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, For me it's the opposite
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,Try both
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,But try the best of each
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,And don't try a hard chinese tacky rubber on your backhand
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," That's unhelpfulCorrect me if I'm wrong, anyone:Hard tacky rubber are better at very specific aspects:1) Generating a ton of spin on low energy balls (like serves and serve returns)2) Accuracy in low power shots (tackiness+hard sponge)3) More powerful than anything if you topspin with a lot of power (hard sponge=speed, tack=able to grab the ball in angles that would be difficult for non-tacky rubbers)4) Easy to alter the pace of the game (hard sponge, tack, no tensor, meaning that you can return a ball very fast or surprisingly slow if you want)While tensors are better at being consistently fast, which is great with:1) Low power reaction shots, but only against medium speed balls (IE the late-reaction-block, cuz it'll be returned with speed)2) Medium power shots (which are the great majority of shots for beginner/club level players)3) Require less effort to play quality shotsSecondary differences are that:1) Chinese rubbers are much, much cheaper generally2) Chinese hard/tacky rubbers are, in my experience, longer lived"
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," The hard rubber 'breaks in' and remains good forever basically, and the tackiness takes a loooooong time to go away completely (actually never happened to me yet), and the thing about tackiness is that even a little bit of tackiness is enough to grip the ball at the same level as a brand new non tacky rubber"
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," Granted, I always keep my chinese rubbers under a plastic sheet, while I don't do that with my tensors"
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,3) Chinese hard/tacky rubbers are extremely vulnerable to moisture and dirt
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," If you play in a badly air-conditioned, dirty place, you can kiss the rubber goodbye after like 15 minutes of play, until you clean it well and let it dry well"
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," If the air where you play is very humid, there is no hope for you"
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,My suggestion:Try the 729 Battle II as a tacky rubber
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, Ask for hardness 45
318,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," It's a ""modern"" chinese rubber"
319,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,Unless you have PERFECT technique and footwork you would have a lot much easier time with the s2
319,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, They are very different s2 is a soft euro rubber and thee h3 is much harder
319,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese," H3 is also good for players who want to improve their technique and footwork, as it is not very forgiving, but you will suffer a bit in match play"
320,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,Way different for both rubbers
320,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese, If you have the right stroke and
320,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,contact chinese rubbers like hurricane 3 are really good
321,5f68773264fe8d59b1ff54b1,Andro Rasanter R47 and R50 vs Butterfly Tenergy 05,Tenergy 05 is still spinny and faster than R50
321,5f68773264fe8d59b1ff54b1,Andro Rasanter R47 and R50 vs Butterfly Tenergy 05, R50 is slower than R47
321,5f68773264fe8d59b1ff54b1,Andro Rasanter R47 and R50 vs Butterfly Tenergy 05," Speedwise, R47 is bouncier than T05 but with lesser spin"
322,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,What is your strongest / most played shot on your backhand?How far from the table do you play?Can you read your opponents spin well?What throw do you prefer on backhand?Do you brush the ball on backhand or hit through the sponge to create spin?
323,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,"EL-S requires a decent impact to get any spin out of it, so it probably will not be that different from Mantra M"
323,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?," At the same time, 45 degrees is not too hard for BH, so probably the best thing is to review your BH technique"
324,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,These are great questions
324,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, We should make sure people answer these questions for equipment advice
325,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,"Since you are already familiar with rakza 7 soft(which is a great rubber in my opinion), I'd say use it and focus on your technique"
325,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, I wouldn't risk experimenting with a new rubber
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,concerning El-s it depends what you expect from the rubber
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?," personally it has a great ""feeling"" on composite blades"
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, I can feel the ball sinking into the rubber quite well while not getting mushy
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, however el-s is a matter of taste
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,Compared to the Mantra M id say the catapult isnt as prominent and the rubber is not as fast
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, i cant tell if there are differences in dwell because i only hit a few times with the mantra M
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,I personally think that El-s is a great backhand rubber but it has its flaws
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, active blocking is great
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, you can punch the balls with a lower arc and if pressured you dont have to close your bat angle as much
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, that effect is very obvious when switching from el-s to vega pro and the other way around
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, passive blocking however is delicate
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, i think when the sponge isnt engaged the ball flys into the net (which is a key difference when playing with tenergy05 to which this rubber was compared alot)
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, Thats why id recommend to spinblock most balls for more safety
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, short game pushing needs a little attention
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,So all in all you need a solid technique to get the El-s going but then it is a powerful backhand rubber
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, I would suggest this rubber to players who like to have a harder rubber on backhand (around 47
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,5 degree) while retaining good control
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,So in your case Id say either test the el-s first or go with the rakza soft which ive never played
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, Also you couldgo for fx-s instead of el-s for more control and less power
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?, But thats only what ive read without having played that rubber
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,My impressions are are about a 2
326,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,1mm El-S
327,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,i say the speed is almost the same but with a higher arc on the mx-s
327,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M," overall, i like the mxs better because it is a well balanced rubber in terms of control and speed and it has this vicious spin potential that is greater than the genesis m"
327,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M," also, it is not as sensitive to incoming spin"
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,I havent played MX-S
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M, The Genesis is probably lighter
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M, 2
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,0: around 42g-47g cut (157x150)2
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,2: around 45g-50gIm pretty sure that MX-S on average is heavier
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,Topsheet: really grippy which doesnt wear off for a long timedurability: the rubber has a longer lifespan than an average rubber so probably more than MX-S
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,You easily get more than 100 hours out of it
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M, With that being said topsheet and rubber are delicate
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M, Edges get messed up easily
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,Arc is medium-medium high and a long trajectory
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M, I find the 2
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,2 plays more euro style and u dont have to apply as much force as 2
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,0
328,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,But those are just my observations
329,5f68776d64fe8d59b1ff54d3,Joola rhyzm vs rhyzm tech,i would go with the rhyzm regular
329,5f68776d64fe8d59b1ff54d3,Joola rhyzm vs rhyzm tech," the tech version seems slower for me but if you hit really hard and can control it, the rhyzm regular is really good"
330,5f68776d64fe8d59b1ff54d3,Joola rhyzm vs rhyzm tech,I'd go for the standard rhyzm

332,5f68776d64fe8d59b1ff54d3,Joola rhyzm vs rhyzm tech,I should think so

335,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, Better on BH than MX-P
335,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,Reviewer recommend this to aggressive attack players who likes to hit the ball hard

335,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, The S version is slower and softer]
336,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"I was going to put a review on, as above it is white sponge and very soft I'd say"
336,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, Briefly it was on my bh and ws excellent control and punch blocks were really easy
336,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, I had it on Innerforce Layer Al and it was really mushy (like pillow soft) If you like the safety of soft sponge it is good but I thought it lacked power personally compared to Elp or els with not as much spin
336,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," Xiom rubber good if you fancy a change try the Vega Pro, quite similar to elp, little harder but still good control and more spin, speed"
336,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, Or even try els because that it a nice rubber I had on fh and bh and was quite surprised at how nice it was
336,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," Hope this help, is my view only though"
337,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"that is quite different opinion of what tibhar says: 45 degrees is quite hard, it shoult be harder then EL-P"
337,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," On polish website I have found that quantum is very spinny, while you say it is more fast the spinny"
337,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"i think I better stay with EL-P, which is good variation for FH rubber enough spin, enough fast and enough hard"
338,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"I would deffo try els, just a spinnier verion but though it had enough speed and control but with an extra bit of grip on topsheet"
338,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, Quantum was deffo softer though if I remember right
339,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"Just to make one thing clear, although the Quantums were released after the first Evolution rubbers they are by no means an update"
339,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,There is the Evolution line with new additions EL-S and FX-S and there is among others a Quantum line developed in parallel
339,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, A Quantum rubber compared to an Evolution rubber will most probably feel like a step back as the Quantums are meant to be more safe and easy to play
340,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,thanks this is what I wanted to hear
340,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," I forgot there is a new range of evo rubbers, that is why I though about quantum"
340,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, Since I am quite satisfied with EL-P I will try EL-S
340,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, It shouldn't be much different
341,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"The EL-S sponge is a little harder in average, the topsheet is softer and even more grippy"
341,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," The stiff topsheet of EL-P makes it ideal for direct play, EL-S is the rubber for a pretty easy first ball on underspin and everything that follows topspin-wise"
341,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," So if your next ball is a topspin, go for EL-S, if you open up to enter a game of block and counter stay with EL-P"
341,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, Which of course is not to say you can´t do everything with both
342,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,I understand your point
342,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P," EL-P is little bit better for flat hits , active block and counter - that is why I love it"
342,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P, But since I am trying to open the game with first topspin attack EL-S should be more suitable
342,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,I will check it out
342,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,Thanks again

408,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"As for Hurricane 3 Neo, i do not know because i haven't tried it beforeAnyway, what i want to tell you is that if you want to use Hurricane 8 or 3 Neo, you have to use a bit more strength compared to when using european rubbers and that you need to make small changes in your technique because from what i heard from the others who used chinese rubbers before, they had shoulder pain and etc when using it But well in my case, im fine with the rubber i haven't had any injuries yet so dont be too scared to try *** Also, not to forget that Hurricane 8 or 3 Neo is a hard rubber unlike other european rubbers so if you dont like hard rubbers i wont recommend it to you***For BH, you need to be more specific in what type of rubber do you wantHard or soft? (most prefer soft european rubbers) but well you dont have to go for what others prefer but im just recommending a soft one because with BH soft rubbers are catapult like and helps you make the BH a lot easier If you want recommendation for BH rubbers, please provide more info on what type do you want? fast or normal speed? Spinny or just speed? Because from what you said, every rubber is good at flicking and etc it just requires skills so yeh please be more specific Cheers!"
409,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I played both rubbers and I must say that hurricane 8 is better than 3 neo on hard varnished blades
409,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," Neo works good on flexible blades, also this rubber maintain much longer tackiness than hurricane 8"
410,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"I had them both on ZJK ALC and wood blades, H3 (the commercial version) on ZJK ALC was a disaster specially in the short game, very sensitive to incoming spin"
410,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, It was a bit better on wood blade but I didn't play with it for longer times
410,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, H8 on the other hand was better on both blades
410,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," However, and I'm not sure if this a good thing or not, both requires a perfect stroke and more effort (a large hand swing)"
410,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," the downside is that I lost many matches because of that but the positive side of the story is that it made things easier when I revert back to european rubbers, I might even say it accelerated my development in FH topspin"

412,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Stiga Genesis S for your backhand- i have posted review on here to read
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"I'm no expert by any means , I play close mid-range myself which I assume you do the same, I think we have the same style since I like to open by a chiquita (flip) on my backhand too"
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," With time I adapted to both Hurricanes but one problem always been there , lifting backspin , always extremly difficult and when I play against a defender it is just the mission impossible"
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," If you are somehow satisfied by H2 and you want an upgrade, H8 is more consistent in my opinion"
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," for the backhand I used to play with T80 FX and T64, it was quite fun, however blocking heavy spin is kinda difficult with the spring sponge"
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," I recently came accross these Tibhar Aurus variations (sound and soft) and I like it alot, light weight rubbers with very decent power and feeling"
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, rememeber Tenergies and hurricanes are somewhat heavy
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Hi Sakumi,what is your setup at the moment?Wooden or composite blade?For me, the H3 Neo (39 deg prov"
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,) suits my playing style in combine with the ALC blade
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Since the rubber quite heavy, it's better to choose rather heavier blade >90g"
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,It depends also on your technique; european technique should use softer sponge eg
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Hurricane 8 or Hurricane 3-50
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,For BH rubber I would suggest DHS Skyline 3-60
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Well if you want an upgrade to your H2, H8 or 3Neo would both be a good choice"
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"But well i would say H3 or H3Neo would be a better upgrade if you're used to H2 When compared H3 neo and H8, the H8 is slightly softer and has less tackiness so that's mean less spinny than H3 neo and also that means it gives you a bit more of control when playing even if you just start to use it H3 neo would be close to H2 just that its a lot faster and low ball trajectory"
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," So, i would say H3 neo would be a better choice but well you can have a try with H8 you might like it better who knows? As for your BH, From what you described above i think Tibhar Evolution MX-S or MX-P would be great and it is similar to Tenergy 05 but doesnt mean its the same as T05"
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,the feelings and touch is of course different from t05 as this is a medium hard rubber and its jus that the spin and speed of this rubber matches and is similar to the t05
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Most people choose it because it is similar to T05 and is half the price of T05 with much more durability
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Im currently using Omega V Pro and it is also similar to T05 in my point of view but it is slightly slower and less spinny but it has an incredible good control with high arc that helps to reduce errors or reduce hitting the ball into the net
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Well it worth the try and im actually liking it
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," **Also about the H8 and bigger stroke, there is no need to do a bigger stroke with H8 or full body stroke thats just what the chinese pro players does but i wouldnt recommend you to do so the chinese pro players do it because they were trained and used to that playing style but if you do it it will be a disaster because you dont have the reflexes like them, you cant recover for the next shot because you're not used to it and it requires incredible footwork to do so"
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," SO IF YOU WANT TO DO THE FULL BODY STROKES LIKE THE PRO CHINESE PLAYERS, YOU NEED TO WORK REALLY HARD ON YOUR FOOTWORK AND ATHLETICISM***"
416,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"LIKE I TOLD YOU IN MY FIRST POST, you need to provide me with more info on the type of rubber you preferLooking at pro players equipments is good but you should look for whats good for you rather than looking whats the pro uses and try to use it For example: Tenergy, I used tenergy for about 3 months but its not for me The rubber is too soft for me and it is really hard to adapt to these kind of rubber after using harder rubbers You see tenergy is not for everyone"
416,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, and you requires a lot of skills in order to use it
416,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Sorry to say this but i can already imagine you struggling using Tenergy after using a hard rubber on BH because it was the same for me
416,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," So, for now, for your BH, if you want a really fast rubber with medium amount of spin go for Stiga rubbers Stiga rubbers are really fast but kinda lacks in control but you'll get use to it in a short amount of time If you want a control with medium fast and medium spin, i would say try out Xiom Omega V Pro that im using It would worth your try and check out TTD channel on YouTube and check out their rubber reviews videos or search for reviews on specific rubbers in the equipment reviews i bet that will help you a lot Cheers! Good Luck!"
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,IMO the difference between the two is the technique or approach
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, If you like to loop the ball hard or spin the table that is H3 on the other hand H8 requires a more relaxed approach and really fine brushing if you loop the ball hard this is where I notice the slippage
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, The H8's sponge is more active than the H3 so expect it to be bouncier and one thing I noticed is that the H8 is comparable to a H3 provincial especially the higher quality of topsheet and the active sponge
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Lifting backspin is easy in H3 chinese style stroke and even easier in H8 if you can maximize the tacky topsheet and the active sponge
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Next week I'm gonna go back to H3 because the H8's slippage on hard shots is really annoying
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, 
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Roger, currently I'm using the stiga infinity vps v which is a wooden blade"
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,I think
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," On my FH I'm using the H2, which is what I'm mainly looking to upgrade, and the friendship/729 Higher 3 on my backhand which is quite good"
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, I was just wondering what other people were using which could influence my decision for a BH rubber in the future
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Thanks for the detailed reply iamvtwo
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, I did use tenergy 05 on my friend's bat for about 30 mins and tbh I found it really hard to control the trajectory of the ball due to it being very soft
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, The Tibhar Evolution MX-P and Xiom Omega V Europe looks very interesting
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, I will consider them both in the future when I want to replace my old one
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"From reading all the comments about H3 neo and H8, I'm starting to lean towards the H3 just due to the precise stroke and technique you have to use (Sometimes my stroke can be off) as well as it sounds like the H3 is more direct in the positioning of shots"
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, I have been looking at chinese players equipment because I feel a closer resemblance to their playstyle and I have realised that all have chosen the H3 over the H8 (disregarding different edition like national)
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Why is this?
419,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"The Joola Maxxx 400 also caught my eye for a potential BH rubber, what are your opinions?"
420,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Sakumi, I would stay using tacky chinese rubbers, since you're already familiar with them"
420,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," The modern ESN rubbers (Tibhar Evolution, Xiom ) are quite different to play"
420,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,The chinese rubbers are also not expensive
420,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Why don't you try H3 Neo first for the FH? I would suggest you to get the 39 deg sponge first to feel the difference (Try first the commercial one here: http://ttnpp

420,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8," Too soft and mushy for meEspecially with the 40+ balls, tacky chinese rubbers can produce more spin (with the right technique)"
421,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Do you know any websites that allow you to select the degrees other than that website? It will take 3 weeks for it be delivered

421,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,How much of a difference does untacky rubbers make ball compared to tacky rubbers?
422,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"The difference is very high, counter topspins even against tenergy rubber"
422,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Besides you'll have a very good control short game ( serve, return of serve, ball placement "
422,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"), But keep in mind that these rubbers are NOT suitable for smashing, only for thin brushing top spin with the forward movement and wrist snapping"
422,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8, Unfortunately this is the only website for the commercial H3 Neo with sponge degree selection that I know

426,5f6877f964fe8d59b1ff5525,Stiga Mantra vs Genesis,Hi Gezim the rubbers have not been released so I don't think no one has any idea just yet
426,5f6877f964fe8d59b1ff5525,Stiga Mantra vs Genesis, My thinking is that the Genesis will have more of a Chinese playing characteristics whereas the Mantra will have a Euro style

429,5f6877f964fe8d59b1ff5525,Stiga Mantra vs Genesis,How do you find your Rosewood VII with the Airocs Gezim and what are you hoping for from your new rubbers?
430,5f6877f964fe8d59b1ff5525,Stiga Mantra vs Genesis,Rosewood and airocs are perfect match
430,5f6877f964fe8d59b1ff5525,Stiga Mantra vs Genesis, Not only for me but for my friends too
430,5f6877f964fe8d59b1ff5525,Stiga Mantra vs Genesis, several from us have rosewood V or VII and airocs and Airoc astro

435,5f6877fa64fe8d59b1ff5526,Mx-p VS Xiom Sigma 2 Europe Europe, Sigma 2 euro first of has a softer sponge and overall softer feel
435,5f6877fa64fe8d59b1ff5526,Mx-p VS Xiom Sigma 2 Europe Europe," I don't think the throw angles are very different, but mx-p might be slightly higher"
435,5f6877fa64fe8d59b1ff5526,Mx-p VS Xiom Sigma 2 Europe Europe, MX-P is a bit heavier
435,5f6877fa64fe8d59b1ff5526,Mx-p VS Xiom Sigma 2 Europe Europe, I also believe MX-P is a tiny bit faster and spinnier
435,5f6877fa64fe8d59b1ff5526,Mx-p VS Xiom Sigma 2 Europe Europe,Meanwhile Sigma 2 euro slightly easier to control
436,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,Rising Dragon is a chinese rubber
436,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," It's probably classed as a hybrid because it's semi-tacky (topsheet looks very much like yinhe big dipper) rather than full-on tacky like a classic H3, and its sponge is modern and porous (I could believe it if someone said it was a japanese sponge - it's really nice) rather than rock-hard and solid"
436,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,"If you wanted to experiment with a move from ESN to chinese than Rising Dragon is a good one to try out for sure, but it's pretty expensive for what it is"
436,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,A cheaper option - I've recently got hold of a sheet of Sanwei Target National (blue sponge)
436,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers, It's cheaper than Rising Dragon but is along the same lines - semi-tacky and porous sponge - and I wonder if they come from the same factory
436,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," I haven't had chance to try it out yet but the sponge looks really similar, while the topsheet feels similarly tacky but is a fair bit softer"
437,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,What is the price?
438,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,Rising Dragon is 46 from TT11
438,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,Target National is £20 from eaching's ebay store (free shipping)
439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,I have played with Rising Dragon once
439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," The rubber is not very tacky, meaning that it much more felt as tensors rubber like Mark-V"
439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," Yes, it says hybrid on description but it is simply a combination of tensors with slight tackiness"
439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," Therefore, you have less spinny serves than those super-tacky Chinese rubbers"
439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," However, the good thing about Rising Dragon is that it is much controllable than chinese rubbers"
439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,"In my opinion, I do not think Rising Dragon can replace boosted chinese rubbers"
440,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,"Well, i was just about to replace my old Nittaku-DHS H3 with a Rising Dragon"
440,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers," The sheet has already arrived, but i just also received a h3 rubber unexpectedly a couple of days ago, so the RD's still gotta wait a bit"
440,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,I'll keep you posted what i think of the replacement in a couple of weeks

444,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, but thats just me
445,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,ive bought over 600USD worth of stuff from ttnpp
445,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, but i wouldnt be too sure about their national rubber
445,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, i bought blue sponged tg3 from them and it was great
445,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, mind though long deliveries
446,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,ok so i should go for PROTT
447,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,You should just pay more attention while reading cause i bet you will not find a single NEO word in the ttnpp national and i know you can't cause it is the old speed glue version
447,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, That s why it s 55 USD
447,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, i bought about 6-7 nationals from ttnpp in last years and every single one was very good
447,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, If you boost the old version and the Neo version the old version will be slightly faster but slightly harder to control too
448,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,Thanks
448,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, I will boost it but i prefer more control
449,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,"Yeah i do too and i love chineese tacky rubbers but not so much to pay extra 45 USD and for that small of a difference, maybe blue sponge version is better don't know never played it"

454,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,for you what is the biggest difference between H3 commercial and national?

455,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, so i found that rubber difficult to use

467,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, the times after that i had purchased the same glue but from other vendors it was no longer latex style
467,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, still good just not what i was expecting
468,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott,I have only bought fairly standardized products from ttnpp and there is nothing that indicates a fake

471,5f68783d64fe8d59b1ff554f,Ttnpp vs prott, Has anybody bought anything from them in the last 2 weeks?

473,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines, The 999 series of rubbers are excellent and used to be far more popular than Hurricane
473,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines, But DHS marketing changed gear about 2000AD and rubbers like 999 and 729 took a back seat
473,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,If you are youngish and are at a good amateur level then forget about Chinese rubbers
473,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines, The difference in technique is too great and you'll eventually return to T05 after a long and expensive experimental journey
473,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines, I've seen it happen many times

475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,"Denizyilmaz, i haven't seen you play yet, but if you use the same technique on tacky rubbers like you've been using for your tenergy, then it's no big surprise you didn't get more spin from the big dipper"
475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines, I think that is kind of what tinykin meant
475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines, You have to change/adjust your technique to make these tacky rubbers shine
475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,To make tacky rubbers excel it recquires a full arm swing stroke with a very brushing contact of the ball
475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,"Most people that use temergies and tensors don't do this kind of swing, but instead it's more of a underarm/half arm swing than full arm and engaging more the sponge, whereas with a full arm swing you rather engage the topsheet"
475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,You can try to get the tackiest rubber like friendship 729 origin or friendship 729 origin soft and most likely still won't get better results (MORE SPIN!! I guess that is what you're after) If you don't adjust your technique
475,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,There have been so many threads and vids on this forum about this topic already

Slower more spinny? Most similar but just diferent? Anything you're having a hard time doing with Tenergy 05? or any other thoughts?

487,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?, the topsheet is grippy and it grabs the ball through friction while the sponge produces most of the spin
487,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?, this means the ball has to sink deep into the rubber if you want to produce a powerful loop
487,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?,chinese rubbers have a sticky (tacky) topsheet so they grip the ball even without it sinking deep into the rubber
487,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?," however, they also have a harder sponge compared to euro/jap rubbers"
487,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?, a harder sponge rubber has more potential to produce power but you have to commit to the shot and put a lot of power into it or the result will be poor
487,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?,it can get tricky when looking at brands because some chinese brands have euro type rubbers (LKT Pro XP) and some euro brands have chinese type rubbers (Donic Akkadi Taichi)

501,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?, But if you change the rubbers to Sriver or Mark V then you will still have an adjustment for the rubbers and rubbers like Sriver or Mark V on a TB ALC is a bit weird

506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Baracuda is the most spinny rubber lve used
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, It is very easy to control during topspin to topspin rallies
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, Very good for controlled looping and you can also hit the ball hard when needed
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, But the rubber is not that fast and is a little bit soft
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, I would recommend this rubber on the backhand
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,I never used any rubbers of the coppa series so I cant review them
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Rakza 7 has also good spin not as much as baracuda but I think it comes close to Tenergy 05
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, It has good touch in my opinion
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, Some people say its too bouncy but they probably have a bad touch
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, Its a very good rubber for flicking short balls
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, The only problem I found with this rubber is that when you try to hit the ball flatter and harder on the topspins you have less controll about where the ball goes
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, It work good on smashing high lobs but when they lob the ball lower you have to make a bit of a brushing action when smashing
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7, so Ill rate the rubbers 1-10 on each point
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Baracuda;Spin; 9
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,5Speed; 7 (8 on harder and faster blades)Hardness; 4
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,5Controll; 8
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,5Rakza 7;Spin; 9Speed; 9Hardness; 6
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,5Controll; 8So I would recommend Baracuda if your more of a slow looper that relies on spin and controll above speed
506,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,I recommend Rakza 7 when if you like to loop with power

508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers,"Chinese rubbersFor me, I love using chinese rubbers on my forehand side, especially Hurricane 3 Neo"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, Chinese rubbers are hard and tacky (not when you move to Provincial or even National series)
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, They produce whole lots of spin when you play your stroke
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," Some say they are slow and dead, the main thing is you should develop your stroke as the speed is all about your stroke"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, Chinese rubbers are best paired with flexible blade
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," I've read most of the article by those chinese, they like to pair Hurricanes with Stiga's blade such as OC and Yinhe MC2"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," If you're a flat hitter, look for others but if you're mainly winning points by looping (either open ups or power looping) and close to the table, Chinese rubbers suit you best"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers,Euro rubbers
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers,"For these, I'll break into two: Euro and Japanese (they act differently though)I used Euro rubbers on my backhand, because they are tensored"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," As your backhand movement should be more compact than your forehand stroke, a tensor Euro can help you to compensate it"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," When I first used Euro rubbers on forehand, they act really weird because I'm used to Chinese rubbers"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, Generating spin require accurate timing as you need the ball to sink into the sponge
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," In the short game, they are really bouncy but they shines when you go for med-long distance looping"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, They are more forgiving for some of the people
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, They had more catapult effect when compared to Chinese rubbers
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers,"Japanese rubbersWell, I'm planning to change my Vega Elite to Rakza 7 (backhand)"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers," From what I know, Japanese rubbers are just like hybrids for Euro and Chinese"
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, Generating spin is easier and it is not as fast as Euro rubbers (a few steps below them)
508,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers, They emphasize on control and spin
509,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,Hello butt stallion I havent played with T64 much but I think T05FX is one of the most allround rubbers out there
509,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, Definetely less bouncy than T05 and with more dwell time in soft touches and shots
509,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," T05 is for hard attacks, T05FX is better"
509,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, A good choice would also be donic acuda or yasaka rakza 7 soft if you dont like T05FX
510,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,I am playing with 05FX on my backhand and really like how it works for me
510,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," But, both are good rubbers"
510,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, I believe 64 has a lower throw than 05FX
510,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, The next time I change rubbers I will have 64 on my backhand because that is what I have lined up
510,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," But, 05FX is what I want"
511,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,i used t05 on bh
511,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,excellent bh rubber!
512,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,"Hey, thanks for the info"
512,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, @upsidedowncarl:have you ever tried your T05fx on a bouncy all wood blade like Rosewood? Because all the carbon blades take the bounciness of most of the rubbers away
513,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,Hello BS i would agree with carl
513,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, t64 has a low throw and better on bh skills (less effort) but not okay performing drop shots over the net in service receive

515,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,if you have 2 blades then why not have T64 on 1 and 05fx on the other?
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,Yep
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, I have tried it many times on a Rosewood
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, I have a friend who has a Rosewood XO with 05FX on both sides
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, To me it felt great
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, I have another friend who has a Rosewood V NCT and it feels pretty good on that as well
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, Everyone is different
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," For me, I can get the ball to sink into the topsheet and sponge and really spin the ball well with my backhand when I am using 05FX"
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, It feels really good for flipping and has amazing control for blocking
516,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," On my blade, when I am blocking someone whose loops are erratic (change of spin, speed and/or placement) I will turn to my 05FX for blocking because of how much control it has and how I can slow the ball down if I want to, when I block with it"
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,Hi BS
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, I saw your post on mytt as well
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, Here is my advice
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, I have played with T64 on my BH for almost 3 season now and have tried many other rubbers incl
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, T05FX
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, As many other people already mentioned T64 have lower throw than other Tenergy's and the T64 grips the ball more due to the larger pimple distance
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, This make the rubber great at BH flipping
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, The bounciness you can't avoid with the Tenergy series but it is something you can adjust to
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,"When playing the T64 it need a high load to ""activate"" the rubbers potential which make the rubber great when push blocking"
517,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, Due to the low throw you can keep the blocks low
518,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,Thanks for the advices
518,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," Im gonna try T64 first because I can get it a little bit cheaper and if it doesnt work well, Im gonna try the T05fx"
518,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64," My backhand game consists of a lot of blocking, quick driving and looping, I use more the full arm to accelerate and create spin than my wrist so I guess T64 could be the better choice for me"
518,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64, Im gonna let you know how itll worked out!
519,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,I think tenergy64 isn't good for amateur player backhand I use blue fire jp 03 on my backhand it is incredible!Sent from my RM-914_im_mea3_1023 using Tapatalk
520,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,I used to play with T64 on BH but now I'm testing 80fx and I like it very much! Maybe consider that as an option also
521,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,tenergy 05 fx always
522,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,T05fx of course
523,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,just flick it

525,5f6879d6887afbc97df838e3,H3Neo vs SkylineIII,"skyline : faster , longer trajectory"
525,5f6879d6887afbc97df838e3,H3Neo vs SkylineIII, bit less spin
525,5f6879d6887afbc97df838e3,H3Neo vs SkylineIII, generally easier to play with easier to master
525,5f6879d6887afbc97df838e3,H3Neo vs SkylineIII,"H3: more spin, shorter trajectory, higher arc"

529,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,The Mark V is too old
529,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Most people here will suggest it for beginners
529,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, I'd suggest taking a step forward and purchasing a tensor
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,I played with markV 2
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"0mm for more then 2 or 3 years,in speed glue era"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"It was one of the most controlled rubbers i played with at time,in any stance"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"For the game of nowadays,i would recommend Aurus normal version or if you can afford it,an andro rasant,just heard well of it,and both seem pretty similar in most ways"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,Both of them got great control and pretty good spin and speed
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"Good for loopers and allround players,with an agressive feeling"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"Tacky rubbers got something like glutinosity on topsheet,which normally is better to ""grab"" the ball better,being mostly used for loopers and choppers"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"As for the tackiest rubber, look at DHS Hurricane, Skyline and Haifu Blue Whale rubbers"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,The advantage that tacky rubbers have is that the rubber will grip the ball at more extreme angles than non tacky rubbers will
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,It is generally a little slower and can provide slow loops with heavy spin
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"Also,the ones i mentioned are pretty cheaper then Aurus,tensors can be a good choice,but still pricy"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"Tacky rubbers need a better technique and an more athletic physic-state when for fast-hard looping,since they are not that fast with only arm movement,they need the body to put strenght on it,while non-tacky are easier to generate speed,cuz the sponge is softer then chinese tacky ones,and normally the topsheets too"
530,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,Hope i've helped
531,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,That's great advice guys and thanks for your thoughts on the Yasaka Mark V
531,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, But could you also give me some insight on the DHS Memo 2
532,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,I doubt you'll find someone using that
533,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,Well if that's the case then could I also get some insight on more popular rubbers such as DHS Hurricane series or DHS Skyline series
534,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,Tacky rubbers with hard sponge
534,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Very slow on european type stroke and they demand a huge chinese style stroke (tons of spin)
534,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, To exploit their full potentional you need to boost the sponge 
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,I have Memo 2 FH and TNT BH on a DHS carbon cpen CW-D
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Not sure of their individual weight but the whole setup is a heavy 192g
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, I also have Mark V FH and R7 BH on a YEO which weight 180g
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Memo 2 has a medium hard sponge not far from Neo TG3
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Top sheet is non-tacky but grippy similar to Mark V
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Memo 2 gives a nice bounce and great spin
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Hard sponge and non-tacky top sheet may not be good for slow topspin that you prefer
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, I get more feedback from the soft Mark V on YEO than Memo 2 on a fast carbon blade
535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V, Worth a try for the low price
536,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Are they National version rubbers or commercial version that you can get for example from ttnpp for ~$20?

540,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, I have not not own this rubbers
540,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, But i tried them before
540,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," Let's compare h3 neo Nat orange sponge and h3 neo national blue sponge, blue sponge tend to be slower and more spin and speed whereas for the orange spobgeis versi-versa"
540,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, But if you are buying the $26USD special sponge 22# h3 or skyline neo commercial
540,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," Don't think about it, reviews have shown that it is even slower than commercial orange sponge ones and it would only be amazing if you use speed glue for the 22# sponge commercial version Hope you understand :x"
541,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"""slower and more spin and speed""I'm sorry, but "
541,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, what?
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Ok, firstly"
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, National versions of everything: prott
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"ccSecondly, I have used Skyline 3 (TG3) Blue Sponge extensively and have had experience using Hurricane 3 (H3) Blue Sponge"
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, The following experience is completely without boost
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, The TG3 is spinnier and better on the short to mid-table play as it has a softer sponge it has better feel and hence better touch
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," The H3 is noticeably faster and it is far better at away from the table looping ""a la"" the top Chinese guys"
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," Thirdly, the blue sponge versions are NOT slower than the orange sponge versions"
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, They are most definitely faster albeit not very noticeable because like most Chinese rubbers the ball only moves as fast as you hit
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Lastly, both TG3 and H3 will last around 2-3 months of 10 hours a week play before completely ""falling off the cliff"" in terms of performance"
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, Make sure you take good care of them and cover them when you're not playing
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," After they die, you can still use them for another month or so with speed glue"
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, This is actually better than the orange sponge version which lasts a little less long
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Pretty interesting
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, I'm considering right now to get the TG3 blue sponge commercial on TTNPP or a H3 neo BS provincial maybe a little cheaper than on prott
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, The problem is that the TG3 BS is 39° and softer (more like 37°/38°) than H3 neo orange sponge provincial also 39°
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, I am using the H3N right now in 39° with dianchi and I find it just a bit too soft when boosted
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, I think I might prefer the 40° hardness
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," TTFrenzy: I think you're right about the pretty weak differences between Com, Prov and Nat"
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, But I think you're mistaking about the CNT getting their H3N/TG3 already boosted
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," There is even a video where you can see Ma Lin and Wang LiQin using Haifu Oil ! But even if I didn't know this video, I'd still be convinced: I am sure that they either boost their sheets themselves or (most likely) have it done by a small staff at the CNT training center that prepare the rubbers with Dianchi, Haifu Oil or whatever it is (after all, what proof have we that they really use Dianchi ? excepting Prott trying to make a quick buck by saying the product is used by chinese top-players"
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"? One thing is for certain: they DO boost, but with what) for the whole crew or at least for the 5 top-players, or just the ones who prefer having it done by a staff member instead of doing it themselves"
544,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,do you know where I can buy DHS Skyline TG3 (No
544,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, 21 Blue Sponge) Onine?
545,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,ttnpp sells Blue sponged DHS
545,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," i bought mine(tg3BS) and was very happy with it it plays great untuned , close to the table, then i tuned it with falco long boost( very heavy tune"
545,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, it lasted nearly a year tuned)
545,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, once tuned it was more of an alway from the table rubber but still easy to use
546,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"HiI have also played with Skyline 3 blue sponge and it is my favorite rubber, but I got bubbles on the topsheet of 3 of my rubbers so I have to stop using them"
546,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," I boost my rubbers, and think it is a little strange that the durability of the topsheet is so bad, I assume that the blue sponge is created for speedgluing and yet the topsheet breaks down"
546,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," I have played with all the commercial Hurricanes and skylines and I think the blue sponge are softer, faster, more elastic and lighter"
546,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," Well I don´t know if its the topsheet or the gluing of the topsheet, but if I boost the H3 yellow sponge it never happens maybe the topsheet on blue sponge don´t stick togheter with the sponge when they glue it togheter with the topsheet"
547,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,strange mine was boosted loads but is still going strong apart from some rips there and there
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,TTFrenzy I thought I'd add my point of view here
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"When we talk about ""National"" version Blue Sponge it is the highest quality controlled rubber that DHS provides and it is given to the Chinese National Team"
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, The next highest quality rubbers are given to the Provincial teams and then the rest are sold commercially
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Basically speaking all rubbers are made in facilities located in Germany, Japan, Korea or China"
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, It doesn't matter what brand it is they are usually made in one of these manufacturing facilities
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," This means that the topsheets are typically comprised of the same rubbers, but the pips structures and sponges are made with different processes to provide the different feeling"
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,All rubber is created from a very large sheet
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," I'm talking (and I don't know what the actual measurements are, but you will understand the concept from this example) about as large as a TT Table so let's say 9x5 feet"
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, The center of these rubbers have the highest quality control because they are the least likely to ripple or become different than the further out you go (Think pie crust when you roll it the center is always perfect but the further out you go it is usually worse) Each rubber is cut and then stamped with the different names and then tuned if necessary
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge," The different degrees of hardness I believe depend on the entire sheet's degree of hardness, but typically the center is always the hardest and the further out you go the less hard it is"
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, That is why commercial rubbers are always a little different from each other
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,National versions are made to a player's specifications
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, Usually this means they are very hard and then the player will boost it to provide the proper softness feeling they prefer whether 42 degree like Wang Liqin and Ma Long or 40 degree like say Zhang Ji Ke or Xu Xin
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, Provincial players will usually ask for 38 degree or 39 degree which is why they are much more common
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, This also means they will be boosting a bit less because it is already softer than the more CNT preferred 40 + degrees
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, I think it is safe to say that Provincial players just don't hit as hard as the CNT players do which is why they are not in the CNT
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,So to answer your questions I would have to say that blue sponge typically has more catapult than the orange sponge
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, The Neo sponge is pretuned which makes it different than the Blue sponge but the topsheets are the same
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,And as for your other questions because you're using Commercial it is hard to tell because they are not perfect examples of what the rubbers are supposed to be like
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, here's a thread that I posted about what the rubbers are supposed to be like

554,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, It is true that it's very hard to get provincial and national rubbers
554,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, Because they're made exclusively for provincial and cnt players
554,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, Only the players will sell the rubber either back to DHS or to another dealer

557,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,You would be overpaying for the rubbers
557,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, They're commercial and usually $20-$25 USD depending on the vendor
557,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge, $34 is overpriced

560,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,kinda pointless adding your site there since you dont have any blue sponged rubbers like the ones mentioned above
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,i havent
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," i chop with hurricane 3 (normal, commercial), and find it very spinny"
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"so cant really help, sorry"
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"i found generally, when i attacked, the softer the rubber, the faster it is"
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, although obviously most soft rubber produce a lot of spin too
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"i find the chinese rubbers are generally very tacky and good for spinning though, and h3 is one of the best, so im not a lot of help"
561,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,sorrry :/perhaps its just a duff sheet
562,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,it comes down to technique with the rubber differences
562,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," because H3 has a very hard sponge, there is not alot of time that the ball is contacting it before it is off the rubber"
562,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," you need more brushing of the ball to get more spin, and not going through the ball as much as before"
562,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," cant say for sure without seeing, or for that matter feeling what you are doing"
562,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,but i think the issue definitely comes down to developing a better feel for touch and brushing the ball
562,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"but im no expert, im just thinking physics wise that's what makes sense :] hope that helped"
563,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I can copy that
563,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," The harder the sponge is, the more you need to work on your touch"
563,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," While it is easier to generate a certain amount of spin with softer rubbers you can get a lot more spin with the H3 due to its tacky rubber, but, as already mentioned, you have to improve your ""touch"""
563,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"It is the same thing, when deciding the thickness of the sponge"
563,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Maximum generates more speed and spin but needs a cleaner technique than thinner sponges
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Well, yes and no, depends on what blade you use"
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," If you are playing a hard sponge on a very flexy blade, the hard sponge will really engage the blade flex and as a result, your racket will have plenty dwell"
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," A soft rubber on the same racket, will typically not engage the blade flex as much, so you get more dwell from the rubber but much less dwell from the blade"
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," (Soft rubber will take much of the ball's impact energy, and use it to catapult the ball, so much the energy gets dissipated in the sponge"
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Hard dead sponges let most of the impact energy push the rubber into the blade, so if the blade is flexy, you get dwell and catapult from the blade instead of the rubber"
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,")I play a very flexy blade with hard rubber on the forehand and soft on the backhand, and this effect is very noticeable if I twiddle"
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, (I twiddle when I EJ my soft backhand rubber and I'm curious of how it plays on the forehand
564,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,)
565,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," i agree, just speaking in general terms, the harder the sponge, the more Brush/touch you need in your stroke to get the most out of it"
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Sponge hardness is a topic that is often misunderstood
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Various amounts of spin & speed are produced on the ball depending on several factors
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"These factors are1)Dwell time (mostly related to spin but in soft rubbers it creates speed also) 2)Power of the stroke (related to spin & spin also, the harder the hit the faster the ball, the harder the brush the spinnier the ball)3)Tehcnique timing & angle of the stroke that also produce different amounts speed & spinSome physics to understand betterThere are two forces on the ball a) the tangential one that creates spin b)and the lateral one that creates speedNotice that by the term speed we mean horizontal speed not vertical! The actual result of these two forces is that the ball is travelling spinny and speedy creating an arc"
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Lets assume that a table tennis sponge is like a spring 
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Hard springs when compared to softer ones when fully compressed produce more force thus more acceleration (F= K X A , Newton's law) thus more speed, to the object that compresses them"
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," K is the modulus of elasticity of the spring=sponge, F the Force , A fore accelerationConclusion no1 : When the sponge is hard you need strong hitters to manage to compress the sponge at its full in order to take full advantage of its abilities ! To achieve that you need a hard hitter with perfect timing and angle of the racket"
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Like any chinese professional player for example
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,doesnt have to be top10
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, That doesnt mean that if you are in good physical condition with fast footwork and good body & wrist rotation (but not a pro player) you cant play effectively with a chinese rubber
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Conclusion no2 : With softer sponges (the sponge has more ""porosity"") you need less power and have big margin for error in your angle of your strokes to achieve a desired arc (speed&spin)"
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Because of the softness, the ball compresses easily the sponge at its full potential giving you & me and the whooole TTdaily forum amateur players an easy task!Conclusion no3 : Knowing the importance of timing, paddle angle and sponge hardness, underspins lifted with hard rubbers need perfect technique and timing compared to the soft ones"
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," A heavy underspin if lifted with a small error in technique using a soft rubber, maybe will not be lifted (or lifted with less pace & arc) with a hard rubber"

566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,If you have good technique footwork and physique you can play with a hard tacky rubber like the hurricane (boosted of course
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,chinese rubbers were invented to be boosted) 
566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, If you are a beginner who still is improving his shots prefer a soft rubber

566,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Notice that conclusion1&2&3 are considering the exact same stroke with the exact same incoming ball to your paddle
567,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"T-11 is a fast blade, and won't hold the ball nearly as long as a typical pre-made racket"
567,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, (These are usually allround-style 5-ply rackets which have lots of dwell
567,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,) I think this is the main problem
568,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Read my previous post if you like  It is rather unlikely that the 729 FX produces more spin that the hurricane
568,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Maybe you feel that way because it is softer thus giving you more feedback in your palm
568,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Of course the fact that you have an OFF+ blade plays an important role in the dwell time of the blade
568,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,pre made paddles are very slow compared to custom ones
568,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, So they have more dwell time=more spin
569,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,what a great post
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I think it's also because your equipment jump is quite extreme too
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Here is some reasons and stuffs for your own study about this matter:1
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," In the forehand you are now using a chinese tacky rubber instead of your previous Search engine keyword: chinese rubber vs euro/jap rubber, tacky rubber vs grippy rubber, topsheet spin and mechanical spin2"
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Both in your forehand and backhand, you are now using harder spongeSearch engine keyword: table tennis soft vs hard rubber, table tennis dwell time3"
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Both in your forehand and backhand, you are now using rubber with higher throw angleSearch engine keyword: table tennis rubber throw, table tennis high throw low throw4"
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Both in your forehand and backhand, your rubber now has vertically aligned pips (horizontally before)Search engine keyword: table tennis vertical pips horizontal pipsSorry can't tell much, gotta run, I hope this helps Edit: and as always, TECHNIQUE is the other side of the coin"
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Can't leave that
571,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,H3 is very tacky?How do you judge that?because after a few hours of play I can only slightly feel the tackiness
571,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, and I did not find it especially tacky as new
572,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,How do I get more brushing if there is less contact time?
573,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Again why do everyone says H3 is very tacky?I did not find it that way
573,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, In fact I when comparing Super FX and H3 as new I would say I find Super FX tackier
574,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,What do you mean boosted?How do I do that?Actually I have been playing for around 5 years with pre-made rackets and thought that it was time to give custom made ones a try
574,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I mostly read some reviews online to choose my blade and rubbers and bought it off ebay as the prices literally robbery
574,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Ty
575,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I would have preferred to check the goods before buying but unfortunately that is not possible and I made my choice by going along with some reviews
575,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Isn't Super FX a chinese rubber?Actually when I choose degree of sponge I choose 40 because I wanted the feel to be a bit like Super FX(found it a bit hard but just right), but as degree are just numbers online I made a wrong decision"
575,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,thanks
576,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,??????????????3????2?????????????????40????????
577,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,anyway ditch the t11 the only thing its good for is attacking miles away from the table with hurricane
577,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"get something like a rosewood, or hurricane Hao, or a clipper wood"
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"unfortunately I cannot change blade due to financial reasons,I will just have to do with it"
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, What I want is to adapt to what I have
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Reviews tabletennisdb were only praising the t11 saying that it's good for attacking etc
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,that's why I went along with it
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,and I'm not very muscular that's why I choose something light as reviews said that rubbers themselves were already a bit heavy
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Anyway I play only during my free time from university and I don't want to spent more money on something that I do only 1-2 every 2 week, my budget is at its limit"
578,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,btw why is it good for is attacking miles away from the table?I played with it and can attack perfectly fine near the table
579,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I can't read chinese
580,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"edit: too many edits, made new post"
581,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"hey,I think that the hurricane a faster rubber is and the ball is quicker from your racket"
581,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,The ball doesn' t stay that long as your old rubber
581,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," You have to change your playing style a little to get morespin on the ball, i had the same problem"
581,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, After a mond you shout get more spin on the ball
581,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Sorry for English 
582,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Well 729 Super FX is designed to play like japanese/euro rubber
582,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"To make good spin out of it you need to engage the sponge, while getting good spin from your tacky rubber also involves the topsheet now, esp"
582,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, in service
582,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Might be the reason you are lacking spin on service albeit using a rubber with higher spin potential Using your premade racket blade is a very viable option I say 
583,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"not yet, I still play with it to compare it with the new racket"
583,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Also is it normal that H3 is not as tacky as before with around 2hrs of play?I mean I see a very big difference when it's new and after 2hrs
584,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,lol would this $5 blade be better than t11?
585,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Amazing post! I learnt a lot there!
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," The point is, what is the best blade for a given individual player? You say you play 1-2 hours? sessions? every 2 weeks"
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," I know a guy who used to have pretty good control with his Timo Boll Spirit, but now he can only practice 2-4 hours a week, so it was difficult for him to maintain the technique needed for his offensive blade"
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, So now he's using a slower blade
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Like Yosua says, your 5$ premade blade might be better for players like you and me"
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, The 729 premade blades are actually pretty decent quality blades in the 5-ply all-wood allround class
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,With time I'm sure you can get used to the T-11+ if you really want to
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, But you will need to be patient and you will need to accept that this kind of fast blade won't be very forgiving of your mistakes
586,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," And then it's up to you if you want fast speed & difficult placement control & more mistakes (T-11+), or less speed & easier placement control & less mistakes (slower blade)"
587,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I was playing everyday before so I reach a decent level but I'm devoting more time to studying now as university is very demanding
587,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," I can attack and spin fine, it's just that I miss the feeling of sensing the ball getting into that sponge btw I have an old Stiga Amaze blade, is this good?"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"by having a thinner contact, I dont remember who said it in a video once, i think it was about michael maze serving, but it applies here, ""Its like slicing the skin off an apple with a blade"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,""" not taking a chunk out of the apple  hope thats a good visualization ""boosting"" was something that used to be done to rubber just before a match using what was called ""speed glue"" it would enhance the properties of the rubber"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," making them better, So rubbers like shriver were fantastic when boosted, which is why it was so popular"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, and the also the Chinese rubbers were designed knowing that they would be boosted afterward
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," the 2008 olympics were the last time speed glue was legally used, it was banned from any tournament"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"so now rubbers like shriver are only good, instead of great"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, completely understandable
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, rubbers and everything are going through the roof in price
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, But i wouldnt worry about heavy rubber
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," I im 5' 7"" and weigh like 110"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," and im using what is considered a quite heavy rubber, once u adjust its fine, just depending on how hard you play, watch out for carpel tunnel in the wrist, or tennis elbow"
588,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," you can get both of these with light rubber as well, just be more aware of it"

592,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,make it more tacky? not sure
592,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," i had a butterfly pre-assembled that was very tacky, and when it lost alot of its tackiness, i brushed oil (olive, vegetable, whatever) on the rubber, and let it soak in, and repeat a couple times, that will restore alot of the tackiniess, but im not sure about making it MORE tacky"
592,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, as far as i know the oil is still illegal for tournament
592,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," but other people, or clubs nobody is really going to care"

593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,A thin contact (not less contact time
593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,) means that you brush the ball more and hit less

593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Its very good and cheap blade for beginners
593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Dont play the hurricane without booster it is not worth it! Other buy a booster (dian chi haifu seamoon booster stiga booster etc) or buy a cheap non tacky european/japanese technology rubber
593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I believe either you notice something wrong with your hurricane or your hurricane is bad product
593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It is definetely one of the most tackiest rubbers out there and for sure more tacky than the friendship you had on your premade paddle
593,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Hope I helped, if I was you I would sell my T11 (too fast for a beginner) and buy an allwood ALL+ OFF- blade"

596,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,nope it soaks in
596,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, you'll be surprised :P
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"There were a lot of posts since mine, so I won't quote everything But first before you decide: I am no expert, so I'm only telling you from my experience To me the H3 was beside my Skyline the tackiest rubber I ever had, but those were the only chinese I actually had"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I used to play european rubbers until I discovered those 2 and I haven't tried out any other
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Maybe that's why our opinion differs about it's tackiness
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Also neither my H3 nor the Skyline have lost their tackiness (even after 1-2 month's)
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I just have to breath onto it and swipe the humidity from it and ist nearly as tacky as new (or use some water)
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I have never boosted the topsheet since I heard, that it wouldn't work"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," John_Pish said, that he had done it and it worked"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Maybe you'll try it out
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," But as I said, I've only heard about unsatisfying results"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,But boosting the rubber is something completely different
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," As already mentioned, they used to glue with speedglue"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," This is now forbidden so manufacturers have come up with ""boosters"""
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," They are not glue, so you still have to glue your rubbers with some VOC free glue"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," But since it's pretty hard (or even impossible?) to reveal that somone has boosted, most of the pro's do it"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,These boosters add some spice to your blade (but still illegal)
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," They make your rubbers faster, spinnier and they feel a lot softer"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, You can search for it in this forum or in google
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, There's quite a lot about it
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,If you miss a certain feel in your game you could try out a different wood
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, The internetz is really not your best friend when it comes to reviews or hints about finding your new set-up
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It is something very personal
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Maybe you should search a local dealer and go there to try some stuff out before bying
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, That's what I always do
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Don't rush it and especially don't let other people tell you what is better for you
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,My first custom blade was some andro carbon
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It was really really crap
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," No ""feeling"", nothing"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, But it was fast -> so my smashes were cool
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, But that was the end of the story Then I bought the Tibhar Samsonov Alpha (it's still quite cheap ~30  here)
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It was one of the best wooden blades I ever had
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," And now I have another (faster) all wood blade, which I bought after more than 1 month comparing"
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Carbon was just wrong for me
597,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,In conclusion: Try it out! 
598,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I had this problem with the T11+ using hard rubbers and I have 2 T11+ setups, Setup1- DHS H3 Neo(FH) and DHS Tin Arc3(BH) then I changed to Xiom Vega Europe Max(FH) and Xiom Omega 4 Elite Max (BH) "
598,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I am now more than happy as these 2 rubbers are soft and combine very well with the Stiff and fast T11+
598,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Setup 2 which I bought later is Butterfly Solcion (FH) and I kept the DHS Tin Arc 3(BH) which good for blocking and BH push as it is a none tacky rubber
598,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I think most definitely the soft rubbers on T11+ is very good for me

599,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,jpgI do not find it as glossy as my other teamates old rubbers and when I press my finger against the rubber I barely feel the tackiness
600,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Trying out different set ups would cost huge amount of cash and as a student I don't make much
601,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I took the decision to stop using H3 ( I have no photo I afraid) as it needs a lot of energy and technique to make it work properly so my H3 rubbers were in good state but gave them to my fellow players who could master them
601,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I have much more control with my actual rubbers be it soft touch or strong top spins/smashes
601,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I have a much more varied strokes now
601,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I think the Galaxy T11+ is such a rocker of a blade
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Why would it cost? Is there no opportunity in the shops?I walk into the shop (preferably with a friend)
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Tell them what i would like to try out
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, They glue it on a blade of my choice and me and my friend try them out
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, They have several tables there
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," As you see, I don't buy them"
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," They are ""test-blades"""
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I'm a student as well
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," The shop also has something which you can translate as ""test-bag"""
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, For a little fee 0
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,50 each rubber/blade or something like that you can choose 8 or 9 pieces and you can try them out
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, You have 6 weeks to decide
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Then you give it back
602,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," If you liked something you can buy it (of course you'll get a new rubber, not the one you and other have been testing) and then you won't even have to pay the fee"
603,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,then wipe it with a damp sponge
603,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, these rubbers are tacky therefore they pick up dust very easily
603,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, so even when you are playing it helps to
603,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, breathe/spit on the rubber and wiping it on your shorts
604,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Hi Blue,Things are not that easy in Mauritius, as we do not have specialized shops selling Table Tennis goods, it only the web which contains a great choice of blades and rubbers"
604,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,We are guided by great TT forums like this one and equipment reviews
605,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I'm afraid there isn't such a system in my country
605,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It's like you go to the shop choose your racket and that's it
606,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,you're from Mauritius at least someone who understands my dilemma
607,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I do wipe it after a few mins of use but as many are saying H3 is very tacky, I played a few people today and had a feel of their rubber and I could feel the tackiness more on their old rubber than on my new H3"
608,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Yeah right mate!Just save for some soft rubbers such as Butterfly Solcion,Xiom Omega 4 Elite, Vega Europe as I listed above and you wont go wrong"
608,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,They are long lasting rubbers as well compared to chinese ones
609,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"ouch those cost around $50+ a pop, I was looking for rubbers around half that price"

611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I'm sorry
611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Well then it seems like you have something you like anyway
611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Many friends of mine play with XIOM Vega Elitea and Europe
611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, They are pretty good and they are cheaper than butterfly (at least here)
611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, I often buy rubbers for them

611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,How are the prices over there in Mauritius?
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,its around 25-40 usd for xiom if you know where to look
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, skip vega europe
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, its garbage
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, also nothing is long lasting compared to chinese rubbers
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, fact
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, xiom tent to have pretty weak( structurally ) topsheets
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, bty somewhat stronger
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,also about that pic
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," they will be about the same tackyness = or - here and there, but you wont need to worry about it"
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, i would only advice on H3 if your arms are strong
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, if you can accelerate your swing pretty fast
612,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, if you cant get TG3 or skip the likes of hurricanes if you swing about as fast as this get skyline
613,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"You guys may not have specialized shops, But i live in america, We dont even have shops"
613,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," and places that do sell, sell very minimum,(because they are focused on ""sports"" )and don't sell any un-assembled products of any kind"
613,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"and the majority of the population looks at table tennis as a ""game"" T_T"
614,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"In your current skill level, I assume that's a yes"
615,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I get them for $35-$37 on the net
616,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I haven't checked prices in store but I wouldn't be surprised if they sell for like $60 since everything that sell here is almost double what I can get it for on ebay
617,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I don't know if you're talking about the serve(I suck at underspin) but I can swing at that speed when on attack
618,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,trust me it isn't only in america
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I think what has been said is that that is a very fast blade
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Too Fast
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"If you are finding the Hurricane not tacky, either you need to clean it more frequently, which is a problem with Hurricane"
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It is tacky enough that it gets covered with dust and stops gripping the ball
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Or, you have yourself a fake, which is possible"
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, There are a lot of counterfeits out there
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, If it is a real Hurricane then technique is a good part of the answer as stated above
619,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," If it is not a real Hurricane then, unfortunately, you may have been swindled"
620,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,It is too bad you read reviews and got something for yourself that was not really right for you
620,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Having a coach or a professional player who knows equipment see your game and recommend a setup that would be right for your needs is ideal
620,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," Unfortunately, not everyone has access to that kind of information"
620,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," So you tried to do your best with on line reviews and, it sounds like, you ended up with a blade that may be too fast and a rubber that is not working for your game"
620,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, How does the backhand rubber feel to you? Is that side at least okay?
621,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"what carl said, yeah when you attack,the thing is you everyone can swing fast once but can you follow up and keep doing it with accuracy and spinyeah stay away from carbon blades with huricanes "
621,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, they dont really like it hard semi flexi blades is what you want
621,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"in my opinion( because ive tried)Yasaka MEO + H3 will do for mid some far away from tableMEO + TG3 will work better for far away, but wont be as spinny as h3Rosewood + H3 , i couldnt get it to work from far away that well so best at close to mid distance from tableRosewood + Tg3( blue sponge) works from close to far away from tableHurricane hao + tg3 ispretymuch same as the rosewood option but with more dwell( more controll)Hurricane hao + h3 same as above you will need god power in your arms to make it work far off the tablebut saying that a fresh hurricane 3 neo or provincial feels so good on Hurricane hao "
621,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, and with intermediate technique will be easy enough to use the better your technique the more you can get out of your equipment
622,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I think I'm lacking some grip on the BH
623,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"hmm i can do 3-4 of them,beyond that I have high chance of errors but usually the point goes through on the first or 2nd strike"
623,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I searched Rosewood and Hurricane Hao and god they cost around $100 just for the blade
624,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,How can I know if it's a counterfeit?
625,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,also is H3 supposed to pick up balls like that 
626,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,yeap ! all of the hurricanes are very tacky and with good durability
626,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Mine is boosted 4-5 times and I am using it for the last 6 months
626,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, When I let a ball under my paddle for 5-6 minutes it can still lift it for half a second

629,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,i actually like innverforce al when i tried it with razka 7 and rakz7 soft
629,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, but other than that i wouldnt havea clue how it will go with Hurricane
630,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I believe that there is a number on the sponge side of the sheet that you can type in, on a DHS web-site and the DHS website will but tried to check"
631,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,well mine isn't boosted but it can't do that
632,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Should be able to do that regardless of whether it is boosted or not
632,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, Boost affects the sponge and expands the sponge making it softer
632,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers, It stretches the tophsheet but does not change the tackiness
632,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," If your Hurricane does not do that at all, if it does not grab the ball at all, it really could be a counterfeit"
632,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," In which case, it might just be a cheap rubber that is made to look like Hurricane"
633,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,make sure topsheet is clean first as well
634,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I think with harder rubbers all you have to do is swing with a quicker action, and the ball will come out quick and spinny"

635,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, I've got a Palio Thors and that's feels like concrete compared to the europe
635,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, What sort of rubber do you get well with that's softer?Shaun
636,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Ah, what xiom europe do you have vega or omega or another? I'm similar to you I find if I use a harder rubber like thors that I have to really hit forward in a longer arm stroke, what people call chinese, so I'm presuming your stroke is just grooved in a way that works better with softer rubbers maybe"
636,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, If you want to switch you'll have to regroove it a bit maybe with those rubbers
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I used to play with coppa silver or nimbus sound, so thats really soft"
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, Now I'm trying to play with the omega europe IV or something
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," And yes if you compare it with a chinese rubber its still ""soft"", but if you are used to rubbers like nimbus sound, coppa silver it is a really hard rubber"
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," The main reason I want to play with harder rubbers is because most players in my club told me that I can play harder and with more spin, another reason I would like to play with the omega europe is because of the black sponge"
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, It just looks cool
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Another reason I want to change is donic,stiga or joola keep on making new rubbers and they stop making the old ones, like they did with the coppa silver"
637,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," So I think its better to change to Xiom or Tibhar, but none of the rubbers really suits my playing style it seems"

638,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,ur question is why can't you play with harder rubbers? perhaps you've built a preference for softer rubbers
638,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," I find that having used soft rubber for the last 5 years such as torpedo soft, rapid dtecs soft, tibhar nimbus soft and sound and other similar rubbers, that I don't like playing with hard rubber I find it lacks the feeling that I can achieve with soft rubber and without feeling in my shots I tend to play muccch worse "
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,The contact on the ball is so different from Soft rubbers to hard
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," I have played with The softest like Nimbus Sound, Nimbus Soft being the one i played with longest"
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, I have played equally as long with T05/64
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, and I even played quite a while with chinese rubbers tuned and untuned
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, I adapted to all without taking too much time
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, But i can honestly say in my opinion and experience that Softer rubbers offer the least to your game
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, They produce the least spin by quite a fair bit and really dont offer u much more control
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, They do however provide u with fantastic feeling especially if u liked soft rubbers before
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"As for short game, the harder the rubber the better the short game yes"
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, You can get more spin and the same if not more speed from your shots but they just simply require a different contact point
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, All in all with practice the harder rubbers will offer u more
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, But at the end of the day it is what ur most comfortable with
639,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,On a side note the omega europe has black sponge? What about the red sheet? what colour sponge does the red sheet have?
640,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"@PingPongPom I think I did create my strokes for softer rubbers, but because lots of people telling me that I might play better with harder rubbers I thought I would give it a go"

641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,Just keep at it
641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, Your problems are similar to mine with soft rubbers
641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, They dont last as long
641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, Although I have another problem with soft rubber which is the FAKE spin
641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, Its easier for opponents to return shots from soft rubbers
641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,You just need to keep at it and eventually u will learn the strokes and contact points in no time making your entire game better

641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, How hard it is compared to tenergy?
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,For me the omega europe feels harder but it probably isnt
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, It just has a different feeling than tenergy if you know what I mean
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," For me tenergy was easier to play with but I cant really compare the two rubbers because the tenergy rubber was about 3 months old and the europe is new, so its a diffent feeling"
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," I like it when rubbers are a little older (2-3 weeks is perfect to me), they are alot easier to handle then for me"
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, Season for us is almost over so after that I will give the europe a decent try and see how it plays
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, But why a softer rubber on an off- blade is faster for me than a harder rubber on a carbon blade is still beyond me

644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,Don't worry so much about it
644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, I've been using hard rubbers for quite a while now
644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,and no doubt they create a lot of speed
644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, You must adjust your timing with the transition from soft to hard rubbers
644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," The ball does not have a hang time with hard rubbers, and so to create spin you must have a greater acceleration upon contact to create the extra spin"
644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," Good luck buddyBtw, I use Stiga optimum carbo with Stiga boosts TP and Xiom pro"
645,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,I practiced a few more weeks with the harder rubbers and now im starting to get the hang of it
645,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, I even think the rubbers I got now are to soft I think it just needs time
645,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," Im playing with the vega elite on the FH and first I thought it was to hard now I think its too soft, so im going to change to a little harder rubber"
645,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, Maybe i will take the xiom pro or europe on my FH
646,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Fair enough, let us know how it all goes "
647,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I saw the Difference between the Soft and Hard Rubbers, After saw this discussion I searched about Soft and Hard Rubbers and I found very inserting and positive view about Soft and Hard Rubbers"
648,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,I find that using a more wrist movement while swinging during a loop helps produce slightly more dwell time with a harder sponge thus creating more brush and spin
649,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I've heard that blocking with hard rubbers is easier than with soft rubbers!True or rubbish?I think it depends if you feel more comfortable with soft rubbers or with hard rubbers, or am I mistaken?"
650,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,@RhydianI think it is true
650,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," With soft rubbers you need to move your racket towards the ball in order to get it over the net, with harder rubbers it is most of the time sufficient to just hold it in one position and let the ball hit the racket"
650,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, This saves 
651,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,soft rubbers are the ones that helps you find your feel/touch

653,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,True for me
653,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"The hard rubber provides less dwell time for the ball, so the ball bounce more quickly and the rubber is less affected by spin"
653,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,This makes both passive blocking and active blocking easier
653,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"However, this is only my opinion "
654,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Nevertheless, out there may also be people who block better with soft rubbers than with hard ones"

657,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,a blast from the past hehe I can't play with soft rubbers
657,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," I find that when I hit the ball, I can feel the ball as if it was hitting all the way through my blade"
657,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," I can get spin, but there's no pace in the ball"
657,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers," Also, I hit with a closed bat, most of my shots ended up in the net if I am far from the table"
657,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers, I noticed that I have to loop the ball quite high over the net to make it to the other side
658,5f687a42887afbc97df8392e,Calibra LT Spin vs Calibra LT Sound,"Spin is, for me, somewhat better because of more speed and spin"
658,5f687a42887afbc97df8392e,Calibra LT Spin vs Calibra LT Sound," But yes, harder sponge "
659,5f687a42887afbc97df8392e,Calibra LT Spin vs Calibra LT Sound,"Yup, the spin is harder"

661,5f687a62887afbc97df83942,DHS Skyline 3 Neo vs. Hurricane 3 Neo, H3 is a balanced all around meant for mid distance to close to the table
661,5f687a62887afbc97df83942,DHS Skyline 3 Neo vs. Hurricane 3 Neo," Skyline is also mid to close, but with a slightly higher throw angle making it more susceptible to attack in its short game"
661,5f687a62887afbc97df83942,DHS Skyline 3 Neo vs. Hurricane 3 Neo, Skyline 2 is more for the close to the table attack and short game although with the right blade you can make up for the lack of mid distance

676,5f686c0cb59794ca78c70929,Butterfly Tenergy 05 or Tibhar Evolution MX-P?, MX-P is a bit harder and more linear
676,5f686c0cb59794ca78c70929,Butterfly Tenergy 05 or Tibhar Evolution MX-P?, Basically you largely get out of what you put in which can make it a little more predictable in certain situations than Tenergy 05

688,5f686c10b59794ca78c7092c,Innerforce ZLF with 05 or 05fx ?, A lot of control and spin

691,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,"T05 Is spin king,T80 is in between T05 and T64,a combination of speed and spinThat's according to butterfly"
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,"T05, the pimples on the topsheet are shorter thicker and closer together which gives it a slightly harder feel"
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?," T64 the pimples are taller, thinner and spaced further apart which gives it a softer feel"
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, T80: the pimples are shorter than T64 and closer spaced than T64 but taller and further spaced than T05
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, The sponge and topsheet on all three are the same
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, The only difference is the pimple configuration
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, That is what gives these three rubbers different playing characteristics
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, I personally like T05 better than either of the others for FH and I like T64 and T05FX equally for BH but for some reason just don't feel T80 works for me
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, T05 has a higher throw angle
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, T64 has a lower throw angle
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, T80 is in the middle
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, T05 supposedly gets the most spin and is slower
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, I don't feel it exactly that way
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, On big swings I feel like T05 is faster
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, On short swings like banana over the table you can let the ball sink in more and get more spin from T64
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, So I would say that T64 works better for smaller strokes and T05 works better for bigger strokes
692,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, But they are really all close enough that they all are outstanding rubbers even if I like T80 less than T05 or T64

694,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,I use T80 for my FH and T05 for my BH
694,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, I feel this combination works better for me since I put more emphasis on power with my forehand and can put more spins based on my strokes
694,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?," For my BH, the extra spin and high throw works great for my BH flips and reversing pushes"
694,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, I tried using the opposite rubbers but it messed up my game so I'm sticking with 80 fh and 05 bh lol

696,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,Using both at the moment
696,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?," Like some posts above, 05 has more spin, but is also more sensitive for incoming spin"
696,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, 80 is less sensitive for incoming spin and has more control
696,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, You can also check the below video of Butterfly about the differences of the Tenergy rubbers:
697,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,"Hey AndyCouchman,Tenergy 80 is the ideal balance between spin and speedEven faster than Tenergy 05 and offering the same speed as Tenergy 25Tenergy 80 enables all-round topspin play, attack and counterattack regardless of your playing style Tenergy 05 is a very fast rubber"
697,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?, Its unique spring sponge makes the ball catapult hard off the rubber but the best part of its speed is when you combine it with spin
698,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,"I play with 05, so I'd recommend that one"
698,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?," But you should try and find someone to try the rubbers from, so you can decide for yourself "

702,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?,Sponge thickness would affect how easily the ball reaches the wood
702,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?, Think of this scenario: A blade without a rubber and a blade with a rubber with any thickness
702,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?, The naked blade would absorb less energy due to the hardness of the wood
702,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?," The blade with a rubber would absorb more energy, thus resulting in a short bounce"
702,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?," So the thinner the rubber, the fastest the ball would be spit out of the blade"

718,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, It sounds like you should not be using Tenergy on backhand anyway based on what you do with your backhand
718,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed," If you push, drive and smack but don't usually loop, you should try a different rubber"
718,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, You could try something like Xiom Vega Europe or Elite
718,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, But it also sounds like you might do better with short pips on your backhand which would enable you to smash much more effectively
718,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, There is really not much point using Tenergy on your backhand if you don't do what it is intended for and there are other rubbers that are much better for how you do use your backhand

720,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,9 in 05 or 05 FX should also be fine
720,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed," The question would be, what makes you want to change? Is there a reason? Are you unhappy with your current setup? In what ways? If you like your current setup, there is no need to change"

720,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, If you switched to 05 you would get used to it
720,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, For your BH it does sound like you might do well to hit with a pro and have him watch you play a match or two to see if what you are using is good for you or if there may be something else better

722,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed," T80 works great for forehand everything But the type of game you describe for your backhand, I would recommend short pips or some soft feel rubber that really allows you to do anything from smacking to looping to pushing"
722,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, Rasant Powersponge or Tenergy 05-FX 2
722,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,1 mm would be great
722,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, But it all depends on what you prefer

723,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, I pull out of smashes too because I can see the fizz on the ball and know it will bite hard so I play the safe option to chop down on it
723,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, My doubles partner kills me for it  I find with this setup I play my best ping pong far back from the table as any spin has faded enough for me to topspin it back from either flank at will
723,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed, I would rather come out on top closer to the net and am guessing harder rubbers will be less vulnerable to spin when there is less pace on the ball?
724,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,Hey guys I went ahead and slapped on a T05 and T80 both 1

727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", I am not sure which is faster but they would have different feeling and they are both close to the same speed
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", Maybe TBS is a little faster
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", But sometimes that is not 100% consistent when blades are that close
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", You could have one Maze faster than a particular TBS and not as fast as a different one
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", The speed is pretty close to the same and so the feel is more important than the speed here
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", Do you like softer top plies or harder? But more people seem to like the TBS than the MMaze
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", Not sure why
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", I like both
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", I like the Innerforce series more than either
727,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?", ??
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,That will be a very top heavy blade if you choose T05 or T64 for both the forehand and the backhand
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, T64 is faster than T05 and pushes shorter than T05 meaning it is less sensitive to service spin
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, T05 has more control than T64 and if you like to attack the service then I find it better for the backhand
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, It all depends on your technique
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?," If you use a European style you probably want T05 on both sides, but if you have a more Asian style T05 FH and T64 BH is a popular choice"
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, If you have a Chinese style I'd recommend a Chinese Rubber on the FH like H3 Neo or Skyline 3 Neo
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, I also like the 729-5 or 729 SST God Favored (blue sponge) as a FH rubber
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, Then for the BH you could use T05 or T64 depending on how much you enjoy using your BH
728,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?," If you prefer to get into BH rallies and have a strong loop T64 is better, but if you enjoy your backhand but do not have a strong loop T05 is better suited"
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,Pls dont misslead him
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,T05 and t64 are both looping rubbers
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, I used to play tbs and t05 on both sides and now i changed my bh rubber to t64
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,For long movements with a fast arm stroke t05 is a bit faster then 64
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, If u use a short wrist movement and dont use that much of a swing u will get allot more speed out of 64 since its much more springy
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,It all depends on your techniqe
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, I like to play countertopspins not too far from the table with my backhand
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, So i really could use both rubbers even though 64 is better in mid distance
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, Since i adjusted my techniqe and i only use short movements and go over the ball i just get allot more out of the ball in a shorter time
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"Im trying to play my backhandtopspin like allot of female chinese players do it in there backhand rallies, quick stroke over the ball to play a fast dangerous return that leaves ur opponent less time to react (I think some males play like this aswell; zhang jike oh sang eun and so on)"
729,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"If u prefere wide backhands with a larger movement ( Ovtcharov, Boll or Mattenet) u will prefer t05 which is more sensitive but more controllable"
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,If the setup is head heavy with Tenergy on both sides it will be more top heavy with H3 or Skyline on one side and Tenergy on the other since those Chinese rubbers weigh more than Tenergy
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, But there is nothing wrong with head heavy and there are a lot of people out there who use Tenergy on both sides with a Timo Boll Spirit or an ALC or any number of other comparable blades
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, Dan uses TBS with Tenergy on both sides
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?," Everyone I know who uses a combination like that, and I know a few, really likes it"
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, And I think the H3 NEO or Skyline NEO on the forehand with Tenergy 05 or 64 on the backhand would be a great combination as well
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, You can look at my set up in my signature
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"  I am using a blade that weighs the about the same as TBS and I have used Tenergy on both sides (64, 05)"
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, I have also used Skyline on my forehand and now am using H3 NEO
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, All those combinations have been good
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, In the end it really comes down to personal preference
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, When you are a good player you adjust to the equipment you have as long as it is good equipment
730,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?, And over time you find what will be best for your own game and technique
731,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"Im currently using stiga clipper wood and its about the same weight as a TBS or might be a bit heavier, but i have no problems with the weight"
731,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?," I have been using T05 and T05fx for about 2 years on both sides, i think i'll stick to it"
732,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,@ Carl - I run the dealership at my club and I've weighed tenergy and my sheets of H3 Neo
732,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?," I've weighed skyline 2 neo, but have not had a chance to order in some skyline 3 which I really want to now that Ma Long has switched to it not to mention Wang Hao "
733,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"T64 is softer, faster and good for backhand while T05 is spinnier and more control which is good for fh"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"Tried all of them, Genius sound and genius+ optimum sound are harder than the nimbus soft/sound and Energy xtra rubber"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound," Compared to tenergy, the genius rubbers are a little softer"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, The express 1/2 rubbers were rubbish for me
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound," They got some weird catapult effect, when you try to loop a heavy backspin ball, they make a high throw and I always played them over the table"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,Nimbus soft is a little slower for me than the nimbus sound
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"Lots of people in belgium play with genius sound on the forehand, its a very decent rubber and I think a good replacement for the tenergy rubbers"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"So if you like harder rubbers and you dont want to pay too much, I would say go for the genius sound"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,If you like just a little softer I would go for the genius+optimum sound
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"And if you want to go for a lot softer, take nimbus sound/soft or the energy xtra"
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,But if you like the feeling of tenergy then nimbus will be way too soft for you
734,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound," Because for me it feels like a glued samba rubber, which used to be the softest rubber I know when speed glueing was still allowed"
735,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,Thanks for the reply
735,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, Nimbus Soft is my all time favourite and most fun rubber with the best feeling for me
735,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, But the durability was bad for the price of it
735,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,Nimbus Sound was softer than Nimbus Soft
735,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, I prefer Soft
735,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, So the Genius Sound and Genius+ Opt Sound are both harder sponges than Nimbus Soft?
736,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,and also just wondering what the 'sound' is like when hitting the ball
736,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, The 'sound' from Nimbus Soft was so nice
736,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, Nimbus Sound was nice too but very high pitched
737,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,Yes they both have harder sponge than nimbus soft
737,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, I tested them both on a primorac off- blade and they didnt make much sound
737,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound," I play without boost or glue or whatever there is, so maybe if you boost it you might get some clicking sound"
737,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound," Also it feels like the genius rubbers are slower than nimbus sound/soft, but its probably not true"
737,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, I think the nimbus rubbers have a catapult effect which makes me think they are faster
737,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound, But the genius rubbers are harder so they must be faster
738,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"Genius also produces much more spin than a Nimbus, Nimbus is perfect for blocking, Genius rubbers for a topspin game "
739,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,These genius rubbers generate a lot of spin

741,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?, Generally I am a fan of heavier blades and harder rubbers
741,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?, But this thread doesn't really answer whether you need a booster except for one post that indicates that
742,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?,I never really saw the point of getting these rubbers unless you want H3 like rubber without boosting
742,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?, Nittaku versions already weigh like a brick and boosting will make it way too heavy

745,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?," Secondly we don't rate the rubbers with the same scale in terms of the rubbers speed, spin, control etc"
745,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?, for instance a beginner might rate a rubber 10 for spin just because that person never tried other rubbers
745,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?, The ones you should trust are the reviewers and experienced players here in the forum

751,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I have mixed feelings about the EL-S
751,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I just don't seem to get when the catapult kicks in
751,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Maybe I hadn't given it enough time

753,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Isn't the Tango really soft? I pretty much don't know anything about Joola rubbers
753,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, How was your experience with the Rhyzer series?
754,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"Could there be a fitting Fastarc series rubber for my backhand? I really like the review on the fastarc g1, but I also like to match my FH and BH rubber's brand"
754,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, (I know it sounds odd )
755,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Sounds like you really don't like the catapultiness of 45-degree (or harder) rubbers
755,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, In this case - why not keep it simple and put a softer 42-43 degree rubber on both FH/BH? Both your spin production and control will increase for sure
756,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"GT is a very hard Chinese-hybrid rubber, 54 deg, tacky"
756,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, GT PS is its softer and bouncier version (50 deg)
756,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Both with monstrous spin capabilities
756,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, They most likely use one of Rhyzer sponges

757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I probably cuold have expressed myself more precisely
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I like linear rubbers
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I basically liked everything about the H3
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," If it weren't for the extremely low margin for error, I would still play it today"
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I just don't like if the catapult sets in unexpectedly
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, The T05 is actually kind of bouncy at any impact speed
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," The MX-P and especially the EL-S is good in the short game, but both have their catapult setting in at weird speeds at different hit angles"
757,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, So I should've written that I like linear rubbers

760,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,How Baracuda is much more durable is beyond me
761,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Fastarc G-1 as forehand and Fastarc C-1 as backhand
761,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, C-1 has a somewhat softer top sheet than G-1 as well as a softer sponge
761,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"If you want even softer than C-1, maybe Xiom Omega VII Euro or Vega Euro"
762,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I also like the pairing of Victas V>15 Extra and V>15 Limber
763,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"For spin, always Tenergy 05 or R53"
763,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, R53 creates better spin in service
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I have tried tenergy 64fx and rozena both 1
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,9mm on the BH side
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, The Rozena rubber is really nice and about 20euro cheaper
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Rozena is like a little brother to 64fx very similar but a tad slower
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Im sticking with rozena for BH for sure
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," I will also follow this thread since Im in the same situation ""finding replacement to H3 neo"""
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"OK, so based on your input, I will further look into the Fastarc G-1 and the Xiom Asia variants"
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," The Fastarc G-1 seems to have really good control and short game, as well as being linear"
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," But I don't know about its spin production - especially on slow loops and the serve, my strengths"
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"If anyone has more input, I'd be more than happy to read it"
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," In any way, I will try to get my hands on some on those rubbers to test them"
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Cheers guys 
766,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"Also:I found another post in which someone explicitly suggested the Fastarc G-1 as a slightly slower, more linear, less bouncy replacement for the T05"

767,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Maybe they provide enough additional margin for error
767,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Have you tried them? Has anyone tried them?
768,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I gave it a thought
768,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, but thats all I did
768,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I've read that ppl still boost it and I'm not very fond of boosting
768,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,My current standpoint is xiom omega v asia/nittaku fastarc g-1
768,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Will try either one when I have worn out my current H3
769,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"FAG1 is very spinny on slow loops, and can produce tons when serving"
770,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I have seen contradicting views on this
770,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Though, I would like to believe you "
771,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,G-1 is a very very good no nonsense rubber
771,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Spinny and quite fast
771,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Durability is also pretty good for a made in Germany rubber
771,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Maybe not as exciting as T05 or MX-P (the first 2-3 weeks) but very solid
772,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,C-1 and G-1 produce nice spinny serves but they are not very fast rubbers
772,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Both are excellent rubbers if one values both spin and control without sacrificing too much speed
773,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I eventually decided to go with tibhar mx-s
773,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Placed an order today 
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I decided to give the MX-P another chance
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," I applied a layer of Falco Long Term Booster to regain its lost liveliness (after 1 month of heavy use, though it dipped in performance far earlier)"
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Now its faster and spinnier again; even has moer control for some reason (might be the softening effeect of FLTB)
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Still have the same problem of it sometimes hitting the net or overshooting the table, but those are errors in my technique"
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," After I applied the booster, I immediately played better the next sessions"
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Althoug part of it might be psychological in nature, most of it should be the rejuvinated rubber"
774,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,For now I won't look into any other rubbers - as that doesn't fix technical weaknesses
775,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,MXS
775,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"It generates more spin than MXP, a little bit slower than MXP"
775,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, It has softer rubber surface and harder sponge
776,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,R53 hands down
777,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Mantra M is great in a different way because it's japanese made
777,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Other than that, thumbs up for G-1"
778,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,did you boost it after like a month's use and do you even use it on backhand?
779,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"I saw you say you will look into vega asia, but you said that you dont want something to bouncy"
779,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Vega Asia is very bouncy, almost like mxp 50 hardness"
779,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I find vega x much less bouncier and spinnier
779,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, These are the 2 rubbers I have tried that you mentioned
779,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Hope it helps
780,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I am using it on my FH
780,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, It's been about a month and half
780,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I have not boosted it and it's still a spin monster
781,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Yeah man same here
781,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I am using it on both sides it is just something else
781,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,So much speed and spin
782,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,The sponge is hard to keep the service short
782,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, But the topsheet is so soft I can feel every shot I hit
782,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, That's the best thing about it
783,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I feel like it has the ease to loop underspin like tenergy 05 and we can even power loop like hurricane 3
784,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I agree
784,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Looping backspin is an ease like T05!! Short game and service is way better than T05
784,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, In counter loop I feel the ball so much
785,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I play around 5 days a week
785,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, And I am feeling a lose of grip after around 7 weeks
785,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,What are your thoughts on durability?
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I don't play as much as you do
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, You can probably try boosting it
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, R53 reacts really well to boosting
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, How do I know?I still use speed glue exclusively
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, When I first got my brand new R53
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, I put a layer of speed glue on it
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, It curled up visually
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," If it reacts to a layer of speed glue, it will likely react to booster oil"
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,For FH in the price range I would suggest:Rasanter R47
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Its not as fast as MXP or Tenergy, but great in a short game, fairly linear, spinny on short or full strokes, and great control"
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play, Works very well short and mid distance
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"Another option is Gewo Nexxus EL Pro series, 48, 50 or 53"
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," I used 48 on FH and BH, but prefer it on BH"
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," Suggested it to a friend who used MXP, and he loves it"
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"Another one I've used and like is Xiom Vega Pro, but I think above rubbers are better"
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play," I don't like Xiom Vega Europe at all, too soft even for BH in my opinion"
788,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,Depends on your level and control
788,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?, A 1
788,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,9mm dignicscan still go fast at middle distance
789,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"Just curiosity, should you really be using such a rubber if you still worry about control? "
790,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,Anything can be controlled with a bit of getting used to
790,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?," But whether Dignics will allow him to do anything he can't with the Gewo, that's debatable"
791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"The reason I worry about control is not because I can't handle Dignics, I've played with it on different blades, its very controllable, but because I like certain feel of a rubber on my BH and on my FH"
791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?," So maybe ""control"" is not the right word"
791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"For example, I do not like T05 1"

791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"9 felt fairly soft, so I am not sure how it would fit Viscaria"
791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?, Plus Dignics 05has way more control than T05
791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"Level wise I don't have an issue handling T05 or Dignics05, but i am roughly 1700 US, and I don't think I NEED it for my level"
791,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?," However, I have some gift cards to burn, so I've decided to try it"
792,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,So I got black and red Dignics 05 2
792,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,1
792,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"Honestly, so far (3 hrs), rubber is a breeze to control"

793,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,I fully agree each rubber feels different on different blades 
793,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,and i have one blade which is not good in feel with dignics but perfectly fits with Cornilleau Target Pro GT-H47 and opposite on second blade where dignics feels perfect and Cornilleau not

801,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Moving from a tensor rubber to another tensor isn't gonna help much
801,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," If you are so adamant on spending $, either you need to change to Chinese rubber or a slower non-tensor classic rubber"
802,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Is there a noticeable difference between the ""updated"" version as they call it and the original topsheet?"
803,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Still looking for more info on Gewo Nexxus EL Pro 50
803,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I have been using Viscaria with EL Pro 48 on BH and Rasanter R47 on FH for about 3 weeks now
803,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," My short game improved drastically, pretty much immediately after switching to Viscaria"
803,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," I also feel like EL Pro 48 would fit my FH better than R47, however, R47 is working very well right now, but I feel like I can handle slightly more power with EL Pro 48, and it will give me slightly more control"
803,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,So still wondering if EL Pro 50 would fit my FH better than 48
804,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Every company has a 50 degree tensor rubber these days
804,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Way too many to choose from and they probably all play somewhat similarly [when comparing touch play]But if you want something less bouncy for touch play then maybe try a 50 degree hybrid rubber like JOOLA Golden Tango PS
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I have EL Pro 50 2
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,1 on FH & EL Pro 48 2
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,1 on BH of a Mizutani ZLC
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, I have used 3 other max sheets of the 48 before
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,EL Pro 50 is the best FH ESN rubber I have used till date
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, It is different from EL Pro48 - different topsheet
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," Also, it is more powerful, has more spin & most importantly: it's throw is fairly stable as you increase power (unlike the EL Pro 48)"
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Very grippy
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Bites well even with ABS balls (unlike MX-P 50)
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Great for looping against underspin (unlike MX-P 50)
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," Ball stays on the paddle longer than most, if not all rubbers in its class"
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Medium / high throw in powerloops (unlike R50 which has medium / low throw)
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Only thing (for my game I find the 48 better for is (deceptive) serves using a head-high toss (48 is the best rubber I have used for this attribute)
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," With the 50, serving spinny requires a higher toss & better technique"
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I like it more than Tenergy 05 Hard
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Hope this helps
806,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"It does help, thank you very much"
806,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Have you tried Gewo Nexxus XT Pro 48 (or maybe the name is just XT48)
806,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, How would it compare
806,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," I really didn't like it, very linear, couldn't loop well with it at all"
807,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"No, I have"
807,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Not tried the XT series but have not heard good things about it
808,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Would you say that 50 is a looping rubber, similar to 48?Also, as far as the serve goes, I think the high toss works better with 50 because the sponge is more engaged on a high toss"
809,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,EL is your R while XT is your V in terms of Gewo/Androand I also think trying EL 50/53 should work for you
809,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I like personally like harder sponge for FH
810,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Thank you, makes sense"
811,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Yes
811,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," R(otation) and EL(asticity) for spin oriented game, V(elocity) and XT(?) for a more direct, speed oriented game, with lower arc"
811,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"For many, an R/V combination might make sense if the forehand is the spin weapon and the backhand mostly used for blocking and countering"
812,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,FlexTech = XTElastic Rubber = EL
813,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,That´s it
814,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,50 is a power-looping rubber - sort of like H3N
814,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, 48 is looping rubber so long as you don't hit too hard
814,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, I do high toss with both 50 and 48
815,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Can you please explain about 48 what do you mean by open rubber as long as you don't hit too hard
816,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"What I mean by it being a looping rubber so long as you don't hit too hard is this:When you hit too hard, the throw drops so you get a bit less of an arc"
816,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Still not too low - more like medium
816,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," On soft to medium-hard loops, it is medium-high to high throw"
817,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Oh, I am not the one who has this issue"
817,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," I experience this whenever I am in loop to loop rallies with soft rubbers, after 2-3 loop ball ends up at net"
817,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Very irritating
817,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Sent from Tapatalk
818,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Hey Slevin,Have you tried Gewo Nexxus El pro 53? Would you think it will be even better or too hard?"
819,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Both nexus 50 and 53 are bouncy
819,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, They don't feel hard
819,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, They are just firmer and they don't bottom out
820,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,how do they compare with mxp 50 and joola rhyzer pro 50?
821,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I didnt play with any other 50 degree euro rubber
821,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, But gewo 50 and 53 felt firmer yet still bouncier and more elastic than regular mxp
821,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Mxp topsheet and gewo topsheet are really different
821,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Mxp feels a lot direct and flat
822,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,What do you mean by saying that mxp topsheet is a lot direct and flat?
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Mxp's throw angle is low
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, It feels harder
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, It's not that bouncy
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," Gewo 50 and 53 topsheet felt softer, throw angle is higher"
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, It's easier to spin sliced balls
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, But gewo 50 and 53 sponges are firmer
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Overall gewo 50 and 53 doesn't feels like really hard
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, The are just firm
824,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,So mxp 50 feels harder than gewo 53? Thats interesting
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Hello ,I hope im not too late"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, there is my advice
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"I have Xiom Omega 7 Tour Rubber on FH , im loving it"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, It is easy to smash 3rd balls come topspin on the table
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," I mean , it has very low throw angle, very hard rubber"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," Beside that, it is not bouncy"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, you can serve short
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," if you receive , you can send the ball short near file "
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, This rubber is different than others
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," somehow, it works like this, when touch soft, ball goes short, when you hit, it is lightning  "
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," And i had a little research on gewo rubbers; As much as i understood , EL type rubbers are Elastic , its like Tenergy Tensor rubbers"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Not like Omega 7 tour above  but XT is not bouncy
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," i think if you insist to use Gewo, you should prefer XT series rubber"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Best RegardsEJ Ibrahim
826,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Have you ever tried a tacky rubber?
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Hello again,I am still looking for the ""perfect"" FH rubber"
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," Tried Yinhe Big Dipper, loved it, but its a bit too slow"
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Now I put Nexxus EL Pro 48 2
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"1 in hopes that it will be less bouncy, and it is slightly, but very unpredictable"
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I am seriously leaning towards getting DHS Hurricane 3 Provincial (Blue sponge) as I loved Big Dipper
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, My other thought is to try Yinhe Apollo 5 before I go Hurricane route
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," My only concern is that I am not getting any younger, and Chinese rubbers require full stroke"
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," I can still do it, my movement and stroke are fine, but don't want to change in a few years"
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Again, suggestions are welcome"
828,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Try Andro Rasanter R53
829,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,If you're in the US try Gambler Burst Thor's Hammer
829,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53," Less bouncy and more spinny than Big Dipper, faster than H3N, but no factory boost so performance doesn't really change over time"
829,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, Mildly tacky and the tack doesn't fade
829,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, I use it unboosted and love it
830,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"How different is it from R50? I have a sheet of R50, but it is supposed to be very hard and heavy, good spin, hard in short game"
830,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53, How is R53?
831,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Havent used R50
831,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,But can compare to mxp50
831,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Feels softer than mxp50,higher arc and more spin"
832,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,I'm always a fan of Yinhe Jupiter II
832,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," Commercial version is decent quality, no need for provincial/national nonsense"
832,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," Also, R37 is really soft and mushy"
832,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice, Maybe R42 might be a better fit for backhand
833,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Bryan,Actually all (4) of these rubbers would be for practicing the loop forehand via drills, blocking, robot, etc"
833,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," So none of these rubbers would be for the backhand stroke at all, just dedicated practice paddles"
833,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," I had thought to put spinny rubber on both sides so that I can more easily switch back and forth to see which one would be the easiest to brush/spin--and not buy 4 paddles!i'll def take a look at Jupiter II, the price is great"

836,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," I have a NIB Sanwei F3 Pro, would that be an acceptable alternative?Takkyu,of the rubbers you listed, is there a particular order/preference for spin capability? I would probably not consider T05 at this point as I did play with that back to back w/some H3 and the H3 was much easier to brush for me"
836,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,most certainly due to my inexperience
837,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,My advice is practice with what you will use in a match
837,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," There is no merit to ""training rubbers"""

840,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," Yeah, I also recommend trying a hybrid tacky rubber as one of your four rubbers"
840,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice, I've tried JOOLA Golden Tango PS and liked it
840,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice, But there are so many others too
840,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice, Yogi_Bear is probably the expert

841,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"BryanY,How about Donic Barracuda? It also looks like the Hurricane 3 National (blue sponge) is even better than the regular H3 for spinning purposes"
841,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," At this point i'm not even focusing on precise placement, just a medium or slightly higher swing speed and trying to get the brush stroke down--verifying by watching ball response when it contacts the table as well as the sound when hitting the ball"
842,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Well, Barricuda is not a tacky rubber"
842,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice, If you you are interested in a tensor rubber then there are more modern options that are better than Barricuda
842,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice," Also, my understanding is that the benefit of the H3 blue sponge is that it absorbs more booster than the orange sponge"

845,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,I think you need to try to decide which rubber you want to use
845,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice, Do Not need to brush the ball as much with tacky rubbers because of the grip

889,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Anyone?
890,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Why not read some reviews on the two rubbers? Nobody seems to want to compare them
890,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, What makes you want to try these? Why do you want to boost them? It seems from your thread about boosting H3 that you don't really know how to boost yet
890,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, H3 really benefits from boost
890,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, These rubbers may not benefit in the same way from being boosted
890,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, How long have you been playing? What blade do you use? What rubbers are you currently using? Can you give an estimate of your level?
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,When i posted that i had never boost before
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Here in argentina boosting is not that common
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Argentina has 7 categories and i am in the second highest
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted," Been playing forn6 years now, 18 years old male"
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Previos set up before testing h3 was viscaria with t05 on both sides
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, I loved the low throw of the boosted h3 and was thinking that these two rubbers would be out of this world woth just a layer
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Tried many different rubbers across the years
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, But argentina is going through a crisis and spending 40-50 usd on a rubber and not liking it would hurt too much
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Also there must be someone who tried this
891,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted," I would really apreciate experiences rather than opinions such as "" a harder would be better to bost"""
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,I don't get it
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, You loved H3 but want to try something else? That makes no sense
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted," If money is tight, either the T05 you were using or the H3 you just recently bought and boosted should be fine"
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Either Mantra H or MXP 50 should be excellent too
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, But this sounds like and EJ issue
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, And the EJ virus does not go well with being low on funds
892,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, 
893,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Yes you are right
893,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, But the thing is i never used chinese rubbers before
893,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, And maybe the reason why i loved it so much was because it was boosted
893,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, I bought the h3 because my forehand t05 was dead and know im close to changin my backhand t05 and i thought that maybe these where cheapper yet great choices and boosting may make wonders once again
893,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Tenergy here cost 80 usd and mantra or thibar i can get for 50USD
893,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, and i allready have the falco tempo long
894,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,I should have said that earlier it is for my backhand
895,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Why are you thinking of using something so hard for your BH?
896,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Probably you should get something like ELP if it is for your BH
896,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Regular MXP may be a little hard for BH but you could try that as well
896,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, MXP 50 would be better for FH than for BH unless you have really giant impact on your BH loops
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,"I have tried both, boosted with baby oil"
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, I find mxp50 boosted superior in every aspect
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, But i prefer the mxp topsheet over the mantra one in general
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, I also didnt like baby oil on mantra h
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Did not feel right to me
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Mxp50 felt good on bh too
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, However id personally did not risk to play it BH in official matches
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted," Countertopspin, topspin and over the table play feels really good"
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Opening up could be hard on BH
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Depends on your technique of course
897,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, On my FH i did not have big issues since the topsheet grips the ball so well
898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,I think you can use both But i Do not think you should use booster
898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Booster is fine if you only want to win now But if you want good developement and win against better players in the future skip the booster
898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, As a coach for kids i think really fast rackets ans especially booster is like learn to use calcuator instead of learning Math
898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, More of way to try to find a shortcut
898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, I would try mantra H
898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, I use rakza X and like it so Maybe that would be an option
899,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,So i can boost
900,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Thank you for sharing your experience!
901,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,I tried rakza 7 and didnt like it much
902,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Okey
902,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, Rakza x is harder
903,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,"I've tried MX-P 50 and MX-S boosted with Falco Tempo Long, MX-P 50 sponge reacts much better to booster than MX-S"
903,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted, From an average rubber turn to something much better
903,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,If MX-P has the same sponge as MX-S I'd suggest to try MX-P 50 boosted
904,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,what thickness is your MXP? Max might make it more difficult for flat hitting
904,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, In any case I doubt you would need MXP for a 290
905,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"Go with Rasanter V47 or V42 for flat hittingMX-P is also good, but not forgivingSent from my ONEPLUS A6010 using Tapatalk"
906,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,If you Like the mxp topsheet try Mxp50 for flat hitting
906,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, The sponge has small pores
906,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Therefore more direct less catapult

908,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,I use the maximum thickness for the MXP
908,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Despite the very fast blade (and rubber), the ball tends to go in the net with fast flat strokes"

910,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Im really considering the R47 now
910,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Seems to have better durability according to figures and reviews

911,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Did you try to flip your racket and hit it with Vega Europe? IMHO for hitting flat the softer the better
912,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Good idea! I will try that first and see what happens then
912,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, (though I need a new FH rubber)
913,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"you have a fast blade, in order to take advantage of the blade speed the ball have to engage the wood so thicker and harder rubber will prevent that unless you do a full power swing"
913,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, if you are willing to switch rubber then Mantra H (as recommended by Yogi) 2
913,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,1 should be good - it also has very good control
913,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, For more spin (than the Mantra H) Xiom OAV is also good
914,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Thank you very much
914,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, I will look up both rubbers mentioned
914,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Never heard of Mantra H, but I think one of my clubmates has Xiom OVA, so I can give that one a try"

917,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,My clubmate mentioned with Xiom OVA just emailed me I should look into the Xiom Omega VII Asia or even the Xiom Omega VII Tour

917,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Will try anyhow soon 
918,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,OVIIA (I haven't played with it) is meaningfully more expensive than OVA
918,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, From what I read the VII is faster
918,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, BTW I played with my 290 yesterday and it is fast even with a Tibhar Aurus Select 1
918,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,9 - didn't have a chance to check the power as I was rushed into a match (with my normal blade)
918,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Think you would have to assess whether you are look for power or speed on you ""hard flat"" strokes"

919,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, I think I should be carefull not to make the mistake that more is (always) better

921,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, You have a sort of hit the ball firmer and/or adjusting the angle of the blade and that means to much adjustment/training to my opinion

922,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Do you value speed or power more for you hard flat strokes and what it the weight of your 290
923,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, and do you tend to full swings when doing flat and loop drives

924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,The weight should be sufficient for that kind of strokes
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Reading a lot these past days I start to believe that the plastic ball plays a large part in this whole dilemma
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," I used to play, in my younger days, and at quite a high level, with Tibhar Spico Spin (FH), combined with a Charly Roesch blade (very fast) and the hard fast stroke was one of my game best asset"
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, But
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, besides it was like 30 years ago (46 nowadays) and both are rubber and blade not on the market anymore
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"I really wonder if even if I had that combination again, this kind of shot, like I have in mind (trick of the mind"
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,) would still be possible with plastic balls
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"Anyhow, I will defenitely want know what is possible with nowadays materials (rubbers)"
924,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,And not just buy OVA or Mantra H

930,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,5% ESN with your requirements in mind and see if I could discover anything helpful
931,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,I said the 290 is at least 90 grams
931,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Mine was about 94
931,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, I do not think the average of all blades is 86 since you do not have the data of all lade weights and try to average the weights
931,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, It is more correct to say that the acceptable weight for a blade not being heavy is about 85 to 86 grams
931,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," QUOTE=Harry070;274722]No, the average of all blades is 86 grams"
931,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, The 290 (approximate) 97 grams
932,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"Harry, any progress on your new rubber search?"
933,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"My current main setup is with Xiom O7Asia, but I've played a lot and still have and use setups with OVAsia and OVTour"
933,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"My experience is that all these are very good for flatters, though their real strength is not there"
933,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"For me between them the best for flatters is O7Asia, followed by OVTour"
933,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, They both excell OVAsia in that department
933,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"OVTour is softer and feels more stable with flat blocking, but in general is a more difficult rubber and the flat smashes have to be executed with a greater precision"
933,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, So for an overall flat play I would recommend Xiom O7Asia over OVTour and OVAsia
934,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"how about spin for those three, especially on brush strokes"
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,They all are excellent for active spin play but are different in style and performance
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"OVAsia is with hard sponge and hard top sheet, it has less catapult, higher top spin arc than OVTour, back spin arc is almost the same as the top spin"
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Best for brushing with a full swing stroke
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Maximum spin is obtained with thinner brush
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Better controll in allround game and over the table
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Easier
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"OVTour is softer than OVAsia, it has lower top spin arc and higher back spin arc"
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, It has more catapult and compared to OVAsia the spin is produced more mechanically as the ball penetrates deeper
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," O7Asia is with the hardest sponge, but with softer top sheet"
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Excells in spin in both worlds - mechanical with softer strokes and thiner brushed with harder strokes
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," The catapult is stronger than OVAsia, but weaker than OVTour"
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Fastest and for me the best spin
935,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," With the remark that spin depends not only on the rubber, but on the player style and how its style fits with the rubber properties"
936,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Thank you
936,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, This question was more for the OP's info
936,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, I myself use mostly mechanical spin
937,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"The OP is interested in flat hitting, so I must add some remarks - OVAsia is more sensitive than the others to the incomming spin and thats why I don't recommend it here"
937,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," OVTour is less sensitive and is best for passive blocks, but because of the narrow rebounce angle the flat smashing needs better accuracy"
937,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, O7Asia has the best ballance in performance in the flat play
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,'OVII pro didnt work me
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Very good for hard hitting, the flat strokes and smashes, but couldnt make the kind of spin Im used to"
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, The way Im used to scratch the ball with MXP to deploy the spin cant be done that way with OVII
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, You have a sort of hit the ball firmer and/or adjusting the angle of the blade and that means to much adjustment/training to my opinion
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Probably the combination, the already very fast 290 and this kind of rubber isnt working (for me at least)"
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, benefit doesnt counterfit the effort so to say
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"Will look again for some less fast and more spinnier rubber, and try again"
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," And yes keep me posted on your deployment of the 290 too, I would like that""Langel, please see above"
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, he elaborated a bit more on his requirements
938,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Regardless,I am sure your information will be helpful"
939,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"OK, I missed that, thanks"
939,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"And now, having in mind the above, I would still recomend O7Asia"
939,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"I'm not a fan of the Pro line neither in Vega, nor in Omega family and I can agree with the OP"
939,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,It doesn't mean that others can't feel better in an opposite way
939,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"And a little remark - with modern rubbers ""less fast - more spin"" is not a rool"
939,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Fixing only on sponge hardness doesn't work too - the ratio of sponge hardness&thickness to topsheet hardness &thickness is what matters
940,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,What about MX-S?
941,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,O7Pro is better on flat hitting spin drive
941,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Smamshers will love it because it is better when you sink the ball into the sponge when you smash
941,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, It is spinny but not as spinny as 7Asia
942,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"On mine identical Foco off+ I currently have and use O7A, O7P, MX-P and a Primus"

943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, I have not been playing for a couple of weeks so I almost forgot about this discussion
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," Last Thursday I played with Xiom OVA and as mentioned by others already, the sponge is to hard and probably topsheet as well"
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, To be honest I couldnt play my normal topspin game to be able to set up any chance for any flat hard hitting at all
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," I probably got already so much accustomed to it, that I forgot how its missing when it is not there"
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes," I put back on MX-P my old rubber, but due to all changes recently I didnt good at all"
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"Funny though, my clubmate who has playd a variety of Xiom rubbers of the Omega range, and also plays with a Stiga 290 Carbon frame, tried my set-up, and though the rubbers are pretty worn out (but fresh glue), did play remarkably well with the MX-P"
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, He even considers buying MX-P now
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, I guess I have to accept that hard flat hitting is not that much a part of my game anymore (only when considerebly high) and have to accept that I have to play those kind of shots in a more controlled manner with some spin
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes, Most of the time a direct scored point anyhow

992,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH), I used short pips on a hard blade (no dwell)

995,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),It depends on other factors like sponge to topsheet hardness and thickness ratio and it depends on the strength of the catapult effect
995,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH), I don't like stronger catapult for lifting backspin
995,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),Speaking of Xiom tensors - Vega Asia DF has less catapult than Vega Pro and has a slightly softer and slightly grippier surface
995,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH), For these reasons I find it better for lifting

997,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"I would choose R42 over EL-S anytime, grippier"
997,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH)," And any Tenergy FX over R42, lasts longer"
998,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),If you are using baracuda i would suggest using MXS instead
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),About MXS i learnt to fh loop with that
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH), (I started with a chinese battle2)
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH)," My coach said those rubbers are too hard to delop my looping technique, so i changed into elp on fh and baracuda on bh"
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH)," Elp is good for me (thinking to change with r42, for more grip) but id like to try something else on bh"
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH)," I played vs a good player (now is old, but in the past he played in the 2nd Italian league) and he said that the bh is my best shot, so i want to make it very consistent in the first topspin (normally vs backspin balls)"
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH), Any suggestions??
1000,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),Why not use the same rubber on both wings so you can develop both more consistently?
1001,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),So r42 for both sides? Or which?
1002,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),Which ever one feels best to you
1002,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH)," If you prefer EL-P or Baracuda, stick with one and slap the same on the other side"
1002,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH)," If you want something grippier, R42 will be good"
1002,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH), Then work on your technique
1003,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),another option is andro hexer grip
1003,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),It is spinny and gripy as the name promises and is 45° hardness but the feel is much softer

1014,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?," If your forehand stroke tends to be ""thick"" (directly and pretty straightly in the ball), you are more European style, so you should stick with tension rubbers like donic jo gold/platin x1, andro plasma or BTF bryce speed, BTF ternegy"
1014,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?,"However, if you tends to hit the ball ""thin"" (more friction, less power, hit the ball on edge), you should consider chinese rubbers because those generates speed basing on spin"
1014,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?, This first sounds ridiculous but try it and feel it
1014,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?," Remember, most importantly, when playing Chinese rubbers, the technique must be altered"
1014,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?," You should throw your entire forehand body (including arm, waist and shoulder)"

1048,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, I know the price is not comparable but in my experience Tenergy lasts easily twice as long as MX-P without any performance degradation so in the long run Tenergy seems a better buy at least for me
1049,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,So it should be easy to adjust from MX-P to T05H then?

1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Sure, if you are playing at a very high level, and have been using the same rubbers for a long time - There will be a slight adjustment when you change rubbers"
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"But for the vast majority of people, the change isn't particularly big, and can be overcome very quickly (a few hours at most)"
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,This is assuming that you are sticking with a similar rubber of course (not changing from Tenergy to Hurricane for example)
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"On the ""durability"" side of things - I too find that Tenergy lasts around twice as long as most others I've tried"
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"If you can afford it, it's a no brainer in my opinion"
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"That's not to say there aren't some really great rubbers for a fraction of the cost (because, there are)"
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," But I'm happy to spend twice as much on something that gives me 10% (at most) more, whilst lasting twice as long"

1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,I'm sure there will be a few who just don't get on with it - But the vast majority of people I've met would use it if they could

1051,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,The most economical solution for near-T05 like characteristics is a boosted Donic Baracuda - even cheaper than MX-P
1051,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, Other MX-P substitutes: Gewo EL Pro 48 (similar throw and dwell as T05)

1052,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,I'll give T05H a try then
1052,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, Thanks to everyone for the help
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,Maybe UK has a special price on T05
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, But otherwise I don't see how there can't be much difference
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, For example you can buy MX-P from Dandoy in belgium for 33euro per sheet if you buy 4
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, As England is still in the EU right now there is no added tax etc
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, Shipping is free as well
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,If someone has a shop where they buy T05 from in UK for around the same price please let me know as I will order all of them

1054,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," Having used MX-S for a few months, I liked it on the forehand, and would have no problem using it"

1055,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, Then you are paying £28 extra

1057,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," Plus, given the fact it lasts longer (in my opinion), you are probably only saving £10 over a whole year, as youll have to replace EVO rubbers more often"
1058,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,I agree
1058,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, It's about priorities
1058,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," I value quality, and it costs more obviously"
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Ok, I get your point"
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"But as others said, its not £10, but £28, and £56 for a pair"
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," So if you change rubbers once per year its £56, and having in mind the galloping prices in GB its really not a big deal"
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, And yes - to everyone using only 1 set of rubbers annually I would higly recomend Tenergy
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, For 100 hours of passion annualy its really worth to pay the double price
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," I see it here the same - almost all of the guys, playing once weekly for an hour and a half, use Tenergy and don't bother about the price at all, as they change rubbers once per year or two"
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"But if you play 300+ hours annually and you change rubbers every 3 months, than the extra cost is going to £224 and begins to matter"
1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,I was playing 100+ hours a month in Korea
1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," One month was it for Tenergy rubbers, 3 months was it for Aurus, MX-P has same durability as Aurus"

1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, so a change of rubbers was $50-58 USD
1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, reasonable
1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?, but then price jumped to over $70 USD a sheet and that was it for me
1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,That was my price point analysis breaking point
1061,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"My calculation - while I change Omega rubbers /pairs/ on every 4 months, 3 times per year, they cost me £183 annually"
1061,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"But with T05 I have to change on every 3 months, 4 times per year, and they will cost me £412 annually"
1061,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"The extra £229 is equal to my annual club tax, or more than to double the Omega pairs, or to please myself with some good portion of EJing"
1062,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Sorry, but you are missing my point about it lasting longer"
1062,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," Its not as drastic as this, but for arguments sake, say I change my Tenergy rubbers twice per year, but Id have to change EVO rubbers three times"
1062,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," Tenergy = £112 * 2 = £224EVO = £80 * 3 = £240Now, its not quite as bad as that, which is why I said it would be roughly £10 more per year"
1062,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"But due to the fact I can play with Tenergy for longer, the extra cost is decreased when compared with other rubbers over a whole year"
1063,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Ok, in your case Tenergy proove better"
1063,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,Let the OP take his chance with Tenergy and share here his experience 
1064,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,But now to have real quality rubber you can't even have T05 anymore
1064,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?," As more expensive = more quality, So now it's 100 dollar per sheet as everyone will have to use Dignics 05"

1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,Haha - I'm not sure Dignics will be on my blade anytime soon

1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,It's like when you go into a supermarket and look at the prices of things
1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,You'll see the headline price £5
1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"00, and then underneath you'll see the ""price per XXX"" - This is usually in weight, so it would be ""price per grams"" for example"
1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"The cheaper stuff is generally more expensive ""per gram"" - So you may think you are spending less, but you'll have to do it more regularly"
1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"In these instances, it's better to spend more, and your overall spend will be less (as you'll need to buy less of it)"
1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Now, I don't see Dignics being this for the record - I see Dignics as a marketing exercise to see just how far Butterfly can push the boundaries!I also don't see how it can be the much better in terms of quality/speed/spin over Tenergy - The ONLY reason I'd buy it is if it lasted a month longer than Tenergy"

1069,5f68742ef57afe037caed0b2,Should/can I re-glue my rubbers?, The only tricky part is to place it back dead center
1069,5f68742ef57afe037caed0b2,Should/can I re-glue my rubbers?, I usually place it 1mm towards the leading edge (left on BH and right on FH) to avoid wood sticking out and splitting balls should they hit the edge there
1069,5f68742ef57afe037caed0b2,Should/can I re-glue my rubbers?," You shoul glue the rubber the same way you remove it - from bottom and up, ideally pressing it down with a roller"

1070,5f68742ef57afe037caed0b2,Should/can I re-glue my rubbers?,"If you want regluing your rubbers, they will shrink for sure, so you have to boost a little bit just for expanding and ensure to keep pressing after gluing, and when they sticked strongly you can cut the broken side"

1074,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?, T05 offers more safety

1092,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,I didn't know that Timo had changed his hairstyle
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,It depends on many factors and players
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,I can only compare ten05 fx vs 80 fx
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?," Generally, 80fx is more controlable than ten05 fx"
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?," Ten05fx has higher throw, little more spin in topspin"
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,But everything else was better with t80fx
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?," Better receive, short game, blocks, drives, smash, topspin are quicker/little less spin/, better serve"
1093,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?, Also better spin for slow topspin/maybe due to thinner topsheet/
1094,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,David Luiz?
1095,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,"Yes, David Luiz, brother of Marouane Fellaini "

1104,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,i have a fun paddle
1104,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, It is a LKT Instinct with LKT Pro XT and 755 0X
1104,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, I can chop or play push blocker style with it
1104,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, My fun paddle is a compromise but it is easy to use
1105,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,"I would recomand Bomb Talent , if you master it you'll be a hated player in good terms "
1106,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,"I ordered also 2 sheets of 755 OX to build a fun paddle, you can try it! it's very cheap!"
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,The hard part will be gluing the 755 0X to the blade
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, The 755 0X will curl up into a ball and be unusable unless you first tape or pin down the corners when applying the glue
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, Wait for the 755 0X to become relatively flat again
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, Then use a sheet of wax paper to put on the blade and put the 755 0X on top of the blade where you want it
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, Pull out the wax paper a little at a time so only a small part of the rubber become in contact with the paddle at a time
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, Make sure the rubber attaches smoothly without bubbles
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, Then pull out the wax paper another little bit
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, I think there may be a YouTube video showing how to do this
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,If you want to have fun with your second sheet then put it in the sun to age it
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, When it starts to smell it is done
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, It may take a few days depending on how bright the sun is
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, I put mine in the back window of my car because where I work the back windows faces south
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, It is also easier to tell when the pips are done by the smell in the small confines of a car
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, If you wait too long the 755 0X pips will be frictionless but brittle so they will break too easily
1107,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, This is a cheap way of getting almost frictionless 0X LPs
1108,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,Tape/pin the corners of the OX sheet down
1108,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, But don't have to wait until it flat
1108,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, Just wait until it and the glue on the blade dry then put the blade on the OX sheet
1108,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, This reversed process works perfectly
1109,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,Don't u think that there would be NO fun in practice vs
1109,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips, short pip chopper or frictionless LP pushblocker?
1110,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,I did try short pip chopping but it was hard
1110,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips," However, LP chop block combined with chopping is fun and this is my style now"
1111,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,Glue sheets are my preferred solution to 'gluing OX' stress
1112,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm,"""Enough"" speed is a very personal thing"
1112,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, Genesis II is pretty different to Mantra - it's slower and semi tacky
1112,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm," The tackiness might make more of an impact on your game than the basic speed, so best to take that into consideration as well"
1113,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm,I would rate Genesis II as tacky
1113,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, Very different to the original Genesis
1113,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, Not as extreme as H3 Neo or Battle II but still tacky
1113,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, It's for sure slower than than Mantra M
1113,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, I've played with both Genesis II M and Mantra S on the backhand and even Mantra S is a whole lot faster
1113,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, It's also worth to mention that Genesis is quite spin sensitive so the receive game will be impacted
1114,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm,I got it
1114,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, Thanks
1114,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, Thats what i wanned to learn
1114,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, Im focuse on backhand winners usually
1114,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm, So genesis ii not so effective rubber for me

1119,5f687481f57afe037caed0df,Durability: Tibhar Evolution/Donic Bluestorm/Andro Rasanter,Well i think the mxp is best when u playing purposes if u want speed and more punch from your setup but i think the r47 and bluestorm lets say a little more easier to use because of the new spong technique(u can go for hexer powergrip or aurus prime too in this case)
1119,5f687481f57afe037caed0df,Durability: Tibhar Evolution/Donic Bluestorm/Andro Rasanter, when it comes to durability i think andro has an advantage on the other two companies

1123,5f687483f57afe037caed0e1,Has anyone boosted Stiga Mantra H/M?,)?
1124,5f687483f57afe037caed0e1,Has anyone boosted Stiga Mantra H/M?,Well it was easier to block because the H version softened
1125,5f687483f57afe037caed0e1,Has anyone boosted Stiga Mantra H/M?,I think Mantra M is way too soft to boost
1126,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"If EL-P feels too fast, then MX-P is definitely too fast for you"
1126,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, Your blade is also very fast so yeah
1126,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"maybe ""downgrade"" to a more linear rubber like Vega Pro then work your way up"
1126,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?," You'll still have the same speed on loop kills and smashes, but it will be more controllable"
1127,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"If you find EL-P fast, I think you should not consider evolution series rubbers"

1128,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,Maybe FX-S would be better option

1129,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,So is it about rubber hardness?
1130,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Between the two, yes"
1130,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?," It has less catapult than MX-P, yet compared to H3 probably still too much"
1131,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"H3N is actually very pleasant to play at the beginning for 2months, but then the neo booster fades and the sponge feels dead"

1133,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,So is it about sponge hardness?
1134,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Nah, it's more about the tensor technology and how MXP is optimized to be fast and aggressive"
1135,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,So tenergy would not be a good option right ?
1136,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"It would be an expensive option, offering more catapult than your H3 but way less than MX-P - yet you would find similar characteristics in Vega Pro or maybe Stiga Mantra M/H, for a fraction of the cost"
1137,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Given what you don't like about ELP, MXP would be worse"
1137,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, I suggest ELS
1138,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Like others have said, MX-P would be the worst of the lot"
1138,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"However, I think you may find MX-S quite good"
1138,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"It feels closer to H3N (it is still quicker), but doesn't have as much catapult as some of the softer sponged EVO rubbers (you'll probably prefer it to EL-P)"
1138,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,It's hard to say really - MX-S would be a good option - But there is a chance that all the EVO rubbers will end up being too fast
1139,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,How bout spin art??
1140,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,Heard that xiom rubbers have very short life span and need to be replaced consequently
1141,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"A good option, there´s only the question why buy a costly Butterfly ""version"" of a Chinese rubber when you already have a Chinese rubber"
1141,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,Maybe there should be more info as for why the change shall be made in the first place 
1142,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Someone else has heard this about Donic, andro, Joola or Tibhar rubbers - but as they´re nearly all from the same factory there is no reason why one brand should have lesser durability than others"
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,The Xiom rubbers that I've used have held up pretty well
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, (Vega Europe DF and Omega V Asia)
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, Much better than Tibhar Evolution rubbers which always seem to flake off on the edges
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, If you want the least amount of catapult from a tensor then maybe try Xiom Vega Intro
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, It's less expensive too
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, As far as sponge hardness goes
1143,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?, That depends on whether you impact the ball hard enough to compress the sponge

1146,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,I've heard that the Acuda S2 is a good alternative
1146,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, But I haven't tried the rubber myself
1146,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, Perhaps someone else can elaborate
1146,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,I have used Big Slam on Forehand and Backhand as well and switched also because of the same reason 
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"Well maybe someone who's played with both would be the best deal for you, so if NL reads this im sure he could answer more precisely"
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, IIRC he played with both
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, But until then i'll try to helpout
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?," See, i haven't played with the Barracuda nor did i play with Barracuda big slam, but i've had the Acuda S2 on my racket for a session of 2 hours, but tore it off after that session 'cause i found it too bouncy for my likes"
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,Its so called catapult effect just came too surprisingly and not linear
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?," So after that session i went back to my old Bluefire M2 for a week, and then switched to T05"
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,But since you seem to have trouble reading spin i hear very good things about Xiom Vega Pro
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, Maybe you can find someone who uses it and lets you try it
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, I've also had a hit with Baal's Karis M which was also very easy to handle
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"But then again there are NO SHORTCUTS  in TT and it will help your game much more if you would learn reading spin better, so changing rubbers might not be the best solution to fix your problems when receiving spinny serves"
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,Rather try to find a good server and try practicing with him a lot
1147,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, And i really mean A LOTGood luck
1148,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,I agree with what you say Suga
1148,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, The only problem is that I found the Baracuda topsheet to be extremely spin-sensitive
1148,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, I think the only comparable rubber would be T05 in terms of spin-sensitivity
1148,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?," I have played with rubbers that are supposed to be sensitive to spin (Vega Pro, Fastarc Series, MX-P, Tenergy 80, Rakza 7) and none of them came close to the Baracuda in this aspect"
1149,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,Tenergy 80 is a very nice rubber
1149,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, If you want something cheaper your could look into vega pro (harder and heavier) or vega europe (softer and lighter)
1149,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, I transitioned between these rubbers without much adjustment
1150,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"Rhyzer 43 (outright power & spin) or Aurus Select (consistent, higher throw & good control)"
1151,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"Thanks a lot guys,it sounds like I am going to try Ten 80 then"
1151,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, We'll see how it goes
1151,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?," As far as reading spin, even if I know precisely what kind of ball is coming I STILL find it hard to return serves"
1151,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, I think the Baracuda is just too sensitive for me
1151,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?," But again, on the flip side, I love that popping sound when doing top spin with the Big Slam"
1152,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"For a like for like replacement you would look at Tibhar Genius Sound and Andro Hexer Powersponge, as these along with Barracuda are from the same generation and share many characteristics"

1152,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?, Genius Sound or Optimum Sound gets my final vote for a direct replacement
1153,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Battle II is the best tacky chinese style rubber currently available
1153,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," It's kinda like H3 but a lot faster and great for drives too, while being tackier also"

1155,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Battle II is surprisingly good
1155,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Tackier than h3 national blue sponge
1155,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, I find speed is about the same
1155,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Throw is slightly higher than h3

1168,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,You can play with it unboosted perfectly well
1168,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," The topsheet, it seems, never wears out (if you clean it always and cover tight with plastic sheet), so you can break it in without fear of losing performance"

1172,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, I imagine 38 battle 2 to be very viable as a BH
1173,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,the orange version?
1174,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Many 729 Friendship rubbers have differently colored sponge for red and black side
1174,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Black rubbers usually are for FH and red rubbers for BH
1174,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, I think 729 is the only brand that does this
1175,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"No, there are two versions of the sponge like with the 'blue sponge h3 national'"
1175,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,That's what he's asking about
1176,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,indeed coz the blue the top sheet is a little thinner and sponge is thicker and orange the sponge is thinner and the top sheet is thinker
1177,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,729 B2 (45°) commercial out of the wrapping
1177,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Seems quite boosted 
1178,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,I never ever saw a dome like this in any sheet of B2 I ordered
1178,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Where did you get it from?

1180,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Co-owned by the English national coach
1180,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, I have no doubt that it's a legit product
1180,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Just to clarify
1180,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, This is without any booster applied to it
1180,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Straight out of the wrapping
1181,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Never saw this with any of my sheets

1182,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Boosted rubbers arch the other way though, I'm confused"
1183,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,wow i never had that happen with all 3 versions and how did you add the picture?thats a new one for me also
1184,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Good point
1184,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, The rubber was sealed in plastic so I guess that it must be some kind of reaction to the VOC used in the manufacturing process
1184,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, It's a fairly cheap rubber so I think that it's safe to assume that their QA process isn't 100%
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Some feedback
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, I'm extremely happy with B2 after an initial 1
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,5h of training
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Flicking heavy backspin serves is extremely easy
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, The short game is excellent
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, My backhand loop is very poor due to bad technique but the rubber was way easier than H3
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Not as linear as H3 (which I think is a good thing)
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,I'm amazed with how tacky it is
1185,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, The ball is pretty much fixed to the rubber even if I tilt the rubber to 45 degrees
1186,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Yup
1186,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Ppl don't generally believe how much of an upgrade it is over the H3Neo which it resembles in style until they use it
1186,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"It's faster period, while also having a sweet, very gentle catapult, while still being more controllable in the short game than any tensor, about twice as tacky as h3 no joke, great for drives, consistent in make, lasts forever"
1186,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"For anyone who likes tacky rubbers, I think they hit the sweet spot with this one, where everything just comes together perfectly"
1187,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"very much so , but the provinal versions keep on improving on it some how"
1187,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"beening using Lidu oil with the blue version the dwell time is long as , the best thing i love about it does what you want when you and how you want , and you wanna put the ball there it does it"
1187,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, just h3 is more alive to a degree

1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"I wanna share some about B2,I really love tacky rubber, but cause my inconsitensy technique and power im searching a tacky rubber with a more springy sponge like nittaku h3, spinart, mantra etc"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, But i keep searching cause i felt it quickly not so tacky anymore
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,I know B2 regular not with a spring sponge but cause its cheap enough so i try it
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," wow it suiteed my game very much, its just like a spring sponge on it , still good when close play & the tacky spinny top sheet last long enough"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," My drive, my loop, my spin, my power, felt improved"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,", Well overall B2 regular its just like H3 that i like but more suited / easier to use for me"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"From that moment i stick with B2, i tried B2 provincial (40 deg) but i felt not as good (the rotation) or easier to use like the regular one (maybe coz the sponge degree)"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," But still better compairing when i use h3 prov (40 deg), soon i'll try B2 blue sponge prov (39 deg) hope it feels like im expected"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Well i really not sure i have to be happy/not when people say how good about this rubber, im affraid when more people realise this rubber is really good"
1190,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, 729 will increase the price

1191,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,I have been thinking of B2
1191,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Just not sure if I should try the normal one or provincial one
1191,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, I have been thinking of Yinhe Big dipper after reading some good reviews
1191,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, Has anyone played with both B2 and Big dipper? Passionate about TT
1192,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Big dipper is a lot closer to european rubbers while B2 is a lot closer to traditional chinese rubbers

1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, amazing seller Well its kinda like Hurricane keep getting better with the versionsThere a simular rubber just things get easier to do things for me battle 2 is like a cross between Neo H2 and Neo h3 with resistance to spin with blue being the best 
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"The commercial has a crap topsheet so less then 6 months it will ware but i put alot of oil , but still works okay also the best thing about it can take a beating with oil but it lacks hitting threw it and lacks spin"
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Things get alot better with Battle 2 provinal imo its a better neo h3 prov and the top sheet lasts and everything increases some how ,just like hurricane does just the only negitive a little dead feeling depending on the person and a tad lack of spin"
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, The Blue is just the best the only negative is you loose a little control dueing to it being like 39
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"5 degree but gain everything 10-20 % more spin its alot more alive , unless 729 release a national version im going to stick with the Blue for me the only other rubber like this national Neo h3 BS just a cheap version and it does the job"
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,the Battle 2 prov orange version is better in 39 degree then 40 you are very right dons7er just loose a tad bit of power that the 40 has
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," oil has so many different feeling , iv used Haifu seamoon , Haifu black oil , Dan chi , Lidu oil yellow imo lidu is best for its price but i havn't Haifu yellow oil coz of better feeling in lidu and dont loose anything"
1193,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era, and i hope that kinda made sense
1194,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Compared to Battle 2 (only tried commercial 47 deg), BD is:- less tacky (but still enough for a solid short play);- significantly higher throw, comparable to that of H3 (my sheet of B2 has medium-low throw)"
1194,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Regarding hardness, 47 deg B2 is similar to 38 deg BD when fresh, but BD tends to lose factory boosting quite fast (approx"

1194,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era," Also, ALL Yinhe sponges I've tried do not hold the booster well, and BD's is not an exception"

1221,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,always wondered what sanwei a+ tacky felt like
1221,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,if you consider tibhar evolution mx-p (which has some stickiness when new) then by far this would be my favourite chinese style rubber
1222,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"To all you guys in this thread, what is the main reason for you to play with Chinese rubbers? And why did you start using it? "
1223,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,tg3 national blue sponge (fh)yinhe moon pro (bh)i like them for the following reasons :- linearity- spin- control- honesty
1224,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,number 1 is price-chinese rubbers are much much much cheaper than euro/jap rubbers2
1224,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,i like spin and speed that chinese rubber provides i played for a long time with euro rubbers but that rubbersjust dont fit to me 
1225,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,XP 2008 Super Power for a Euro/Japanese style control rubber
1225,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,999 topsheet custom glued to a sponge I like for something more dynamic
1225,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,H3 NEO for that same category
1226,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Ok thank you for the answer, of course it´s very individual"
1226,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I will give some chinese rubbers an honest try in the weekend to se how they suit me
1227,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Razzz, if you discover a USD $7-$8 rubber that plays with the control similar to Sriver and lasts a LONG time, you would like it too "
1228,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Haifu Blue Whale II and Tibhar Grip-S are good choices for the FH
1228,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," I think for the super inexpensive, solidly decent rubber for the BH, Der_Echte's Dawei 2008 XP Power Sponge is as good as you can get for the price"
1228,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"By the way, I think there is a reason why so many of the top Chinese players use H3 or Skyline, but I did not list either in my choices because you asked for rubbers other than them"
1228,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I used Dawei Saviga a long time ago and that was pretty good
1228,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I don't think they make that anymore
1228,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, But Dawei Inspirit is pretty good as well
1229,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,haha you may have a point 
1230,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Tibhar Grip-S and DHS Memo
1231,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,have tested Skyline
1231,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, good spin but I have difficult with the chinese sponges
1231,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, i get no speed
1231,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, good in teh spingame
1232,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"With Tacky rubbers that have hard sponges like Skyline, where you get the speed is by having good bat speed and brushing the ball"
1232,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," The sponge does not give you the real speed, the topsheet does"
1232,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," When you do it with a certain technique, the ball goes"
1232,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Not good for smashing but excellent for brush-looping
1233,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,my technique on the forehand is not that strong
1233,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, then i follow why not i get the speed i thought that i should get
1233,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, any rubber you can advice that help me with the speed?
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,I am looking at your profile says your blade is
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, You have listed:Butterfly Timo Boll Innerforce ZL
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Since there is no such blade but there is a Timo Boll ZLF and an Innerforce ZLF, I am going to ask you, which blade do you have"
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I don't really need the answer though
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, That blade is too fast for you
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," If you can comfortably say that you realize your forehand technique is not that great, then you should probably be using a slower blade to help you improve your technique"
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Why? You are using fast equipment hoping it will make your balls faster without having the technique for the blade
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," If you use a slightly slower blade it will help your technique improve, it will improve your stroke and then you will start getting more power"
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Put the ZLF blade, which ever one it is, on the shelf for a year or so, and get a blade that is better for your developing your technique"
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Here are four great options:Yinhe Galaxy 896 blade (only $16
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,00 USD but it is a pretty good blade)Stiga Allround Evolution (approximately $40
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,00)Stiga Tube Allround (approximately $45
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,00)Butterfly Primorac Off- (approximately $70
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,00)Which one is about personal choice
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," The interesting thing with this, the most expensive one is definitely not the one I think is the best even though they all are great blades for any player who is below 2200 USATT rating level"
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," In other words, until you are REALLY pretty darn good, these are excellent blades for most players games"
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, What rubbers should you use
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, What your profile says you are using should be fine
1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," You just need to work on good strokes, proper contact of the ball, in short, technique, technique, technique"
1235,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Thanks for detailed reply
1235,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, In blades I have a Timo Boll Alc blade
1235,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, just wanted to see if someone should notice my blade i had listed and you did 
1235,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"I will follow your recommeded choices of blades, think i will test Stiga allround evolution"
1235,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, $40 sounds price worthy
1235,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, thanks for great advice
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,That is really a great blade
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I used that for over a year and the only reason I changed to my current blade is that it was given to me by a pro who is sponsored by Butterfly who just had it and knew he was not going to use it
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Otherwise I would still be using it
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," If you are using a TB ALC, you will have to get used to the thicker handle from Stiga"
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Perhaps get a Master Flare rather than a Legend Flare
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, The Master is the slightly smaller flare
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, It will still be much thicker than the butterfly handle
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, After a few days you will be used to it
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I personally like both thin handles like Butterfly and thicker handles like Stiga
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Also, the rubbers you are using are good"
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, You don't need to change them if you like them
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," But if you wanted rubbers that are pretty good that cost $10-$15 less that are pretty comparable and have really good control, speed and spin, Xiom Vega Pro for FH and Xiom Vega Europe for BH is a pretty good combination"
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Aside from that, technique, technique, technique and you will get your forehand top notch"
1236,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," By the way, if you are interested in reading what someone else writes about trying that blade, have a look at this thread:http://www"

1256,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Indeed a bold statement coming from someone who changes equipment as often as I change underwear  Isn't that right Tompa?

1257,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," To add even more to the problem, it had a much lower throw than H3, so I couldn't close the bat enough to prevent bottoming out"
1257,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," And yes, the speed is also lower than properly boosted hurricane"
1257,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," To answer the question in OP - no one seems to come out with smth better than National grade DHS (choose the pip structure based on your style and natural stroke shape, go for Provincial if can't manage the Nat speed)"
1258,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Bold but true 
1259,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Battle 2 is actually the one rubber i have played the most with, yes i have tried alooot but still dosen't change facts"

1260,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, These come alive when boosted! I dont know what blade you use but its a killer on a spirit or viscaria that i currently play with
1260,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Both the 49 or the provincial 39-40 deg are really good
1260,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I have played with both
1260,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, the 49 is more or less the same as 39 in hardness
1260,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Every rubber can be a little bit different in hardness unfortunately, this includes expensive stuff like tenergy"

1263,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Battle vs Hurricane is like Tenergy 05 vs 25
1263,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"While maximum spin caps of Hurricane and 25 far above Battle and 05, because The 1st pair harder to bottom out, Minimum speed needed is also a lot larger, cause the rubber combi is harder for ball to penetrate, making 2 interesting situation, Slowhander like me and Tompa would say Battle spinnier than Hurricane"
1263,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Fasthander like National level athlete would say, H3 better"

1264,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Battle vs Hurricane is like Tenergy 05 vs 25
1264,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"While maximum spin caps of Hurricane and 25 far above Battle and 05, because The 1st pair harder to bottom out, Minimum speed needed is also a lot larger, cause the rubber combi is harder for ball to penetrate, making 2 interesting situation, Slowhander like me and Tompa would say Battle spinnier than Hurricane"

1265,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," There's a reason the CNT almost exclusively use H3 blue sponge on fh, and it stretches beyond any sort of sponsorship"
1266,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"I wouldn't say ""amateurs"""
1266,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," If i compare it to a provincial h3 40 and 41 degree, blue sponge (yes i have played with both) battle 2 has higher throw angle and spin"
1266,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, H3 has higher speed
1266,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I am refering to boosted state
1267,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Interesting! Have you tried it? If so how is it? Anyone got more info on this Dianchi D rubber?
1268,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,No I haven't tried because it's not cheap $35
1268,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I have read on Chinese forum
1268,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, A few provincial coaches were interviewed
1268,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, They said DianChi D is at least equal to H3 provincial BS
1268,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I will give it a try after my H3N dies
1268,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, It might take a few years Passionate about TT
1269,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Another point to take away from this; DHS rubbers have amazing longevity and durability
1269,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," ""You get what you pay for"", the classic"
1270,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Exactly
1270,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, A $40 H3 provincial can last you a year at least
1270,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, So the money is worth it

1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,My fav Chinese rubber was probably Geospin Tacky or Gambler Wrath
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Both of these were similar in that they were on pretty soft sponges for Chinese rubbers
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," I don't like hard, stiff sponges"
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I prefer the feel of something springier
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"In my experience while both these rubbers come crazy tacky when new, we're tallking being able to pick the ball off the table and hold it upside down for a minute or so, they, just like every other Chinese rubber I've ever had, can no longer come close to repeating that feat within a few days of playing"
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, I clean my rubbers & use protectors after every use
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Still same story
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, So in the end I always felt like I ended up with topsheets that are very grippy but no longer tacky
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Basically like euro topsheets but not as good of sponges
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, That's why I made the switch to some higher dollar rubbers
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Whew that was long winded
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Anyways, Geospin Tacky & Gambler Wrath play pretty nice even after the tackyness wears off as they're on nice soft to medium sponges"
1272,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Can generate a good amount of spin IMO
1273,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Genesis M
1274,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Are you using this one? Some distributors are selling it as 729 Battle 2 Provincial
1274,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Without boosting, is it comparable to H3 Provincial?Also, can you tell me about the durability?"

1276,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Yes, that one =) Durability is amazingly good! As long as you clean it time to time"
1276,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, As all chinese rubbers they collect dust more easily
1276,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Non boosted its slower but alot och control and very high spin
1276,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Higher throw angle
1276,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Boosted it really shines!
1277,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,Hahaha
1277,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, This made me laugh

1278,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber, Which DHS rubbers are closest to the Genesis M ? I'm eager to try Genesis M rubber on my BH side
1278,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," But based on my personal experience using DHS rubbers on BH, I don't really like the tackiness from DHS rubbers especially Hurricane series when used it on BH"
1278,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber," Do you think Genesis has the same feeling as the DHS rubbers on BH ? I've already seen your video review of Genesis M rubbers with Dan many times, but I'm still unsure to try that rubber out because I'm worried that Genesis M will give me the same tackiness feels of DHS Hurricane"
1279,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,My favorite chinese rubber is Palio Extreme CJ 8000 spin

1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,I tried them out myself the other day(a mutual friend happens to be have connections with the company) and it was just superb
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Loved it
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I tried it on my DHS MaLong5 blade and it did wonders
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Prior to the two(both Sunnysix7 & Sunnysix3), I used DHS Hurricane3(Provincial=ShengGuang) for my forehands and Tenergy64 on the back"
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,I would say the Sunnysix7 is a great substitute for Chinese rubber fanatics
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Fantastic spin and marvelous counter-attack
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, It gave my club opponents a super hard time  What really surprised me was the Sunnysix3
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I'm generally really agressive on both sides but I always wished that I had more stability on my blocks and counter-attacks(like FZD)
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The Sunnysix3 is just that
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Super secure
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, It gives you that great balance between Boll's machine-like stability
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I've always thought Tenergy64 was the real dealbut I kinda missed the depth and spin
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Tenergy always had great speed but it never really feels 'powerful' with the block
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The Sunnysix3 did just that
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," With the right channel expansion and marketing, I believe this company will do wonders"

1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Hopefully I'd be able to share some snaps and actually weight the rubber as well

1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Glad that I could give back in some way
1290,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, FYI I'm super picky when it comes to products

1291,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Really interesting to see a review from abroad
1291,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Sounds like what the company claimed is true!Both sunny 7 and 3 are released yesterday in Korea and I hope they would be great alternatives to DHS Hurricane rubbers
1291,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Would you share some snaps and weights of the rubbers? Because only the covers are available so far

Sunsix7 sounds like a great alternative but I'm already very very interested in the Sunsix3 for my backhand
1292,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, If you could share more details on the specs and pricing it would be awesome as well
1292,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," We'd really appreciate it! Provided that it also works for my game, I'd be really happy see a pricepoint somewhere around TibMXP or at least still much under the obnoxiously pricyTenergy"
1292,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," BTW a well known coach in my club once told me that his experience with the players using Chi-rubbers well was this: ""Chi-rubber players definitely have nasty spin"
1292,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The speed is definitely much stronger than that of Tenergy other mainstream German rubbers but it feels like you are hitting a gold ball on a heavy spin
1292,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, You can block fast/light shots but its harder when you defense or counterattack a so-called 'heavy' ball
1292,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,""" Merci"

1293,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,one thing I have learnt is to always go with a rubber that is accepted widely
1293,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,even the ITC rubbers that came out last years were poorly made
1293,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Far inferior from the same price Donic/Stiga rubbers
1293,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,This SunnySix rubber sounds appealing but I doubt it will be as good as what they say it to be
1293,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,(The terrible package make it more doubtful)

1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,1 expected for August
1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,The performance excels many other 47
1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"5 degree rubbers in terms of spin creation, largely due to a relatively soft top sheet on the explosive new (pink) sponge"
1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," In direct comparison, this new rubber generates more spin than the HYPE XT 50 pro and is only marginally slower, and it is faster and spinnier than the HYPE EL 47"
1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"5, but less bouncy and more linear"
1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"I would prefer this rubber to Evolution MX-P and EL-S alike, since it sits somewhere in the middle - the sponge hardness of MX-P, the elastic top sheet of the EL-S - and thus gives me the best of both worlds: Easy opening on underspin and maximum power on winning shots"
1295,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"With GEWO´s well established quality control, I am pretty confident that the finished rubber will perform as good as the factory sample, and that makes the HYPE KR a very attractive recommendation for offensive players looking for maximum spin and speed, yet need control on passive shots and in the short game"

1305,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Maybe he had an American attitude that leadership hated on real bad
1305,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, His posts on OOAK forum showed he had both classic Korean and American attitudes/beliefs

1306,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Some people thought his attitude was somewhat firm and hated it

1307,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Koreans do not have such an expression exactly
1307,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I have been active on forums for ONLY ten years and can say that the list of forums that died due to lack of control is HUGE

1310,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, (from xiom developer days to ITC's)his site was a platform to sell his stuff and recently people caught up to this gimmick

1314,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I tried out the Gewo on my backhand side and I loved how I was able to backhand loop heavy underspin balls very easily using this rubber
1314,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, It was very bouncy at first so I had to get used to it but I like the responsiveness I got with it
1314,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," When I get the sunny7 rubber for the forehand side, I will try it out and let you guys know"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,A quick Gewo Hype Kr review
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Having played with a tacky chinese rubber on FH on an off- class carbon blade for almost 3 years, the inner EJ has won and I decided to try some new equipment after the end of the league season in April"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Thought I'd give OSP Expert a try and put MX-S on FH and EL-S on BH
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Played 3 tournaments with the new setup since then
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"In short, everything Dan and yogibear wrote about MX-S/EL-S in their reviews is true"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Both rubbers are plenty fast even on the Expert and are very spinny
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, El-S in particular is a very nice rubber that is very easy to play with no matter how tired or how out of position you are
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," MS-S is awesome until you're about to play your 10th match on the day of the tournament and are feeling a bit tired :-)So, I decided to EJ a bit more and try something other than MX-S for my FH"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Tried EL-S but it felt a bit too soft
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Picked GEWO's Hype Kr and purchased a pair of sheets in max thickness in early June
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Since then I practiced about twice a week on average with the new setup, and here are my thoughts on Hype Kr"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"Anyhow, the gory details"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The first thing one noticed after opening the Hype Kr package is the booster smell
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, It is almost sweet and nothing like EL-S/MX-S
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The tuning effect is quite noticeable when rubber is laying flat with the sponge down - the corners of the rubber curl up a bit
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Visually Hype Kr looks almost the same as EL-S aside from the sponge colour
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The topsheet surface and the pips feel and look identical to me
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, The sponge structure and bubble size seems very similar as well
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Hardness-wise (under the highly unscientific finger press test) Hype Kr feels somewhere in between EL-S and MX-S
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Playing impressions: Short game: Hype Kr is very similar to both ES-S (and MX-S) in the short game
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Very grippy topsheet, similar spin sensitivity to EL-S"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Attacking shots: This is where the boosted nature of Hype Kr shows itself
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," I agree with Paul - Hype Kr is a very responsive rubber, definitely faster than EL-S, with much stronger catapult, and consequentially lower arc, longer throw"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I would even say it is at least as fast as MX-S on full effort shots
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Most importantly, much less effort is needed to engage the catapult as compared to MX-S"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Spinwise it seems to be just as spinny as EL-S on slower loops and as MX-S on faster loops with full sponge engagement
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"TLDR: IMHO, Hype Kr is a very interesting rubber with a lot of potential"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Ideal target audience - players with good technique who need a spinny and fast rubber, with strong catapult effect, that retains the best properties of both EL-S and MX-S but is easier to play with than MX-S"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"I am about to play two tournaments, which ought to be a real test for the rubber"
1315,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Will do a follow up afterwards
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Thanks for the review
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I feel very similar to the way that vvk1 does here
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, What I really like the Gewo more and more I use it is the fact that I can loop any ball very easily
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Some of the people in my club were surprised at some of the balls that were coming back to them
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, My backhand has improved dramatically using this rubber
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Blocking is also good with this rubber and it does have a longer throw so shots have to be placed or it will fly a little long
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,<br>Now as for the sunny7 rubber
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I would like to share a couple of things about it
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," First, it is very tacky similar to the hurricane 3 neo commercial or the whale 2"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," When bouncing the ball on my OSP Virtuoso, the ball basically dies after one bounce and gets stuck on the rubber"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," I felt that the throw was very low and the hardness was around 39-40, even with booster it felt harder than my hurricane 3 neo at 39 degrees"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I was afraid that the ball would barely make it across the net
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," However, after the initial couple of hits, I could settle in and hit some massive topspins"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, You will definitely need to use a lot of force in order to use this rubber
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I talked to the SunnySix representative via phone because I was so curious about the rubber and he told me that they were basically trying to copy the rubber that Ma Long and the Chinese National Team uses which is the Hurricane 3 blue sponge
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Although I have never used the blue sponge, I have used the provincial, commercial and the nittaku hurricane 3 neo and I felt that the throw was lower than those rubbers"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Blocks were fair easy especially when the opponent is hitting that ball hard as the power basically gets reflected back to them
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," However, you do have to put a little force behind the shot or else it will go into the net"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Also, if you brush the ball too much, the ball doesn't go very far so you do have to put impact on the ball"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," All in all, it is perfect for people like me to like to hit very hard especially on the forehand with a lot of spin"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," However, if you are the type of person who wants the rubber to do some of the work for you, I don't think this is the rubber for you"
1316,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"As for reference, I have used various rubbers throughout my table tennis mainly hurricane 3, whale 2, tenergy 05, tenergy 64, joola express 1, tibhar el-s, el-p"
1317,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Me too
1317,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"Important point, as this is where Evolution EL-S also excels"
1317,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Some rubbers have all the power for the NEXT shot, but do not offer any support on the FIRST"
1318,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,I felt that the El-S doesn't offer as much catapult compared to the Gewo so I prefer it a little more than the El-S
1319,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Anyone can compare it to the MX-P?
1320,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"I don't have a sheet of MX-P handy at the moment, but I used to play with it when it just came out"
1320,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, One thing I can definitely remember is the quite noticeable shrinkage of MX-P once the booster airs out
1320,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Whereas after a month of use and a couple of re-gluings, Hype Kr has not shrunk at all"
1321,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"Sponge hardness is identical, but the topsheet is softer"
1321,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min," Easier to play on opening shots, same power in open game"
1322,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Thank you all for the reviews
1323,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"No shrink, I don't know anything about this rubber but it take my attention lol"
1323,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, I love mx-p but the shrink thing is really bad
1323,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Sent from my 2014819 using Tapatalk
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"So, here is the promised update on Hype Kr on FH of an OSP Expert after using it 2 (well, actually 3 since I played 11+7 matches in both open and O40 events on same day) tournaments"
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, * Hype Kr is definitely a faster/more lively/lower throw rubber than EL-S let alone MX-S
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, * Had to adjust my service action a bit (mainly lower ball toss) in order to keep the serves short
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, * No complaints in the spin generation area
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, * Really shines in the 3rd ball attack area and when counter-attacking but one needs to hit with a more closed bat otherwise it is easy to overhit
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, * Still does not seem to have shrunk at all
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, * No loss of topsheet grip yet
1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min, Decided to keep using it till the end of the 2017/2018 season (or till it dies)

1333,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, I'm still pretty new here in TTD
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers,"I don't know if I would put this in any real order:Forehand rubbers: Tenergy 05Tenergy 64Hurricane III NEOXiom Omega IV ProBackhand Rubbers:Tenergy 05 FXTenergy 64Tenergy 05Xiom Omega IV EuropeThere are lots of other rubbers that are okay and fine but that I don't really like and top 10 seems like a lot for rubbers when really, there are only a few rubbers I really want to use"
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers," If money was not an issue, I would just go with Tenergy 05 for my forehand and Tenergy 05 FX for my backhand"
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, I am about to change my setup to this:Stiga Allround EvolutionXiom Omega IV Pro (black) FHXiom Omega IV Europe (red) BHThe rubbers are on their way
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, I have tried them
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, I like them
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, I am making that change because it was recommended to me by a friend who is a pro
1334,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers," He said that, for what I need to work on I should use softer Euro/Japanese type rubbers and work on letting the ball sink into the rubber and letting the rubber grab the ball instead of using the Hard Chinese rubbers I have been using on my forehand"
1335,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers,"Many people change now to Xiom rubbers, i also play them a long time now, and i really like it"
1335,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, Especially a hard Vega IV Pro on my backhand
1335,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, Nice to see that they can compete in european markets so well
1335,5f68776464fe8d59b1ff54cd,Top 10 FH/BH Rubbers, With about 40 they are maybe just above average but worth it's money for intermediary players like us

1414,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,What is your style and ability? And why was Tenergy just okay for you? Too spinny? Too fast? But if it's good on your backhand why doesn't it suit your FH?
1415,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,I had a important tournament and played in the semi against a defender
1415,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05," When trying to topspin the ball just touched the rubber and went straight away, I could not get that soft ball"
1415,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05, Thank you for all the answers! 
1416,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,Defender as in chopper or blocker? It could be that you're not used to a fast rubber like tenergy or you're not giving it enough brushing motion
1417,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,if u cant bring the ball up with tenergy i dont know how you are gonna do it with other rubbersit's just a technique problemi cant get it in sometimes because there are hardly any defenders in tt
1418,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,"Astro S, MX-P or even rubbers from the Bluefire series or Rasant series"

1419,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05, I also love M2 from the Bluefire series for my forehand
1419,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05, Both these rubbers are good options besides Tenergy 05 which I think is a little on the slow side compared to other rubbers
1420,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,I don't think you need a rubber any faster than Tenergy 05 on FH unless you smack the ball and not looping it

1445,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,And can the rubber stay on my bat or should it be loose
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,Ok
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, Haha
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???," Sorry, now i gotcha"
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???," Many players use just baby oil or lamp oil (paraffine oil) without any other booster, 'cause the oil does the 'boosting' trick itself"
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,Applied to the sponge in thin layers it expands the sponge
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???," This expansion makes the topsheet stretch as well and puts the rubber under tension which therefore maximizes it's reactivity and general behaviour, so you get an increase in speed, spin and control"
1446,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, (As i already wrote in my first answer)
1447,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"Well, if you want to apply the oil to the sponge i don't know how you want to do it without taking it off the blade, so you have to take it off carefully, then apply the oil, let it rest a while and then reglue it on your blade"
1447,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, The process is described more detailed in the link i've posted
1448,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,how many layers of babyoil should the sponge have and for how long to dry
1449,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,The more baby oil you put on the more of a boost effect you get so the amount you should put on depends on the amount of boost effect you want
1449,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???," And as Suga D has already said, you have to take the rubbers off your racket to put the oil on the sponge"
1449,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, You could put a small amount of baby oil on the topsheet if the topsheet has lost its grip and that sometimes revives a bit of the grip
1449,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, But putting the oil on the sponge is how you use it to expand and soften the sponge

1450,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,Okay niceBut what is best to you when i dont have any reel booster
1451,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,And is there any way to get my neo 3 rubber faster???
1452,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,While you wait for your answer tell me is your sheet tacky? I'm thinking of trying DHS in particular and wanted to know if your rubber can pick up and hold a ball
1452,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, It seems the world of DHS is full of variables
1452,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, Has nobody tried the new Hurricane 8 and compared it to the older once yet?
1453,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"yes its tacky but only the first time i could pick up the ballits dead rubber when the bold hit it, but i spins very much, so if your using your hole body its perfektmy choose rigt now is my red neo3 2,0 i fh and my black tenergy 5 1,9 i backhandit worked perfekt to training yesterdaybur remember it requires to youse the hole body in fh with neo 3"
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"Yeah thanks on that info, in that case it seems im already playing with something similar and maybe there is no need to try a Hurricane for this reason"
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, The friendship transcend Im testing maybe just as tacky as the ratings claim
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???," I just didnt like the fact that it can barely lift the ball for a second and this always seems to vary (sometimes never sometimes 2 seconds), it also doesn't stick like glue when it bounces as people show in videos"
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, As for playing style yes I agree that it requires full body motion to execute well
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, It has also helped me on the short game the way it slows down when you need to
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, Plays excellent when boosted
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???," Anyway that's all I wondered, if the Hurricane is better than the Friendship Transcend, in case Im missing on more spin etc"
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, This rubber does allow me to play full swing though and people on the receiving end have already commented how much more spin there is compared to when I chicken wing it
1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???, I was surprised to hear this as I havent mentioned to them I switched rubbers
1455,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,How do i boost my neo 3 rubber??and what effect does it do then???

1481,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3,"just remember when looking at chinese style rubbers : the power comes from your technique and body strength, not the rubber"
1481,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3, anyone can have bad technique with a super fast setup and think they're playing an offensive/looper style
1481,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3, speed increases as your technique and footwork gets better
1481,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3, please read the article in the first post in the following thread :http://www

1483,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3,"Baracuda is incredibly spinny, but slower than other modern tensor rubbers"
1484,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3,This thread carries a seriously HIGH hijack potential
1484,5f6878b064fe8d59b1ff5592,Hurricane 3 Neo Or Hurricane 3, 
1485,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,I have made the mistake of believing the hype and tried both
1485,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, Don't waster your money
1485,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," Just get DHS H3 Neo commercial, add one layer of falco, and enjoy"
1485,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, There is no discernible difference between the result and DHS H3 Neo National unless you believe that blue-coloured sponge has magic properties
1486,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I like my Airocs which got a blue spoonge, but I highly doubt it has anything to do with the color of course"
1486,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, You can always try both rubbers to see for yourself but I don't think the color has something to do with how the rubbers perform
1486,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, How much is the difference in price? Remember that it's often not the price that determines if the rubber is good or not
1486,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, 
1487,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,at one place its about £5 but out of stock the other one is about £25 (The difference that it)
1488,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Really, but the national version is said to be a lot quicker etc"
1488,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,? how well does falco work? isnt it meant to be banned now anyway
1489,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"It is not ""a lot quicker"""
1489,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, Regular DHS Neo H3 commercial is perfectly playable on a 5ply allround blade like OSP Expert
1489,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, One just needs not to be afraid to actually hit the ball
1489,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, Some people claim that one rubber is faster/spinnier than another by 3-5%
1489,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, It always makes me wonder how they measure that without investing into an expensive high-speed camera like the one used in PathfinderPro's videos on YT
1489,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," Falco works quite well on many rubber sponges, not just DHS, - the chemical reaction it induces expands the sponge making it springier and a bit faster, if you feel you need the speed"
1490,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Yh I know what you mean, if i do try the chinese rubbers i will definately just use the commercial as the national version is 6 times more expensive and only a small percentage better"
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,I use the NEO commercial version
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," While playing against other club members who have Tenergy's and national version of Hurricane, and also boosted versions, I beat them all(Most of the time)"
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," It is not about the rubber it is about you, and your technique"
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, They are all very good or decent players
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, If anything I think having those rubbers hurts them
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," They use it as a crutch and think that there rubber is going to win points for them and they don't play to the best of their ability with every swing, every point"
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," Needless to say my Hurricane is also a year old, and it still works fine and I play with it every week regularly(2-4 club day)"
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, Still holds alot of spin and control even with a major loss of the tacky topsheet
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"TLDR; It's about your technique, doesn't matter what rubbers you have"
1491,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, Learn to play before worrying about rubbers and equipment
1492,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Have you tried the domestic versions? Do you (or anybody else) no the difference between the domestic versions and the commercial ones? (I know that the domestic versions come in different sponge hardness, I don't think this is the case for the commercial ones?)"
1493,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I havnt personally tried the domestic versions but it says on the TTNPP website ""Domestic Version of Neo rubbers (originally for sell within China region only) provide a more detail labeling about the hardness of the rubber sponge than the oversea versions"
1493,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,available in 39 and 40 degree now
1493,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"The only difference with the oversea version is labeling, quality of rubber are the same"
1493,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"""So yh i hope this helped"
1494,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,How good is the DHS Skyline TG3 Neo? how does it compare to the TG2 neo and the Hurricane 3 Neo?
1495,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,Well the thorw angle is slightly different
1495,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,i found ut easier to counterloop near the table with skLine but hurr has more spin
1496,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,Which one is faster?
1497,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Skyline is faster,But not by much )Its about the feel of the rubber"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"The difference between Blue sponges and Orange sponges is that the blue sponge requires more power to hit ""through"" the rubber"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, It's also more elastic than the orange sponges
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," If you're able to hit through the sponge, the quality of the ball from the blue sponge will be higher than that from the orange sponge"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," But we're talking about world-class playing here, or nearly world-class playing"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," Most of the time, neo provincial hurricane is good enough"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," Neo Hurricanes are meant to be boosted (not trying to start any argument of whether it's legal/illegal to do so lol), so my recommendation would be a neo provincial hurricane that costs about $30? (about 180-200 RMB) and a good booster like Falco Long tempo, Seamoon, or Dianchi"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," As for the hardness, 39 degrees should be hard enough"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," Provincial male team players mostly play with 38-39 degree rubbers, while the girls play with 37-38 degrees usually"
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, 40 is ridiculous for non pros
1499,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"You cannot really say 'the blue sponge requires more power to hit ""through"" the rubber', and the immediately follow it with ""it's also more elastic than the orange sponge"""
1499,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, These statements are contradictory
1500,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,oh sorry i meant more
1500,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"springy? I'm not sure what the word is, but at low power, the orange sponge will feel more ""dead"" than the blue sponge"
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,I've only played with the H3 neo and the TG3 neo (both 39 degree)
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, My bat is the CPEN YEO7P (offensive+) so my impression may not be entirely applicable
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," I find both rubbers to be excellent, with the H3 neo more forgiving towards punch-type shots and the TG3 more forgiving towards loop-type shots, if that makes sense"
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, degree TG3 neo pretty soon
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, I haven't hit enough with the TG2 to draw an impression
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," I feel the TG3N to be better suited for penhold (due to my wrist mechanics, and I've been told I'm more of a spinner than power hitter) and H3N better suited for shakehand "
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," I've been wanting to make a shakehand bat for myself as well, at which point i would choose H3N over the TG3N"
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," I have noticed however that the 39 degrees rubbers require more effort and better timing further away from the table, (even on an offensive+ bat), and the effects doesn't feel quite as linear (less linear with the xuxoafa seemless poly ball)"
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, This more than likely may be due to my bat to be honest
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge, I'm thinking about getting the 40 degree TG3N pretty soon
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge," I fear however, that with the switch to poly balls, both the TG3N and H3N will still great, may lack just a few of the gears (but the gears are def there when playing with the celluloid balls!)"
1502,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,I have ordered the DHS Hurricane Neo National 3 blue sponge will post a in depth review Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
1503,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,Ok that will be cool
1504,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"i'm using hurricane neo 3 comm, well it's good rubber but need more skill and practice to master that rubber"
1504,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"now i'm curious with neo TG3 to replace my T64, so at last i'll have a fair of dhs h3c (FH) and tg3 (BH)"
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"Nice, I'm personally in the same situation but I've been using the Jp 01-Turbo"
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, Not planing on changing unless I get an opertunity to try it (M1-Turbo) and finding out it's better lolz
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, I did in fact do some research before I came to the conclusion of buying Jp-01 Turbo instead of M1-Turbo
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?," As far as I've understood the M1 is a litle bit faster than Jp-01 Turbo, but Jp 01 Turbo is still fast (enough)"
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,Although the throw angle (on Jp-01 Turbo) is a tiny bit lower than Tenergy (at least 80) It's still a litle higher than M1
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, For me the Jp-01 Turbo's throw angle is perfect
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, I've also read the Jp-01 is more forigiving and more smooth when it comes to strokes
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"(I am btw in fact using the Jp 03 on bh, soft-sponge, more control, longer dwelltime and better for my own unperfected backhand) What you could do though, is to try a M1-Turbo(fh)/jp 01 Turbo (bh) combo the next time you buy new sheets of rubber, and then test a litle back and forth"
1505,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?," Maybe give a comperance review here, and then make your choice on rubber after a few weeks of play? Links you could check out about this:http://mytabletennis"

1506,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,Nice
1506,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?," Im using Max on BH and FH, it feels really amazing! But yeah it sounds like a good idea to try JP01 turbo on BH next time"
1506,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, Might be a really good combo 
1507,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,The JP01 is definitely softer and more touchy
1507,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, You can generate more speed and power with the M1 Turbo as it has firmer sponge
1507,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, We have been in the stages of having our equipment expert testing the M1 turbo so hopefully we will have a video and written review prepared for it soon! 
1508,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,Awesome! Im playing with the M1 Turbo and i think it's amazing! 
1509,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"From my experience with M2 and JP02, the M2 provides more spin and speed but the JP02 is easier to control and more forgiving"
1510,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,i´m playing the m1 Turbo on vh an jp01 Turbo on bhthe m1 Turbo is very good for hard Topspins but with less spin than with the jp01 Turboyou have great control with both Rubbersin my opinion the m1 Turbo is a bit harder and so it is very good for vh whereas with the jp01 Turbo it´s easier to produce a lot of spini really enjoy both Rubbers and won´t change in the next few months
1511,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,Nice!! I think i might that combo too next time with m1 turbo on fh and the jp01 turbo on bh :P right now i have m1 turbo max on fh and bh and its really amazing! 
1512,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"Very Nice, I've newly bought another pair of jp 01-turbo/jp 03 (that I have not yet recieved) so could take a while, but I might try that combo the next time my rubbers are worn out again! And M1 is indeed harder, the sponge is 50* on M1 and 47,5* on Jp-01 Turbo"
1512,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?, Dunno wether the rubber itself is harder too or not though
1513,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,I haven't used Palio's Thor since I became a better player so I can't review it
1513,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??, Big Dipper is pretty cheap
1513,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??, Just get a sheet and try it out
1513,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??," IT's not as powerful as some other rubbers from mid distance but it at least, it has more bounce than most tacky Chinese rubber in the 38 deg sponge"
1513,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??, That is its main selling point
1514,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,"About the same speed - probably slower because it is tackier, but faster on the spin end when driving"
1515,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,Yinhe seems to me making the 38 deg much harder now
1515,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??, The rubber is no longer as dynamic as before
1516,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,Palio Thors is terrible
1516,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??," Do not buy it, i used it for a week then switched it for T05, seriously"
1516,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??, I tried the rubber on several blades and it just didnt work for me
1516,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??, It is wayyyy to hard and the sponge is extremely brittle
1517,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,Cant go wrong with either one
1517,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?, Just get the cheaper one lol
1517,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,I would probably go for the Sriver though
1517,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?, Its more destructive than the Mark V
1518,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,"You might actually be better off taking those rubbers and putting them on a slower, all wood blade for a few weeks or months before going back up to your old setup"
1518,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?," Theoretically it should work fine either way, but that blade is fast and hard because of the carbon"
1518,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?," If you got something like a Primorac Off- or a Petr Korbel and used it with the same rubbers for a while, once you got your touch back you can just go back to the old blade and it won't be much of an adjustment because you were using the same rubbers on a blade that is slower with more control"
1518,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?, But if you change the rubbers to Sriver or Mark V then you will still have an adjustment for the rubbers and rubbers like Sriver or Mark V on a TB ALC is a bit weird
1519,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,"If you got problems controlling SLOW, but very spinny Barracuda on the excellent TBS, you will have problems with Sriver too"
1519,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,Try a few mates' bats and discover what works for you
1519,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?, Switching a slow rubber to another slow rubber prolly won't solve your control issue
1520,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,Could it be possible that he's having trouble controlling the sensitivity of spin that Baracuda might have instead of the speed? It's supposed to be one of the spinniest rubbers ever and perhaps it's just reacting to everything like crazy

1523,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, If you're thinking of a rubber from the Tenergy series choose 05!!! 
1524,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,I have to agree with xVill I use Powergrip and after about six to eight weeks it feels like it's completely lost its spin capability
1524,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"If you are looking for pure speed the answer is tenergy 64 however if you want a lot of speed and spin there is the tenergy 05 (these are £50 per sheet and don't last that long) have you thought about other rubbers like Donic Bluefire m1 Turbo I think this is more faster than t64 and amazing spin, lasts a lot longer and is £15 less per sheet"
1524,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Personally I would research a little deeper with what really matches you as a player check out www

1524,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Hope this helps
1525,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,for the powergrip your technique has to be perfect
1525,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, you have to hit every single ball 98-100% correct or the ball falls straight down into the net
1525,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64," The rubber is also very hard, the hardest rubber Ive ever played with so you have to hit every ball on the peak of the bounce or you cant get any power"
1525,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,but the tenergy 64 is more foregiving and alot softer feel
1525,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, so you can take the ball later or on the peak of the bounce or right after the bounce and maintaining the controll
1525,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,So If you have the technique powergrip might be a good one
1526,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"I have tried Rasant, PowerSponge, Power Grip and Grip"
1526,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64," All of them are not even close in terms of performance when compared to their corresponding Tenergy sub products, and they last for an even shorter period of time! The Grip's top sheet does grab the new polyball abit better than the 05 does but thats all there is to it"
1526,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, It starts to shrink like crazy after a few weeks and now i cant even get it to cover the smallest of blades
1526,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,The only thing that comes close to a Tenergy right now on overall is probably Tibhar's Evo series
1526,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, At least thats what i've heard as I only had a few knocks with the FX-P and it does a pretty good job at its price
1527,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Thank you for all your thoughts guys
1527,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, I will do farther research to choose best rubber that fit my beast demon Firehand Fl
1528,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Played with FX-P and for me its completly smashing rubber
1528,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Good choice for bh but for fh much better rubber is MX-P evolution 
1529,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"I like the Evo series and use them on FH and often Aurus, but Evo series is kinda pricy unless you see a temporary promotion"
1530,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Yea,prices are almost like tenergyes "
1531,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Verification, Andro or Butterfly Firehand? Or Andro Fibrecomb? "
1532,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,It's Butterfly Firehand Flared handle bro
1533,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Then i vote for Butterfly Tenergy 64 FX, or Friendship/729 Aurora for tightwad, and you got a pure driver blade"

1540,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Quick example
1540,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, T05 is not as good as T80 when it comes to my backhand
1540,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, It gets abit too weak for my liking when I start stepping away from the table
1540,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64, Also its high sensitivity to spin makes it hard for me to get services back the way I want
1541,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Agree they wear out so fast! Tenergy 64 is a better alternative if you got the money for it

1546,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,It really depends on your game style and your touch
1547,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,Ok in my personal opinion me being a penholder m1 turbo is the better of the two simply because the speed and spin are on a higher bar without really loosing out on the control aspect and that was with using the donic ovtcharov senso v1 (really really fast blade) hope this helps
1548,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,"Thanks, with my blade that it is very fast too, i have a m1 so i want to know if i buy the m1 turbo it could stay uncontrolled"

1548,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?," I really tried m1 turbo but on another blade and i think that was very good about the speed, spin and loop, but i dont know how stays on my blade"

1549,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,No problem just to let you know aswell it has a life span of about 5 months then it starts to go dead
1549,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,i recently bought a andro rasant powergrip and I think that it is better than m1 turbo it's faster and got very good control and not heavy

1554,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,There are a lot of rubbers that have equal or great spin than T05 and because many are softer they have a ton of control
1554,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?, It sounds more like an issue that you're trying to find something similar to T05 but want the control too
1554,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?, That's hard to define since we have no way of knowing which rubber density you like and what your technique and timing is like

1556,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?, you have to be flexible and know diffrent spins for each type of ball

1558,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?, The problem with H3 is that you have to tune it to get it softer while JP comes already soft

1562,5f68795c887afbc97df8388d,Friendship/729 Aurora,no problem with Friendship/729 products because they produce quality equipment also though not as good quality as the high end equipment that are available

1570,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," But actually, I would try some other rubbers to  for example, the STIGA Calibras or the Cornilleau Pulse rubbers are good "
1571,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,i will try the xiom sigma europe soon 
1572,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom Vega Pro! That's what I use, but I haven't tried the new Xiom family yet, maybe they are even better"
1572,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, But their price is getting kinda high as well I believe
1572,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," But the Vega Pro is a good, durable rubber for a decent price"
1573,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I heard that the xiom omega iv series is a very good substitute for tenergy or even better
1574,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,i played with both
1574,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, and i feel no big difference
1574,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," i played with tenergy 05fx, 05 and 64"
1574,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, i liked the 05fx most
1574,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," and i played with omega asia, europe and sigma europe"
1574,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," and the sigma europe is the best of all, i think "
1575,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Yea but xiom prices are definitely better than butterfly
1576,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I bought a sheet of xiom omega 4 euro - and yeah it is fast - it feels faster than all the tenergy I have tried
1576,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, It has a low throw angle and doesn't grip as easily
1576,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I think it is much harder to use than any of the tenergy
1576,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, It does however if you liked the euro style rubbers feel like it has the power from a distance that speed glue once gave us
1576,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," If your a flatter hitter near the table it also beats the tenergy, but if you are a looper and have the money tenergy"
1577,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I would definitely recommend using Xiom rubbers
1577,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I use Omega IV Pro on forehand and Pro Euro on the backhand and they are better than Tenergy
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've never tried Xiom rubbers, but I will be doing so soon"
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, As far as Tenergy 64 it's got great control if you use the right sponge for you
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I've tried 1
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,9 and 2
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,1
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, 1
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,9 is what Joo uses and since he's a defender it's got fantastic control and yet is a good attacking rubber as well
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, 2
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"1 is best for someone who still wants a little bit of control on their block, but also likes to attack the service for 2nd ball attacks"
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," Max is where everyone can lost control at, but with the right technique and practice no rubber can't be controlled"
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Blades are a huge issue as well
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, The less flexible the blade the less control you will have and thus making Tenergy or any rubber out there have less control
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," With Tenergy 64 I recommend anything from ALL - to OFF, but nothing above that if you don't want to lose the control of your block"
1579,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Well I'd go for Xiom, but then it really depends on what kind of player you are as to whether you suit asia, euro or pro"
1579,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, However IIRC Omega IV Pro is the softest?
1580,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Speaking of Asia Pro and Europe Pro what's the difference
1580,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Can anyone verify this?
1581,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I have been using the Xiom Omega Europe (on my spare blade) for a few weeks now and I'm not sure whether it's better then Tenergy
1581,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Nevertheless it's a worthy substitute but i'm not blown away of it's performances
1581,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I guess I'm just going to stick with Tenergy after all
1581,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Huge plus for Xiom is that it's a lot cheaper anyway
1581,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, By the way anyone knows how the durability of Xiom is compared with Tenergy?
1582,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've used Tenergy 05 and Xiom Omega III, and I found the spinniness of Omega lasted longer and overall performance was better"
1583,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've heard good things about the Xiom family, but most loopers love tenergy once they get used to it! Its especially good for backhand looping!"
1584,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've used Tenergy 25, 05 and 64"
1584,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," I liked the 05 on my backhand, but for the rest I've never been crazy about any of them"
1584,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, But that is probably because I compared them to speed glued rubbers :P
1585,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Use Tenergy! i feel that it is much more better than XIOM
1585,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," if u prefer bouncy rubbers try XIOM but if u prefer tensor rubbers, try Tenergy,"
1586,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,On my sheet of Omega IV it says it's a BIOS Tensor
1587,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom omega asia is good, almost same exact feel as tenergy"
1587,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Starting to think that xiom and butterfly know each others secrets 
1587,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Anyway Xiom rubber very good and less price
1587,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, on TTnPP you can get xiom sigma 2 for 35USD!!!!
1588,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Just wondering
1588,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, what Xiom would be closest to T05-FX
1588,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," I'm not ready for a replacement yet, but I like to know my options as I have always considered Xiom if I didn't have the money for another sheet of Tenergy"
1589,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,If you doesn't mind about the price tenergy have their own feel but Xiom is not that specific but it's also a good one
1590,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I feel Xiom has made great improvement these few years
1590,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom imo is might better than Tenergy- much cheaper- durability is similar- more choice to suite your game/styleTenergy is realy onlt doing well, because of Butterfly's market dominant"
1590,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Dominant doesn't mean good product, and that is why we can see so many brands taking business away from ""monopoly"" Tenergy"
1590,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Of course, you have many people that want to use Tenergy because of Butterfly logo"
1590,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," So if they call it Butterfly XYZ, those people will switch to XYZ too"
1591,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom rubbers are also much lighter than the Tenergy series, at least the ones I've tried anyway"
1591,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I now have a sheet of Vega Europe and Omega IV Pro on a Stradivarius blade and it is 13g lighter than what it was before- with Tenergy 05, 05fx"
1592,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Tenergy worth every penny for its performance / durability, my Xiom Sigma 2 Euro and Pro aren't bad rubbers but the durability makes me back to Tenergy"
1593,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Like to ask, how long does a Tenergy last you, vs your S2E?and how many hours per week?I feed a lot with my S2E (easily, 5 hours a week, min 5000 hits), going on for 10 months, and its starting to fade (colour) a bit, but I still feel it is powerful enough to continue using"
1593,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I use Black side to feed
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I used too play with Tenergy 64 on my backhand it was great for me but after all it was a little bit expensive and then I tried Xiom Vega Pro 2,2 mm to be honest when playing I did almost feel no difference at all"
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, but there was one downside and that is the lag of spin on the rubber
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, When playing a fast backhand topspin my opponents usually block it over the table but instead they blocked it into the net
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Im trying Sriver G3-FX at the moment
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Its great for flicking and initiate attacking with the backhand but for the second ball I feel like I have less controll than usual but I gues I still have to get used to the rubber because the sponge is softer than other rubbers I recently used
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Too sad I cant play now due injury :/
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy is by far a better rubber
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I have used xiom omega 3 and omega 4 for about a year and switched to t05 and t64
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," Tenergy gives you much better control for chopping, which, in my view, is a significant weak point of the omega series"
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, It also returns the ball faster when blocking
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," When you flip with bh, you definitely get more power"
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," The only thing is that you need some time to get used to it, especially if you are used to omega series"
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," My impression is for omega seires, the larger your arm swing, the more spin and power you will get"
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," However, with tenergy, you need only small, fast movement to generate power and spin"
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I took me about half a year to get used to it
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, 
1596,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy
1596,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," But be careful, maybe you want to reconsider your decision since 64 are really soft, maybe 05 will be a better choice!"
1597,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I have stayed loyal to Tenergy 05 for quite a while now, but I decided I needed a change"
1597,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?," Did not want to go back to Tibhar's Nimbus so I decided a step in between is the best choice, so I got the Giant Dragons posted on the left"
1597,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"In my opinion, Tenergy is an excellent rubber for your blade but is rather expensive compared to the Xiom"
1597,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I'm gonna stick with Tenergy if you have the financial means (not that it's THAT expensive, just saying)"
1597,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Regards
1598,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy is best
1599,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,From these options I would go with Tenergy
1599,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, If you want a cheap rubber with good speed/spin consider also Rhyzm
1600,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Let me tell you something
1600,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Yasaka Mark V
1600,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, its awesome with a good fast carbon blade
1600,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, and a booster !!no comparison wat so ever 
1600,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,!! 
1601,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,tenergy 64
1602,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"xiom sigma 2 it`s a good choice, one of the guys at my club replaced his sigma pro with T05 and i tell you his top spins where allot more effective with xiom than the tenergy(wierd but it`s true)"
1602,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, I also use sigma euro 2 on my fh
1602,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, ball trajectory is long but doesnt go out also the ball tends to make oponents step back to play it

1604,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Xiom Vega Power!

1606,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,i will chose tenergy 
1607,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Vote Tenergy (second hand not a brand new
1607,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,lol)
1608,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy can offer more spin
1609,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"I haven't been playing for too long, but could it possibly be that your strokes aren't getting the most out of hitting the ball? I feel like you should go with the rubber where you have more consistency/control because once you have that control and good strokes, you should be more accurate when you upgrade the rubber? I could be completely wrong too"
1609,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, 
1610,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,I would recommend as i have been using xiom vega europe for a while now
1610,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Its a really good rubber
1610,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, I would say make about 85 percent of my shots with this rubber
1610,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Along with really spinny serves when i serve with this rubber
1611,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"I would actually say, try Xiom Omega V Europe"
1611,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?," It is in the same price range as Calibra, but that might be what you need"
1611,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, It should spin the ball a little more than Vega but it will feel similar
1611,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, And you will not lose power with Omega V
1612,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"Thanks ttlocust, shiro and UpsideDownCarl"
1613,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,And what do you think about Xiom Omega IV europe UpSideDownCarl? Because my seller don't has the omega V
1614,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,Xiom Omega IV Europe is good
1614,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Xiom Omega V Europe is GREAT
1614,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Omega V is enough better than the other Omegas that I would tell the distributor to get it
1614,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, If they can get Omega IV they can get Omega V
1615,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"Thanks UpsideDownCarl, I will ask my seller if he don't have it because I just saw that Omega V wasn't on his website but sometimes, he has got some rubbers who are not in his website"
1616,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,I haven't played the Omega series but the softness of Vega euro and calibra lt are quite different
1616,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, I reckon the vega euro to be very soft as the calibra to be in medium to hard range
1616,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, How about Vega Pro? @carl could you compare Vega Pro with omega?
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,Vega series is supposed to have more control but it is not as linear
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?," It is good, but the Omegas are 1 or 2 steps up in terms of quality"
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Vegas are still pretty good
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Pro is harder than Europe
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, But a Vega Pro is not as spinny or as explosive as an Omega VI Pro
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?," Omega V Pro, has more power, more spin and is less reactive to incoming spin than Omega IV Pro"
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?," Omega V Pro has more power, speed and spin than a Vega Pro but it has as much control and is about as reactive to incoming spin"
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, Omega V Pro is the closest Xiom gets to the quality of Tenergy
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, That is a really good rubber
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, All of them are good
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, But Omega V Pro is great
1617,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?," Not like Tenergy, but about the same level of quality"
1618,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,I have tried Omega V Tour

1620,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?, You are really amazing guys 
1621,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,You really mean a TEN USD rubber to better T05 and Neo H3 Provincial? I really like to know
1621,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, For a cheap setup I like my YE Cpen with FH 999 Jap sponge and BH Sword Backhand II
1622,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Nooooooo
1622,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," I mean imagine every rubber in this would only cost 10 USD (except the special pro rubbers), would you still use your Stiga Boost over T05 or NH3 or would you change your rubber? Because like I said in my opinion T05 and H3 are the best rubbers for the forehand which are ever produced"
1622,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," So im curious about ppl who still prefer their setup over these two rubbers even if they would be the same price (because Tenergy for example is such an expensive rubber, ppl dont want to pay for this even if they want to play with T05)"
1623,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,I see
1623,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, In that case I believe T05 and Neo H3P already cover the best of both worlds
1623,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, Hard to find any better I guess
1624,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Hurricane 3 Neo National blue sponge rubber is the best on forehand if you know how to use it
1624,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, It is factory boosted and doesn't need boosting
1624,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, But you said National rubber dosen't count
1624,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, So Still Hurricane 3 Neo prov is the the best
1625,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"The spinnier and the best for me, are two different rubbers"
1625,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"The spinniest I used, I really dont know, maybe Sanwei t88-I,on loops, on serves maybe haifu BWII"
1625,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"The best for me is Tibhar 1Q XD on FH and Aurus soft on BH, if I could, I would join the service of BWII, the loop spin from T88-I with the speed of XD"
1625,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Overall I think 1Q XD is the best i can get 
1626,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Interesting
1626,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, What does your 1Q XD better than a H3 or a T05? Im very interested
1627,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,I don't like T05 on fh at allIt is too soft
1628,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"It's not just the rubber you have to consider, you have to consider the blade too"
1628,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," And personal preference!Right now I have the perfect setup for me, but if I were to use another setup, I would probably use the Stiga Clipper Wood with Tenergy rubbers or a Michael Maze Offensive with Bluefire JP01 on both sides"
1628,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," Overall, those are the three rubbers I would call the best rubber "
1629,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,just stick with DHS H3 and T05
1629,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"they are the best, and there is no substitute for them"
1630,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Both T05 and H3 Neo are very decent rubbers in the right hands
1630,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"IMHO, the end result - the spin, the arc, the kick off the bounce, and speed of a shot are far less dependent on the rubber being used and are directly dependant on the technique/skill of the player using it"
1630,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," For example, based on my subjective observation during playing in several local leagues for a couple of years:* the spinniest slow loops are produced by two players who use T25 and Marc V respectively, both use ALL blades"
1630,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"* loops with the highest arc are produced by two players who use T64 and Evolution MX-P respectively, using OFF- blades* a top-20 UK junior using Rhyzm produces the fastest loops* the fastest drive loop is produced by a player using T05 FX on BTY PrimoracAs to players using T05 - there are some very good ones, but quite a few, especially in lower divisions, use it not because its properties suit their game best but simply because someone else told them it was the ""best"" rubber"
1631,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Agree with you
1631,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, I have played with T05 and T64 but still I love my Donic Vario Big Slam more than any rubber for backhand
1632,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,too true regarding other peoples influence
1632,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"Not every1 is the same,with regards to control and skill"
1632,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"some people go after the max versions because others said it was the best,and while doing this,they often leave out crucial training steps and methods,and often dont learn to control their game well"
1633,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"the spinniest rubber I know is thibhar ginius sound, it has a TON of spin"
1633,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, the downside is that the rubber is very soft so its not really the best forehand rubber
1633,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, but maybe if you stick it on a very hard blade it will work out
1634,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"I like tenergy 05 the most on my forehand, there isn't anthing better for me that I have tried"

1634,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?, I really like the nice flicks I can give with my backhand and the very spinny loops I do when I spin when someone pushes
1634,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," But I really have a hard time blcoking the ball and playing 'contra' with the backhand, just ticking the ball and controlling it, if you know what I mean"
1634,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," I have tried genius on my backhand, great control, but no speed and definitely not enough spin"

1645,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, It all depends on the drying process as well

1651,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Is watery

1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Water based glues that are non Chinese name brand are less elastic than the more pasty glues
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, Similar to JOOLA Xglue which is also watery I would imagine the Xiom glue needs at least 3 layers on the rubber and 1-2 on the blade
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, Normally if I have to use this rubber with Euro/Jap rubbers I always put 3-5 on the rubber and 1-2 on the blade
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,For new blades one of my resident pros recommends putting glue on first and then letting it dry and then rubbing it off
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, Because during the drying process or packaging process the blades can pick up micro dust particles which sort of sit in the grain of the wood and then from environment changes humid to dry or vice versa the dust can stick to the blade
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, So the glue helps to remove most if not all of that dust
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Another important thing to mention is that you need to be sure you are spreading the glue evenly
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, Especially in water form many glues can spread out unevenly and cause some issues when hitting
1653,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?, In the case of Tenergy the spring sponge is also more porous so I definitely recommend more layers of glue to prevent issues with the ball slipping or sounding different

I just put on some glue, make sure it's spread out evenly on both rubber and blade and then put the rubbers carefully onto the blade, then I put pressure (sitting on it, or some books) on the racket"
1656,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?," Then it's good to go and no problems have ever appeared OFC some rubbers require more glue, and also I found that I have to use more glue on a new rubber than just a regluing"
1656,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?," But only one layer and boom it's fine Layers of glue and all that is for speed gluing lol Sorry for my arrogance, it's not that, it's just that I wanted to tell whats working for me "

1658,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?," Let the old residue, if the glue layers applied still too thin, you need only put the WBG on the blade as I've said before"
1658,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,2
1658,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?," If you've taken off the glue residue on both(blade and rubber), then you should begin the gluing process like the 1st time gluing(at least 2 layers of the rubber and 2 layers on the blade)The reason why it's better not to use the roller is: the rubber will be streched every time you use the roller"
1658,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"And since the rubber already factory tensioned, you have to be carefull"
1658,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?," (otherwise the rubber shrinkage is too big!)Putting heavier books overnight does not effect the rubber performance, since the pressure is comming from above"

1674,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, But if you have find something you really like I think you should stick with it

1675,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, the only thing i'd add is that it may be better value to spend money on coaching
1676,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options,Sticking to Tenergy is like making a contract with a money pit
1677,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options,"I understand with sticking with what I like, but Like Der_Echte says, tenergy is a big money pit"
1677,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, I would rather not spend large amounts of money even though I do like the feel of 05-FX
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options,Here is the information I would give
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," After a long time of wanting this not to be the case, I have come to the conclusion that Tenergy is REALLY the best offensive rubber out there"
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, This is the case because of a variety of reasons
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," It is not the spinniest rubber out there, it is not the fastest rubber out there, it is not the longest lasting"
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," But, it is one of the fastest, spiniest and longest lasting"
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, There is no offensive rubber that is as good at everything (except chopping) as Tenergy
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," However, not all players can access enough of the gears that Tenergy has to make it worth it"
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," That being said, there are lots of rubbers to use that are more than good enough"
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, I like the Xiom rubbers
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, Omega IV Pro and Europe are pretty decent
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, I like Sigma II Pro and Europe a little better
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," Those cost $45-50, something like that"
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, But then there are a lot of good rubbers that are much less expensive
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, Dawei Saviga is one I used a long time ago that was inexpensive and quite good
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, Dawei Inspirit or Inspirit Quatro are also supposed to be decent
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, I think Der_Echte often recommends another Dawei rubber that is very inexpensive and pretty decent as well: Dawei 2008 XP Super Power
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, Those Dawei rubbers range from $7-16
1678,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, You can get many sheets for the price of one Tenergy or one Sigma II rubber
1679,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options,"I found I like medium to hard rubbers for my forehand, Sigma Euro would be good for that wouldn't it?"
1680,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options,"In Xiom Rubbers Elite is SOFT, Europe is medium soft, Pro is medium and Asia is medium hard"
1680,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options, I like Pro better than Asia though
1680,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options," So if you like medium to hard rubbers for your forehand, I would go with Pro or even try asia"

1701,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?," Besides, Wang Hao never used any of these two rubbers"
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?,"You shouldn't look for a rubber than can do flicks, topspins, loops, and whatever you're looking for"
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?, If you're trying to find a rubber that can do all of that you're looking for the wrong attributes
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?, Your technique is much more important than any rubber
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?, Wang Hao uses' Sriver EL with a bryce sponge because that's what he prefers
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?, His technique however allows whatever rubber he uses to perform those strokes
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?, He can adjust to any rubber and produce the strokes you're looking for
1702,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?,So I would suggest first figuring out where you need to adjust your technique before searching for a perfect rubber

1716,5f687a30887afbc97df83920,FS: Hurricane 3/skyline 3 variants inc NAT/ProvBS, its my mission
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,You are right  Tackiness and stickiness is the same
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,Tacky and grippy is two different thing
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,Tacky means that the topsheet is sticky and slows down the ball unless power is used
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,"Grippy rubbers in the other hand needs to 'wrap' the ball to grip it and propel it forward, usually grippy rubbers are more bouncy compared to its chinese counterparts"
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness, This is called catapult
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,Sponge density (hardness) also play a big role here
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,H3 sponge is rather hard because it needs to compensate the slowness the tackiness bring while Jap/Euro rubber needs rather softer sponge to make sure that the rubber grip the ball enough
1717,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,"Maybe Tin Arc 3 has both characteristics of both tacky chinese topsheet and soft japanese sponge, pretty much like Tibhar Legend Thats what I know  Hope it helps!"
1718,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,I agree with yosua
1719,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,Nice explanation Yosua! Not bad for some one who's not suppose to be herehahahha
1720,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,Good info Yosua
1720,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness," Tacky rubber spins the ball from the topsheet's tackiness (topsheet or tacky spin), and softer grippy rubber uses mechanical spin (when the ball sinks in so that there is more surface area of the topsheet in contact with the ball)"
1720,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness," In general, tacky spin is better for serves, short game and close to the table where you cannot take as big a swing, and mechanical spin is better when you are further back and can take a bigger swing"
1720,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness, Mechanical spin is also better for a backhand loop then tacky spin which is why the Chinese National Team for the most part uses DHS rubber (Hurricane III NEO or Skyline III NEO on the forehand) and Butterfly Tenergy (05 or 64) on the backhand

1726,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness," Why Japanese/European do not make their rubber sticky? And the Chinese must make it sticky, does it mean the Chinese can't perform without sticky rubber? Is there a rule in the ITTF handbook that does not care about stickiness of rubber? Would like to hear from all members"

1727,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness," It has spring sponge technology as T05, but isn't as fast or spinny"
1727,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness," I think is a fact that both Tin Arc's are made in China, but in May-June the Gold Arc and Gold Arc 3 are hitting stores"
1727,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness," What rumor says, Gold Arc is made in China and Gold Arc 3 in Japan"
1727,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness, Perhaps the Gold Arc 3 is going to have some of the same characteristics as Tenergies  Time will show and I am definitely going to try a sheet out if I can save a buck

1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, Water on a sponge is fine and does what you need it to
1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, Not too much water
1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, You want the dust off and the topsheet dry as fast as possible
1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, There are some cleaners that are designed to make the topsheet more tacky for a short time like Spin Max
1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, Those are different but the effect does not last

1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, But oils do cause rubber to break down and will ultimately cause the rubber to be dead sooner

1755,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, Oil on the sponge makes the sponge expand and gives a mild speed glue like effect

1758,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, I would not waste time putting glass cleaner into water when water alone does the job
1758,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, The detergent in the glass cleaner would probably have some of those same chemicals that is in the cleaners from the TT companies that cause the rubber on your topsheet to break down
1758,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?, I think the water based Spin Max just adds a film of something that makes the topsheet a little more tacky until it is washed off

1770,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),I will ask my friends to see if they can help you

1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),Hey Jordan welcome and I'm sure you'll like it here
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), With the H3 Neo you said you seem to block or drive the ball long a lot
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), That is most likely a technique issue
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), I would suggest working on closing your angle about 30-45 degrees when you block and stay low to the table so that it's much easier to do this
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), I've used skyline 2 (tg2 neo) and H3 Neo and I can say they're both great rubbers
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo)," Skyline 2 has a lower throw than the H3, but is also a bit slower"
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), They have the same amount of spin however and it depends on your style
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), I would suggest H3 for Shakehand and skyline 2 for penhold
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),The reviews on Bomb Mopha seem to be the same and I've read that they are primarily a high tension rubber that's both fast and spinny similar to the Euro rubbers
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), I'd say it would be too fast for you if you are a block and drive kind of player
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), H3 and Skyline 3 neo are great rubbers to place the ball well
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),"All in all, I think your issue isn't the rubber"
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), I think you just need to tweak your shot a bit with technique and practice
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), Give the H3 about another 1-2 months and really work on closing your angle when you drive the ball (forward and upwards)
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),As for your backhand if you prefer to block with this I would suggest skyline 2 on the backhand and H3 on the forehand if those are the rubbers you have
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo), Otherwise try to find something a bit faster with a medium sponge so that blocking with your backhand is easier
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo)," Some great backhand chinese rubbers are 729 Super FX, GeoSpin Tacky, Gambler Aces, Focus Snipe 2, Cream with Transcend Sponge"
1771,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),Hope this helps and keep on practicing
1772,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),Thank You both so much for your help  ill just wait a little more in case someone who has played with the bomb mopha replies

1790,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?," I would recommend the Calibra LT Sound for the backhand, because you can do almost anything you want to with this rubber"
1790,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?," For my forehand, I like Boost TX the best, it does not have the same type of trajectory as the Calibra, but its still quiet fast and has excellent touch in the short-short game to! And of course, lots of spin :P"

1804,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,I'm pretty sure the Chinese players favour the hurricane and tenergy rubbers
1805,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,I think the tenergy rubber is over-rated hence its over-priced!!I am sure for the non-pros like us it does not show any difference if any!
1806,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,try haifu whale and shark
1806,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers, they are lighter than h3 neo
1807,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,"Thanks for your reply! I've used haifu whale II before, its definately heavier than H3 neo! Although I found the haifu is more powerful in speed, I prefer the H3 for its feel and spin"
1807,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers," So I like to keep the H3 neo for f/h, but wonder what rubber would be spinny and light for the rpb side?"
1808,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,Non-tacky rubbers are better for RPB usually
1808,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,The Chinese like a tacky FH rubber and a non-tacky RPB rubber
1808,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,Two tacky rubbers will also make the set up a bit heavy for CPen
